austen	emma	she had not time to know how mr. elton took the reproof , so rapidly did another subject succeed ; for mr. john knightley now came into the room from examining the weather , and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow , and of its still snowing fast , with a strong drifting wind ; concluding with these words to mr. woodhouse :
austen	emma	“ no , indeed , ” cried emma , most happy to begin , “ not in the least . i am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you—and to give you joy in person. ” he thanked her with all his heart , and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness .
austen	emma	“ yes , here i am , my good friend ; and here i have been so long , that anywhere else i should think it necessary to apologise ; but , the truth is , that i am waiting for my lord and master . he promised to join me here , and pay his respects to you . ”
austen	emma	“ i can not help wondering at your knowing so little of emma as to say any such thing . what ! think a farmer , ( and with all his sense and all his merit mr. martin is nothing more , ) a good match for my intimate friend ! not regret her leaving highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom i could never admit as an acquaintance of my own ! i wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings . i assure you mine are very different . i must think your statement by no means fair . you are not just to harriet ’ s claims . they would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself ; mr. martin may be the richest of the two , but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society.—the sphere in which she moves is much above his.—it would be a degradation . ”
austen	emma	gratifying , however , and stimulative as was the letter in the material part , its sentiments , she yet found , when it was folded up and returned to mrs. weston , that it had not added any lasting warmth , that she could still do without the writer , and that he must learn to do without her . her intentions were unchanged . her resolution of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation and happiness . his recollection of harriet , and the words which clothed it , the “ beautiful little friend , ” suggested to her the idea of harriet ’ s succeeding her in his affections . was it impossible ? —no.—harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in understanding ; but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner ; and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour.—for harriet , it would be advantageous and delightful indeed .
austen	emma	emma was silenced . “ my brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring , or summer at farthest , ” continued mrs. elton ; “ and that will be our time for exploring . while they are with us , we shall explore a great deal , i dare say . they will have their barouche-landau , of course , which holds four perfectly ; and therefore , without saying any thing of _our_ carriage , we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well . they would hardly come in their chaise , i think , at that season of the year . indeed , when the time draws on , i shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche-landau ; it will be so very much preferable . when people come into a beautiful country of this sort , you know , miss woodhouse , one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible ; and mr. suckling is extremely fond of exploring . we explored to king ’ s-weston twice last summer , in that way , most delightfully , just after their first having the barouche-landau . you have many parties of that kind here , i suppose , miss woodhouse , every summer ? ”
austen	emma	“ _you_ probably have been less surprized than any of us , for you have had your suspicions.—i have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution.—i wish i had attended to it—but— ( with a sinking voice and a heavy sigh ) i seem to have been doomed to blindness . ”
austen	emma	“ in one respect , perhaps , mr. elton ’ s manners are superior to mr. knightley ’ s or mr. weston ’ s . they have more gentleness . they might be more safely held up as a pattern . there is an openness , a quickness , almost a bluntness in mr. weston , which every body likes in _him_ , because there is so much good-humour with it—but that would not do to be copied . neither would mr. knightley ’ s downright , decided , commanding sort of manner , though it suits _him_ very well ; his figure , and look , and situation in life seem to allow it ; but if any young man were to set about copying him , he would not be sufferable . on the contrary , i think a young man might be very safely recommended to take mr. elton as a model . mr. elton is good-humoured , cheerful , obliging , and gentle . he seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late . i do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us , harriet , by additional softness , but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be . if he means any thing , it must be to please you . did not i tell you what he said of you the other day ? ”
austen	emma	“ you have given miss smith all that she required , ” said he ; “ you have made her graceful and easy . she was a beautiful creature when she came to you , but , in my opinion , the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature . ”
austen	emma	“ oh ! my dear , human flesh ! you quite shock me ; if you mean a fling at the slave-trade , i assure you mr. suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition . ”
austen	emma	“ what ! ” said mrs. weston , “ have not you finished it yet ? you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate. ” “ i have not been working uninterruptedly , ” he replied , “ i have been assisting miss fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily , it was not quite firm ; an unevenness in the floor , i believe . you see we have been wedging one leg with paper . this was very kind of you to be persuaded to come . i was almost afraid you would be hurrying home . ”
austen	emma	“ mr . knightley , ” said emma , trying to be lively , but really confused— “ i am in a very extraordinary situation . i can not let you continue in your error ; and yet , perhaps , since my manners gave such an impression , i have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that i never have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of , as it might be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.—but i never have . ”
austen	emma	the rest of the gentlemen being now in the room , emma found herself obliged to turn from him for a few minutes , and listen to mr. cole . when mr. cole had moved away , and her attention could be restored as before , she saw frank churchill looking intently across the room at miss fairfax , who was sitting exactly opposite .
austen	emma	how the trampers might have behaved , had the young ladies been more courageous , must be doubtful ; but such an invitation for attack could not be resisted ; and harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children , headed by a stout woman and a great boy , all clamorous , and impertinent in look , though not absolutely in word.—more and more frightened , she immediately promised them money , and taking out her purse , gave them a shilling , and begged them not to want more , or to use her ill.—she was then able to walk , though but slowly , and was moving away—but her terror and her purse were too tempting , and she was followed , or rather surrounded , by the whole gang , demanding more .
austen	emma	the subject followed ; it was in plain , unaffected , gentlemanlike english , such as mr. knightley used even to the woman he was in love with , how to be able to ask her to marry him , without attacking the happiness of her father . emma ’ s answer was ready at the first word . “ while her dear father lived , any change of condition must be impossible for her . she could never quit him. ” part only of this answer , however , was admitted . the impossibility of her quitting her father , mr. knightley felt as strongly as herself ; but the inadmissibility of any other change , he could not agree to . he had been thinking it over most deeply , most intently ; he had at first hoped to induce mr. woodhouse to remove with her to donwell ; he had wanted to believe it feasible , but his knowledge of mr. woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself long ; and now he confessed his persuasion , that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father ’ s comfort , perhaps even of his life , which must not be hazarded . mr. woodhouse taken from hartfield ! —no , he felt that it ought not to be attempted . but the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this , he trusted his dearest emma would not find in any respect objectionable ; it was , that he should be received at hartfield ; that so long as her father ’ s happiness—in other words , his life—required hartfield to continue her home , it should be his likewise .
austen	emma	“ oh ! then , don ’ t speak it , don ’ t speak it , ” she eagerly cried . “ take a little time , consider , do not commit yourself. ” “ thank you , ” said he , in an accent of deep mortification , and not another syllable followed .
austen	emma	“ do you know miss bates ’ s niece ? that is , i know you must have seen her a hundred times—but are you acquainted ? ” “ oh ! yes ; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to highbury . by the bye , _that_ is almost enough to put one out of conceit with a niece . heaven forbid ! at least , that i should ever bore people half so much about all the knightleys together , as she does about jane fairfax . one is sick of the very name of jane fairfax . every letter from her is read forty times over ; her compliments to all friends go round and round again ; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher , or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother , one hears of nothing else for a month . i wish jane fairfax very well ; but she tires me to death . ”
austen	emma	mr. elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make ; which was exactly the case ; for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a fair lady , and not liking to resist any advice of her ’ s , he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit ; —but emma , too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him impartially , or see him with clear vision , was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its being “ very cold , certainly very cold , ” and walked on , rejoicing in having extricated him from randalls , and secured him the power of sending to inquire after harriet every hour of the evening .
austen	emma	“ poor girl ! ” said emma again . “ she loves him then excessively , i suppose . it must have been from attachment only , that she could be led to form the engagement . her affection must have overpowered her judgment . ”
austen	emma	“ me ! —oh ! no—i would get you a better partner than myself . i am no dancer. ” “ if mrs. gilbert wishes to dance , ” said he , “ i shall have great pleasure , i am sure—for , though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man , and that my dancing days are over , it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like mrs. gilbert . ”
austen	emma	emma looked graciously . “ such a fortnight as it has been ! ” he continued ; “ every day more precious and more delightful than the day before ! —every day making me less fit to bear any other place . happy those , who can remain at highbury ! ”
austen	emma	she was the first to announce it to mr. knightley ; and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary , ( or , being acting a part , perhaps rather more , ) at the conduct of the churchills , in keeping him away . she then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt , of the advantage of such an addition to their confined society in surry ; the pleasure of looking at somebody new ; the gala-day to highbury entire , which the sight of him would have made ; and ending with reflections on the churchills again , found herself directly involved in a disagreement with mr. knightley ; and , to her great amusement , perceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her real opinion , and making use of mrs. weston ’ s arguments against herself .
austen	emma	“ pray say no more . i feel that all the apologies should be on my side . let us forgive each other at once . we must do whatever is to be done quickest , and i think our feelings will lose no time there . i hope you have pleasant accounts from windsor ? ”
austen	emma	these were very cheering thoughts ; and the sight of a great deal of snow on the ground did her further service , for any thing was welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present .
austen	emma	the doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other . “ might not they use both rooms , and dance across the passage ? ” it seemed the best scheme ; and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a better . emma said it would be awkward ; mrs. weston was in distress about the supper ; and mr. woodhouse opposed it earnestly , on the score of health . it made him so very unhappy , indeed , that it could not be persevered in .
austen	emma	jane ’ s alertness in moving , proved her as ready as her aunt had preconceived . she was immediately up , and wanting to quit the table ; but so many were also moving , that she could not get away ; and mr. knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards her , and resolutely swept away by her unexamined . she was afterwards looking for her shawl—frank churchill was looking also—it was growing dusk , and the room was in confusion ; and how they parted , mr. knightley could not tell .
austen	emma	“ i would rather be talking to you , ” he replied ; “ but as it seems a matter of justice , it shall be done. ” he began—stopping , however , almost directly to say , “ had i been offered the sight of one of this gentleman ’ s letters to his mother-in-law a few months ago , emma , it would not have been taken with such indifference . ”
austen	emma	“ i always told you she was—a little ; but you will soon overcome all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome , all that has its foundation in diffidence . what arises from discretion must be honoured . ”
austen	emma	“ will mr. frank churchill pass through bath as well as oxford ? ” —was a question , however , which did not augur much . but neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once , and emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time .
austen	emma	“ what a very great pleasure it will be to you ! and mrs. weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him , that she must be almost as happy as yourself . ”
austen	emma	“ harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother and sister are here . i am sure she will be pleased with the children . we are very proud of the children , are not we , papa ? i wonder which she will think the handsomest , henry or john ? ”
austen	emma	the ball proceeded pleasantly . the anxious cares , the incessant attentions of mrs. weston , were not thrown away . every body seemed happy ; and the praise of being a delightful ball , which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be , was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this . of very important , very recordable events , it was not more productive than such meetings usually are . there was one , however , which emma thought something of.—the two last dances before supper were begun , and harriet had no partner ; —the only young lady sitting down ; —and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers , that how there could be any one disengaged was the wonder ! —but emma ’ s wonder lessened soon afterwards , on seeing mr. elton sauntering about . he would not ask harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided : she was sure he would not—and she was expecting him every moment to escape into the card-room .
austen	emma	“ how d ’ ye do ? —how d ’ ye do ? —very well , i thank you . so obliged to you for the carriage last night . we were just in time ; my mother just ready for us . pray come in ; do come in . you will find some friends here . ”
austen	emma	poor harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that emma could give . emma felt that she could not do too much for her , that harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience ; but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing any effect , for ever agreed to , without being able to make their opinions the same . harriet listened submissively , and said “ it was very true—it was just as miss woodhouse described—it was not worth while to think about them—and she would not think about them any longer ” but no change of subject could avail , and the next half-hour saw her as anxious and restless about the eltons as before . at last emma attacked her on another ground .
austen	emma	“ must i go first ? i really am ashamed of always leading the way. ” jane ’ s solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped emma . she had heard and seen it all ; and felt some curiosity to know whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any . she suspected that it _had_ ; that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear , and that it had not been in vain . she thought there was an air of greater happiness than usual—a glow both of complexion and spirits .
austen	emma	“ ah ! there is one difficulty unprovided for , ” cried emma . “ i am sure william larkins will not like it . you must get his consent before you ask mine. ” she promised , however , to think of it ; and pretty nearly promised , moreover , to think of it , with the intention of finding it a very good scheme .
austen	emma	“ you are right . it does relate to him , and i will tell you directly ; ” ( resuming her work , and seeming resolved against looking up . ) “ he has been here this very morning , on a most extraordinary errand . it is impossible to express our surprize . he came to speak to his father on a subject , —to announce an attachment— ”
austen	emma	“ aye , i see what you are thinking of , the pianoforte . what is to become of that ? —very true . poor dear jane was talking of it just now.— ‘ you must go , ’ said she . ‘ you and i must part . you will have no business here.—let it stay , however , ’ said she ; ‘ give it houseroom till colonel campbell comes back . i shall talk about it to him ; he will settle for me ; he will help me out of all my difficulties. ’ —and to this day , i do believe , she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter ’ s . ”
austen	emma	“ but every thing of that kind , ” said emma , “ will soon be in so regular a train— ” “ well , ” said mrs. elton , laughing , “ we shall see. ” emma , finding her so determined upon neglecting her music , had nothing more to say ; and , after a moment ’ s pause , mrs. elton chose another subject .
austen	emma	“ it appears to me a plan that nobody can object to , if mr. and mrs. weston do not . i think it admirable ; and , as far as i can answer for myself , shall be most happy—it seems the only improvement that could be . papa , do you not think it an excellent improvement ? ”
austen	emma	“ poor mrs. churchill ! no doubt she had been suffering a great deal : more than any body had ever supposed—and continual pain would try the temper . it was a sad event—a great shock—with all her faults , what would mr. churchill do without her ? mr. churchill ’ s loss would be dreadful indeed . mr. churchill would never get over it. ” —even mr. weston shook his head , and looked solemn , and said , “ ah ! poor woman , who would have thought it ! ” and resolved , that his mourning should be as handsome as possible ; and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense , true and steady . how it would affect frank was among the earliest thoughts of both . it was also a very early speculation with emma . the character of mrs. churchill , the grief of her husband—her mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion—and then rested with lightened feelings on how frank might be affected by the event , how benefited , how freed . she saw in a moment all the possible good . now , an attachment to harriet smith would have nothing to encounter . mr. churchill , independent of his wife , was feared by nobody ; an easy , guidable man , to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew . all that remained to be wished was , that the nephew should form the attachment , as , with all her goodwill in the cause , emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed .
austen	emma	“ that may be—but not by sketches in swisserland . you will never go to swisserland . your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave england. ” “ they may be induced to go too . a warm climate may be prescribed for her . i have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad . i assure you i have . i feel a strong persuasion , this morning , that i shall soon be abroad . i ought to travel . i am tired of doing nothing . i want a change . i am serious , miss woodhouse , whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy—i am sick of england—and would leave it to-morrow , if i could . ”
austen	emma	“ _his_ sufferings , ” replied emma dryly , “ do not appear to have done him much harm . well , and how did mr. churchill take it ? ” “ most favourably for his nephew—gave his consent with scarcely a difficulty . conceive what the events of a week have done in that family ! while poor mrs. churchill lived , i suppose there could not have been a hope , a chance , a possibility ; —but scarcely are her remains at rest in the family vault , than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required . what a blessing it is , when undue influence does not survive the grave ! —he gave his consent with very little persuasion . ”
austen	emma	“ but she is so fond of the nephew : he is so very great a favourite . now , according to my idea of mrs. churchill , it would be most natural , that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband , to whom she owes every thing , while she exercises incessant caprice towards _him_ , she should frequently be governed by the nephew , to whom she owes nothing at all . ”
austen	emma	mr. john knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure , but said only , coolly , “ i can not wish to be snowed up a week at randalls. ” at another time emma might have been amused , but she was too much astonished now at mr. elton ’ s spirits for other feelings . harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party .
austen	emma	“ he is a person i never think of from one month ’ s end to another , ” said mr. knightley , with a degree of vexation , which made emma immediately talk of something else , though she could not comprehend why he should be angry .
austen	emma	“ that ’ s right , my dear , very right . i had not thought of it before , but that is the best way . they must not over-salt the leg ; and then , if it is not over-salted , and if it is very thoroughly boiled , just as serle boils ours , and eaten very moderately of , with a boiled turnip , and a little carrot or parsnip , i do not consider it unwholesome . ”
austen	emma	it was a very extraordinary thing ! nothing of the sort had ever occurred before to any young ladies in the place , within her memory ; no rencontre , no alarm of the kind ; —and now it had happened to the very person , and at the very hour , when the other very person was chancing to pass by to rescue her ! —it certainly was very extraordinary ! —and knowing , as she did , the favourable state of mind of each at this period , it struck her the more . he was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself , she just recovering from her mania for mr. elton . it seemed as if every thing united to promise the most interesting consequences . it was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly recommending each to the other .
austen	emma	highbury , the large and populous village , almost amounting to a town , to which hartfield , in spite of its separate lawn , and shrubberies , and name , did really belong , afforded her no equals . the woodhouses were first in consequence there . all looked up to them . she had many acquaintance in the place , for her father was universally civil , but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of miss taylor for even half a day . it was a melancholy change ; and emma could not but sigh over it , and wish for impossible things , till her father awoke , and made it necessary to be cheerful . his spirits required support . he was a nervous man , easily depressed ; fond of every body that he was used to , and hating to part with them ; hating change of every kind . matrimony , as the origin of change , was always disagreeable ; and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter ’ s marrying , nor could ever speak of her but with compassion , though it had been entirely a match of affection , when he was now obliged to part with miss taylor too ; and from his habits of gentle selfishness , and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself , he was very much disposed to think miss taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them , and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at hartfield . emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could , to keep him from such thoughts ; but when tea came , it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner ,
austen	emma	“ i had a few lines on parish business from mr. weston this morning , and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened. ” emma was quite relieved , and could presently say , with a little more composure ,
austen	emma	“ and the staircase—you know , as i came in , i observed how very like the staircase was ; placed exactly in the same part of the house . i really could not help exclaiming ! i assure you , miss woodhouse , it is very delightful to me , to be reminded of a place i am so extremely partial to as maple grove . i have spent so many happy months there ! ( with a little sigh of sentiment ) . a charming place , undoubtedly . every body who sees it is struck by its beauty ; but to me , it has been quite a home . whenever you are transplanted , like me , miss woodhouse , you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind . i always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony . ”
austen	emma	“ charming miss woodhouse ! allow me to interpret this interesting silence . it confesses that you have long understood me. ” “ no , sir , ” cried emma , “ it confesses no such thing . so far from having long understood you , i have been in a most complete error with respect to your views , till this moment . as to myself , i am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings—nothing could be farther from my wishes—your attachment to my friend harriet—your pursuit of her , ( pursuit , it appeared , ) gave me great pleasure , and i have been very earnestly wishing you success : but had i supposed that she were not your attraction to hartfield , i should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent . am i to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to miss smith ? —that you have never thought seriously of her ? ”
austen	emma	“ oh ! no , no ” —cried emma , laughing as carelessly as she could— “ upon no account in the world . it is the very last thing i would stand the brunt of just now . let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of . i will not say quite all . there are one or two , perhaps , ( glancing at mr. weston and harriet , ) whose thoughts i might not be afraid of knowing . ”
austen	emma	“ here is something quite new to me . do you know it ? —cramer.—and here are a new set of irish melodies . that , from such a quarter , one might expect . this was all sent with the instrument . very thoughtful of colonel campbell , was not it ? —he knew miss fairfax could have no music here . i honour that part of the attention particularly ; it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart . nothing hastily done ; nothing incomplete . true affection only could have prompted it . ”
austen	emma	she had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait . it was to be a whole-length in water-colours , like mr. john knightley ’ s , and was destined , if she could please herself , to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece .
austen	emma	“ and do you see her , sir , tolerably often ? ” asked isabella in the plaintive tone which just suited her father . mr. woodhouse hesitated.— “ not near so often , my dear , as i could wish . ”
austen	emma	this emma felt was aimed at her ; and it made her quite angry . it was not in compliment to jane fairfax however that he was so indifferent , or so indignant ; he was not guided by _her_ feelings in reprobating the ball , for _she_ enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree . it made her animated—open hearted—she voluntarily said ; —
austen	emma	short letters from frank were received at randalls , communicating all that was immediately important of their state and plans . mr. churchill was better than could be expected ; and their first removal , on the departure of the funeral for yorkshire , was to be to the house of a very old friend in windsor , to whom mr. churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years . at present , there was nothing to be done for harriet ; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on emma ’ s side .
austen	emma	“ my advice , ” said mrs. weston kindly and persuasively , “ i certainly do feel tempted to give . miss fairfax , you must not run such risks.—liable as you have been to severe colds , indeed you ought to be particularly careful , especially at this time of year . the spring i always think requires more than common care . better wait an hour or two , or even half a day for your letters , than run the risk of bringing on your cough again . now do not you feel that you had ? yes , i am sure you are much too reasonable . you look as if you would not do such a thing again . ”
austen	emma	it was a sad change . they had been meeting almost every day since his arrival . certainly his being at randalls had given great spirit to the last two weeks—indescribable spirit ; the idea , the expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought , the assurance of his attentions , his liveliness , his manners ! it had been a very happy fortnight , and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common course of hartfield days . to complete every other recommendation , he had _almost_ told her that he loved her . what strength , or what constancy of affection he might be subject to , was another point ; but at present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration , a conscious preference of herself ; and this persuasion , joined to all the rest , made her think that she _must_ be a little in love with him , in spite of every previous determination against it .
austen	emma	when the gloves were bought , and they had quitted the shop again , “ did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of , play ? ” said frank churchill . “ ever hear her ! ” repeated emma . “ you forget how much she belongs to highbury . i have heard her every year of our lives since we both began . she plays charmingly . ”
austen	emma	the substance of this letter was forwarded to emma , in a note from mrs. weston , instantly . as to his going , it was inevitable . he must be gone within a few hours , though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt , to lessen his repugnance . he knew her illnesses ; they never occurred but for her own convenience .
austen	emma	emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little self-willed , and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her ; but she took the compliment , and forgave the rest . had she intended ever to _marry_ him , it might have been worth while to pause and consider , and try to understand the value of his preference , and the character of his temper ; but for all the purposes of their acquaintance , he was quite amiable enough .
austen	emma	“ true , true , ” cried mr. knightley , with most ready interposition— “ very true . that ’ s a consideration indeed.—but john , as to what i was telling you of my idea of moving the path to langham , of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows , i can not conceive any difficulty . i should not attempt it , if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the highbury people , but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path .... the only way of proving it , however , will be to turn to our maps . i shall see you at the abbey to-morrow morning i hope , and then we will look them over , and you shall give me your opinion . ”
austen	emma	“ it is very natural . it is natural , and it is honourable.—yes , honourable , i think , to chuse so well and so gratefully.—but that it will be a fortunate preference is more than i can promise . i do not advise you to give way to it , harriet . i do not by any means engage for its being returned . consider what you are about . perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can : at any rate do not let them carry you far , unless you are persuaded of his liking you . be observant of him . let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations . i give you this caution now , because i shall never speak to you again on the subject . i am determined against all interference . henceforward i know nothing of the matter . let no name ever pass our lips . we were very wrong before ; we will be cautious now.—he is your superior , no doubt , and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature ; but yet , harriet , more wonderful things have taken place , there have been matches of greater disparity . but take care of yourself . i would not have you too sanguine ; though , however it may end , be assured your raising your thoughts to _him_ , is a mark of good taste which i shall always know how to value . ”
austen	emma	harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager exclamation . emma continued , “ i have not said , exert yourself harriet for my sake ; think less , talk less of mr. elton for my sake ; because for your own sake rather , i would wish it to be done , for the sake of what is more important than my comfort , a habit of self-command in you , a consideration of what is your duty , an attention to propriety , an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others , to save your health and credit , and restore your tranquillity . these are the motives which i have been pressing on you . they are very important—and sorry i am that you can not feel them sufficiently to act upon them . my being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration . i want you to save yourself from greater pain . perhaps i may sometimes have felt that harriet would not forget what was due—or rather what would be kind by me . ”
austen	emma	“ how d ’ ye do ? —how d ’ ye do ? —we have been sitting with your father—glad to see him so well . frank comes to-morrow—i had a letter this morning—we see him to-morrow by dinner-time to a certainty—he is at oxford to-day , and he comes for a whole fortnight ; i knew it would be so . if he had come at christmas he could not have staid three days ; i was always glad he did not come at christmas ; now we are going to have just the right weather for him , fine , dry , settled weather . we shall enjoy him completely ; every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish . ”
austen	emma	“ my dear emma , ” said he at last , with earnest kindness , “ do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of ? ”
austen	emma	“ well ! that is quite—i suppose there never was a piece of news more generally interesting . my dear sir , you really are too bountiful . my mother desires her very best compliments and regards , and a thousand thanks , and says you really quite oppress her . ”
austen	emma	“ i can not make a question , or listen to a question about that . it is a certainty . receive it on my judgment . it is a sort of prologue to the play , a motto to the chapter ; and will be soon followed by matter-of-fact prose . ”
austen	emma	the event was more favourable to mr. woodhouse than to emma . john knightley came ; but mr. weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and must be absent on the very day . he might be able to join them in the evening , but certainly not to dinner . mr. woodhouse was quite at ease ; and the seeing him so , with the arrival of the little boys and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate , removed the chief of even emma ’ s vexation .
austen	emma	chapter xiv mrs. elton was first seen at church : but though devotion might be interrupted , curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew , and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid , to settle whether she were very pretty indeed , or only rather pretty , or not pretty at all .
austen	emma	“ but , my dear papa , you are no friend to matrimony ; and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _bride_ ? it ought to be no recommendation to _you_ . it is encouraging people to marry if you make so much of them . ”
austen	emma	“ i am very glad i did think of her . it was very lucky , for i would not have had poor james think himself slighted upon any account ; and i am sure she will make a very good servant : she is a civil , pretty-spoken girl ; i have a great opinion of her . whenever i see her , she always curtseys and asks me how i do , in a very pretty manner ; and when you have had her here to do needlework , i observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it . i am sure she will be an excellent servant ; and it will be a great comfort to poor miss taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see . whenever james goes over to see his daughter , you know , she will be hearing of us . he will be able to tell her how we all are . ”
austen	emma	the carriage came : and mr. woodhouse , always the first object on such occasions , was carefully attended to his own by mr. knightley and mr. weston ; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen , and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for . “ he was afraid they should have a very bad drive . he was afraid poor isabella would not like it . and there would be poor emma in the carriage behind . he did not know what they had best do . they must keep as much together as they could ; ” and james was talked to , and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage .
austen	emma	at this moment frank began talking so vigorously , that emma could not but imagine he had overheard his own praises , and did not want to hear more ; —and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while , till another suspension brought mrs. elton ’ s tones again distinctly forward.—mr . elton had just joined them , and his wife was exclaiming ,
austen	emma	“ poor girl ! ” said emma . “ she thinks herself wrong , then , for having consented to a private engagement ? ” “ wrong ! no one , i believe , can blame her more than she is disposed to blame herself . ‘ the consequence , ’ said she , ‘ has been a state of perpetual suffering to me ; and so it ought . but after all the punishment that misconduct can bring , it is still not less misconduct . pain is no expiation . i never can be blameless . i have been acting contrary to all my sense of right ; and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken , and the kindness i am now receiving , is what my conscience tells me ought not to be. ’ ‘ do not imagine , madam , ’ she continued , ‘ that i was taught wrong . do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought me up . the error has been all my own ; and i do assure you that , with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give , i shall yet dread making the story known to colonel campbell . ’ ”
austen	emma	the other circumstance of regret related also to jane fairfax ; and there she had no doubt . she did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing . she did most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood—and sat down and practised vigorously an hour and a half .
austen	emma	“ with all my heart . i am really tired of exploring so long on one spot . come , jane , take my other arm. ” jane declined it , however , and the husband and wife walked off . “ happy couple ! ” said frank churchill , as soon as they were out of hearing : — “ how well they suit one another ! —very lucky—marrying as they did , upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place ! —they only knew each other , i think , a few weeks in bath ! peculiarly lucky ! —for as to any real knowledge of a person ’ s disposition that bath , or any public place , can give—it is all nothing ; there can be no knowledge . it is only by seeing women in their own homes , among their own set , just as they always are , that you can form any just judgment . short of that , it is all guess and luck—and will generally be ill-luck . how many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance , and rued it all the rest of his life ! ”
austen	emma	“ well , ” said emma , “ there is no disputing about taste.—at least you admire her except her complexion. ” he shook his head and laughed.— “ i can not separate miss fairfax and her complexion. ” “ did you see her often at weymouth ? were you often in the same society ? ”
austen	emma	emma , on reaching home , called the housekeeper directly , to an examination of her stores ; and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily despatched to miss bates with a most friendly note . in half an hour the arrowroot was returned , with a thousand thanks from miss bates , but “ dear jane would not be satisfied without its being sent back ; it was a thing she could not take—and , moreover , she insisted on her saying , that she was not at all in want of any thing . ”
austen	emma	“ nothing at all . but is not this a sudden scheme ? ” “ yes—rather—i have been thinking of it some little time. ” emma was sure he had not forgiven her ; he looked unlike himself . time , however , she thought , would tell him that they ought to be friends again . while he stood , as if meaning to go , but not going—her father began his inquiries .
austen	emma	“ oh ! yes , gloves and every thing . i do admire your patriotism . you will be adored in highbury . you were very popular before you came , because you were mr. weston ’ s son—but lay out half a guinea at ford ’ s , and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues . ”
austen	emma	mrs. john knightley was a pretty , elegant little woman , of gentle , quiet manners , and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate ; wrapt up in her family ; a devoted wife , a doating mother , and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that , but for these higher ties , a warmer love might have seemed impossible . she could never see a fault in any of them . she was not a woman of strong understanding or any quickness ; and with this resemblance of her father , she inherited also much of his constitution ; was delicate in her own health , over-careful of that of her children , had many fears and many nerves , and was as fond of her own mr. wingfield in town as her father could be of mr. perry . they were alike too , in a general benevolence of temper , and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance .
austen	emma	“ this will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements , sir . something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow. ” poor mr. woodhouse was silent from consternation ; but every body else had something to say ; every body was either surprized or not surprized , and had some question to ask , or some comfort to offer . mrs. weston and emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his son-in-law , who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly .
austen	emma	“ knightley has taken pity on poor little miss smith ! —very good-natured , i declare. ” supper was announced . the move began ; and miss bates might be heard from that moment , without interruption , till her being seated at table and taking up her spoon .
austen	emma	kitty , a fair but frozen maid , kindled a flame i yet deplore , the hood-wink ’ d boy i called to aid , though of his near approach afraid , so fatal to my suit before .
austen	emma	“ on the misery of what she had suffered , during the concealment of so many months , ” continued mrs. weston , “ she was energetic . this was one of her expressions . ‘ i will not say , that since i entered into the engagement i have not had some happy moments ; but i can say , that i have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour : ’ —and the quivering lip , emma , which uttered it , was an attestation that i felt at my heart . ”
austen	emma	when first sounded on the subject , he was so miserable , that they were almost hopeless.—a second allusion , indeed , gave less pain.—he began to think it was to be , and that he could not prevent it—a very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation . still , however , he was not happy . nay , he appeared so much otherwise , that his daughter ’ s courage failed . she could not bear to see him suffering , to know him fancying himself neglected ; and though her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the mr. knightleys , that when once the event were over , his distress would be soon over too , she hesitated—she could not proceed .
austen	emma	as they were turning into the grounds , mr. perry passed by on horseback . the gentlemen spoke of his horse . “ by the bye , ” said frank churchill to mrs. weston presently , “ what became of mr. perry ’ s plan of setting up his carriage ? ”
austen	emma	their first pause was at the crown inn , an inconsiderable house , though the principal one of the sort , where a couple of pair of post-horses were kept , more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any run on the road ; and his companions had not expected to be detained by any interest excited there ; but in passing it they gave the history of the large room visibly added ; it had been built many years ago for a ball-room , and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly populous , dancing state , had been occasionally used as such ; —but such brilliant days had long passed away , and now the highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established among the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place . he was immediately interested . its character as a ball-room caught him ; and instead of passing on , he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed windows which were open , to look in and contemplate its capabilities , and lament that its original purpose should have ceased . he saw no fault in the room , he would acknowledge none which they suggested . no , it was long enough , broad enough , handsome enough . it would hold the very number for comfort . they ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through the winter . why had not miss woodhouse revived the former good old days of the room ? —she who could do any thing in highbury ! the want of proper families in the place , and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend , were mentioned ; but he was not satisfied . he could not be persuaded that so many good-looking houses as he saw around him , could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting ; and even when particulars were given and families described , he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing , or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body ’ s returning into their proper place the next morning . he argued like a young man very much bent on dancing ; and emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of the weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the churchills . he seemed to have all the life and spirit , cheerful feelings , and social inclinations of his father , and nothing of the pride or reserve of enscombe . of pride , indeed , there was , perhaps , scarcely enough ; his indifference to a confusion of rank , bordered too much on inelegance of mind . he could be no judge , however , of the evil he was holding cheap . it was but an effusion of lively spirits .
austen	emma	your obliged and affectionate son , f. c. weston churchill . chapter xv this letter must make its way to emma ’ s feelings . she was obliged , in spite of her previous determination to the contrary , to do it all the justice that mrs. weston foretold . as soon as she came to her own name , it was irresistible ; every line relating to herself was interesting , and almost every line agreeable ; and when this charm ceased , the subject could still maintain itself , by the natural return of her former regard for the writer , and the very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at that moment . she never stopt till she had gone through the whole ; and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong , yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed—and he had suffered , and was very sorry—and he was so grateful to mrs. weston , and so much in love with miss fairfax , and she was so happy herself , that there was no being severe ; and could he have entered the room , she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever .
austen	emma	may its approval beam in that soft eye ! harriet exactly . soft is the very word for her eye—of all epithets , the justest that could be given . thy ready wit the word will soon supply .
austen	emma	he had frightened her a little about mr. elton ; but when she considered that mr. knightley could not have observed him as she had done , neither with the interest , nor ( she must be allowed to tell herself , in spite of mr. knightley ’ s pretensions ) with the skill of such an observer on such a question as herself , that he had spoken it hastily and in anger , she was able to believe , that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be true , than what he knew any thing about . he certainly might have heard mr. elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done , and mr. elton might not be of an imprudent , inconsiderate disposition as to money matters ; he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them ; but then , mr. knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives . mr. knightley saw no such passion , and of course thought nothing of its effects ; but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest ; and more than a reasonable , becoming degree of prudence , she was very sure did not belong to mr. elton .
austen	emma	there she was welcomed , with the utmost delight , by her father , who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from vicarage lane—turning a corner which he could never bear to think of—and in strange hands—a mere common coachman—no james ; and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well : for mr. john knightley , ashamed of his ill-humour , was now all kindness and attention ; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father , as to seem—if not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruel—perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome ; and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party , except herself.—but her mind had never been in such perturbation ; and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection .
austen	emma	mrs. weston was looking so ill , and had an air of so much perturbation , that emma ’ s uneasiness increased ; and the moment they were alone , she eagerly said , “ what is it my dear friend ? something of a very unpleasant nature , i find , has occurred ; —do let me know directly what it is . i have been walking all this way in complete suspense . we both abhor suspense . do not let mine continue longer . it will do you good to speak of your distress , whatever it may be . ”
austen	emma	“ very well . if the westons think it worth while to be at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment , i have nothing to say against it , but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.—oh ! yes , i must be there ; i could not refuse ; and i will keep as much awake as i can ; but i would rather be at home , looking over william larkins ’ s week ’ s account ; much rather , i confess.—pleasure in seeing dancing ! —not i , indeed—i never look at it—i do not know who does.—fine dancing , i believe , like virtue , must be its own reward . those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very different . ”
austen	emma	“ dear me ! —how should i ever have borne it ! it would have killed me never to come to hartfield any more ! ” “ dear affectionate creature ! —_you_ banished to abbey-mill farm ! —_you_ confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life ! i wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it . he must have a pretty good opinion of himself . ”
austen	emma	she knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit ; she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable , and could accompany her own voice well . one accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by surprize—a second , slightly but correctly taken by frank churchill . her pardon was duly begged at the close of the song , and every thing usual followed . he was accused of having a delightful voice , and a perfect knowledge of music ; which was properly denied ; and that he knew nothing of the matter , and had no voice at all , roundly asserted . they sang together once more ; and emma would then resign her place to miss fairfax , whose performance , both vocal and instrumental , she never could attempt to conceal from herself , was infinitely superior to her own .
austen	emma	“ do not you think , miss woodhouse , our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered ? —do not you think her cure does perry the highest credit ? — ( here was a side-glance of great meaning at jane . ) upon my word , perry has restored her in a wonderful short time ! —oh ! if you had seen her , as i did , when she was at the worst ! ” —and when mrs. bates was saying something to emma , whispered farther , “ we do not say a word of any _assistance_ that perry might have ; not a word of a certain young physician from windsor.—oh ! no ; perry shall have all the credit . ”
austen	emma	“ yes , oh ! yes ” —he replied ; “ i was just going to mention it . a very successful visit : —i saw all the three ladies ; and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint . if the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize , it must have been the death of me . as it was , i was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit . ten minutes would have been all that was necessary , perhaps all that was proper ; and i had told my father i should certainly be at home before him—but there was no getting away , no pause ; and , to my utter astonishment , i found , when he ( finding me nowhere else ) joined me there at last , that i had been actually sitting with them very nearly three-quarters of an hour . the good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before . ”
austen	emma	“ he did . i was there—one of the party. ” “ were you really ? —well ! —but you observed nothing of course , for it seems to be a new idea to you.—if i had been there , i think i should have made some discoveries . ”
austen	emma	emma was in no danger of forgetting . it was a commission to touch every favourite feeling . would not harriet be the very creature described ? hazle eyes excepted , two years more might make her all that he wished . he might even have harriet in his thoughts at the moment ; who could say ? referring the education to her seemed to imply it .
austen	emma	“ robert martin has no great loss—if he can but think so ; and i hope it will not be long before he does . your views for harriet are best known to yourself ; but as you make no secret of your love of match-making , it is fair to suppose that views , and plans , and projects you have ; —and as a friend i shall just hint to you that if elton is the man , i think it will be all labour in vain . ”
austen	emma	he stopped.—emma dared not attempt any immediate reply . to speak , she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness . she must wait a moment , or he would think her mad . her silence disturbed him ; and after observing her a little while , he added ,
austen	emma	harriet did think him all perfection , and maintained the non-existence of any body equal to him in person or goodness—and did , in truth , prove herself more resolutely in love than emma had foreseen ; but yet it appeared to her so natural , so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort _unrequited_ , that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force .
austen	emma	they walked off , followed in half a minute by mr. knightley . mr. weston , his son , emma , and harriet , only remained ; and the young man ’ s spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant . even emma grew tired at last of flattery and merriment , and wished herself rather walking quietly about with any of the others , or sitting almost alone , and quite unattended to , in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her . the appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight ; and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart , and the solicitude of mrs. elton to have _her_ carriage first , were gladly endured , in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure . such another scheme , composed of so many ill-assorted people , she hoped never to be betrayed into again .
austen	emma	emma had no opportunity of speaking to mr. knightley till after supper ; but , when they were all in the ballroom again , her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked . he was warm in his reprobation of mr. elton ’ s conduct ; it had been unpardonable rudeness ; and mrs. elton ’ s looks also received the due share of censure .
austen	emma	“ but you , who are so extremely fond of it—there can be no danger , surely ? ” “ i should hope not ; but really when i look around among my acquaintance , i tremble . selina has entirely given up music—never touches the instrument—though she played sweetly . and the same may be said of mrs. jeffereys—clara partridge , that was—and of the two milmans , now mrs. bird and mrs. james cooper ; and of more than i can enumerate . upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright . i used to be quite angry with selina ; but really i begin now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her attention . i believe i was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper . ”
austen	emma	“ from the very circumstance of its being larger , sir . we shall have no occasion to open the windows at all—not once the whole evening ; and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows , letting in cold air upon heated bodies , which ( as you well know , sir ) does the mischief . ”
austen	emma	mr. and mrs. elton appeared ; and all the smiles and the proprieties passed . “ but miss bates and miss fairfax ! ” said mr. weston , looking about . “ we thought you were to bring them . ”
austen	emma	“ did you ever have your likeness taken , harriet ? ” said she : “ did you ever sit for your picture ? ” harriet was on the point of leaving the room , and only stopt to say , with a very interesting naïveté ,
austen	emma	harriet was standing at one of the windows . emma turned round to look at her in consternation , and hastily said , “ have you any idea of mr. knightley ’ s returning your affection ? ”
austen	emma	it was done however . this gallant young man , who seemed to love without feeling , and to recommend himself without complaisance , directly handed over the word to miss fairfax , and with a particular degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it . mr. knightley ’ s excessive curiosity to know what this word might be , made him seize every possible moment for darting his eye towards it , and it was not long before he saw it to be _dixon_ . jane fairfax ’ s perception seemed to accompany his ; her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning , the superior intelligence , of those five letters so arranged . she was evidently displeased ; looked up , and seeing herself watched , blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her , and saying only , “ i did not know that proper names were allowed , ” pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit , and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered . her face was averted from those who had made the attack , and turned towards her aunt .
austen	emma	“ there is so pointed , and so particular a meaning in this compliment , ” said she , “ that i can not have a doubt as to mr. elton ’ s intentions . you are his object—and you will soon receive the completest proof of it . i thought it must be so . i thought i could not be so deceived ; but now , it is clear ; the state of his mind is as clear and decided , as my wishes on the subject have been ever since i knew you . yes , harriet , just so long have i been wanting the very circumstance to happen that has happened . i could never tell whether an attachment between you and mr. elton were most desirable or most natural . its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each other ! i am very happy . i congratulate you , my dear harriet , with all my heart . this is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating . this is a connexion which offers nothing but good . it will give you every thing that you want—consideration , independence , a proper home—it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends , close to hartfield and to me , and confirm our intimacy for ever . this , harriet , is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us . ”
austen	emma	“ oh ! miss woodhouse , what a pity that i must not write this beautiful charade into my book ! i am sure i have not got one half so good. ” “ leave out the two last lines , and there is no reason why you should not write it into your book . ”
austen	emma	jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold . “ oh ! do not tell _me_ . you really are a very sad girl , and do not know how to take care of yourself.—to the post-office indeed ! mrs. weston , did you ever hear the like ? you and i must positively exert our authority . ”
austen	emma	“ well , ” said emma , willing to let it pass— “ you want to hear about the wedding ; and i shall be happy to tell you , for we all behaved charmingly . every body was punctual , every body in their best looks : not a tear , and hardly a long face to be seen . oh no ; we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart , and were sure of meeting every day . ”
austen	emma	emma was sorry ; —to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months ! —to be always doing more than she wished , and less than she ought ! why she did not like jane fairfax might be a difficult question to answer ; mr. knightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman , which she wanted to be thought herself ; and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time , there were moments of self-examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her . but “ she could never get acquainted with her : she did not know how it was , but there was such coldness and reserve—such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not—and then , her aunt was such an eternal talker ! —and she was made such a fuss with by every body ! —and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate—because their ages were the same , every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other. ” these were her reasons—she had no better .
austen	emma	“ your gallantry is really unanswerable . but ( lowering her voice ) —nobody speaks except ourselves , and it is rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people. ” “ i say nothing of which i am ashamed , ” replied he , with lively impudence . “ i saw you first in february . let every body on the hill hear me if they can . let my accents swell to mickleham on one side , and dorking on the other . i saw you first in february. ” and then whispering— “ our companions are excessively stupid . what shall we do to rouse them ? any nonsense will serve . they _shall_ talk . ladies and gentlemen , i am ordered by miss woodhouse ( who , wherever she is , presides ) to say , that she desires to know what you are all thinking of ? ”
austen	emma	“ ah ! but jane fairfax has them both , harriet. ” “ are you sure ? i saw she had execution , but i did not know she had any taste . nobody talked about it . and i hate italian singing.—there is no understanding a word of it . besides , if she does play so very well , you know , it is no more than she is obliged to do , because she will have to teach . the coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family . how did you think the coxes looked ? ”
austen	emma	“ i admired your resolution very much , sir , ” said he , “ in venturing out in such weather , for of course you saw there would be snow very soon . every body must have seen the snow coming on . i admired your spirit ; and i dare say we shall get home very well . another hour or two ’ s snow can hardly make the road impassable ; and we are two carriages ; if one is blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other at hand . i dare say we shall be all safe at hartfield before midnight . ”
austen	emma	“ i declare , i do not know when i have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction ! —it always has quite hurt me that jane fairfax , who plays so delightfully , should not have an instrument . it seemed quite a shame , especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away . this is like giving ourselves a slap , to be sure ! and it was but yesterday i was telling mr. cole , i really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing-room , while i do not know one note from another , and our little girls , who are but just beginning , perhaps may never make any thing of it ; and there is poor jane fairfax , who is mistress of music , has not any thing of the nature of an instrument , not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world , to amuse herself with.—i was saying this to mr. cole but yesterday , and he quite agreed with me ; only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase , hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can ; and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought—or else i am sure we ought to be ashamed of it.—we are in great hopes that miss woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening . ”
austen	emma	“ emma knows i never flatter her , ” said mr. knightley , “ but i meant no reflection on any body . miss taylor has been used to have two persons to please ; she will now have but one . the chances are that she must be a gainer . ”
austen	emma	“ one ought to be at enscombe , and know the ways of the family , before one decides upon what he can do , ” replied mrs. weston . “ one ought to use the same caution , perhaps , in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family ; but enscombe , i believe , certainly must not be judged by general rules : _she_ is so very unreasonable ; and every thing gives way to her . ”
austen	emma	her cheeks flushed at the name , and she felt afraid of something , though she knew not what . “ have you heard from her yourself this morning ? ” cried he . “ you have , i believe , and know the whole . ”
austen	emma	“ you can not do better , sir. ” “ i would ask for the pleasure of your company , mr. knightley , but i am a very slow walker , and my pace would be tedious to you ; and , besides , you have another long walk before you , to donwell abbey . ”
austen	emma	“ ever since the day—about four years ago—that miss taylor and i met with him in broadway lane , when , because it began to drizzle , he darted away with so much gallantry , and borrowed two umbrellas for us from farmer mitchell ’ s , i made up my mind on the subject . i planned the match from that hour ; and when such success has blessed me in this instance , dear papa , you can not think that i shall leave off match-making . ”
austen	emma	“ something that would do ! ” repeated mrs. elton . “ aye , _that_ may suit your humble ideas of yourself ; —i know what a modest creature you are ; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer , any inferior , commonplace situation , in a family not moving in a certain circle , or able to command the elegancies of life . ”
austen	emma	emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared ; but if this reflected at all upon his impatience , his sorrowful look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him . he felt the going away almost too much to speak of it . his dejection was most evident . he sat really lost in thought for the first few minutes ; and when rousing himself , it was only to say ,
austen	emma	she thought so well of the letter , that when mr. knightley came again , she desired him to read it . she was sure of mrs. weston ’ s wishing it to be communicated ; especially to one , who , like mr. knightley , had seen so much to blame in his conduct .
austen	emma	“ especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful , troublesome creature ! ” said emma playfully . “ that is what you have in your head , i know—and what you would certainly say if my father were not by . ”
austen	emma	emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment . the dread of being awakened from the happiest dream , was perhaps the most prominent feeling . “ i can not make speeches , emma : ” he soon resumed ; and in a tone of such sincere , decided , intelligible tenderness as was tolerably convincing.— “ if i loved you less , i might be able to talk about it more . but you know what i am.—you hear nothing but truth from me.—i have blamed you , and lectured you , and you have borne it as no other woman in england would have borne it.—bear with the truths i would tell you now , dearest emma , as well as you have borne with them . the manner , perhaps , may have as little to recommend them . god knows , i have been a very indifferent lover.—but you understand me.—yes , you see , you understand my feelings—and will return them if you can . at present , i ask only to hear , once to hear your voice . ”
austen	emma	“ that has been a good deal the case , my dear ; but not to the degree you mention . perry says that colds have been very general , but not so heavy as he has very often known them in november . perry does not call it altogether a sickly season . ”
austen	emma	a glance or two between him and his wife , convinced him that all was as right as this speech proclaimed ; and its happy effect on his spirits was immediate . his air and voice recovered their usual briskness : he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand , and entered on the subject in a manner to prove , that he now only wanted time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing . his companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence , or smooth objections ; and by the time they had talked it all over together , and he had talked it all over again with emma , in their walk back to hartfield , he was become perfectly reconciled , and not far from thinking it the very best thing that frank could possibly have done .
austen	emma	“ very true , ” he gravely replied ; “ it was very bad. ” but still he went on measuring , and still he ended with , “ i think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple . ”
austen	emma	the confession completely renewed her first shame—and the sight of harriet ’ s tears made her think that she should never be in charity with herself again . harriet bore the intelligence very well—blaming nobody—and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of herself , as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend .
austen	emma	“ if you are very kind , ” said he , “ it will be one of the waltzes we danced last night ; —let me live them over again . you did not enjoy them as i did ; you appeared tired the whole time . i believe you were glad we danced no longer ; but i would have given worlds—all the worlds one ever has to give—for another half-hour . ”
austen	emma	“ you are quite in the right ; it was most natural to pay your visit , then ” — he was silent . she believed he was looking at her ; probably reflecting on what she had said , and trying to understand the manner . she heard him sigh . it was natural for him to feel that he had _cause_ to sigh . he could not believe her to be encouraging him . a few awkward moments passed , and he sat down again ; and in a more determined manner said ,
austen	emma	“ i shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn , instead of coming here. ” “ but why should you be sorry , sir ? —i assure you , it did the children a great deal of good . ”
austen	emma	they now walked on together quietly , till within view of the vicarage pales , when a sudden resolution , of at least getting harriet into the house , made her again find something very much amiss about her boot , and fall behind to arrange it once more . she then broke the lace off short , and dexterously throwing it into a ditch , was presently obliged to entreat them to stop , and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort .
austen	emma	enscombe however was gracious , gracious in fact , if not in word . his wish of staying longer evidently did not please ; but it was not opposed . all was safe and prosperous ; and as the removal of one solicitude generally makes way for another , emma , being now certain of her ball , began to adopt as the next vexation mr. knightley ’ s provoking indifference about it . either because he did not dance himself , or because the plan had been formed without his being consulted , he seemed resolved that it should not interest him , determined against its exciting any present curiosity , or affording him any future amusement . to her voluntary communications emma could get no more approving reply , than ,
austen	emma	“ indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced . your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely . at first , while i supposed you satisfied that colonel campbell was the giver , i saw it only as paternal kindness , and thought it the most natural thing in the world . but when you mentioned mrs. dixon , i felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship . and now i can see it in no other light than as an offering of love . ”
austen	emma	this was the conclusion of the first series of reflection . this was the knowledge of herself , on the first question of inquiry , which she reached ; and without being long in reaching it.—she was most sorrowfully indignant ; ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed to her—her affection for mr. knightley.—every other part of her mind was disgusting .
austen	emma	“ i have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you , miss woodhouse , ” she shortly afterwards began , “ since the party to box hill . very pleasant party . but yet i think there was something wanting . things did not seem—that is , there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some.—so it appeared to me at least , but i might be mistaken . however , i think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again . what say you both to our collecting the same party , and exploring to box hill again , while the fine weather lasts ? —it must be the same party , you know , quite the same party , not _one_ exception . ”
austen	emma	a young lady who faints , must be recovered ; questions must be answered , and surprizes be explained . such events are very interesting , but the suspense of them can not last long . a few minutes made emma acquainted with the whole .
austen	emma	in this state frank churchill had found her , she trembling and conditioning , they loud and insolent . by a most fortunate chance his leaving highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance at this critical moment . the pleasantness of the morning had induced him to walk forward , and leave his horses to meet him by another road , a mile or two beyond highbury—and happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before of miss bates , and to have forgotten to restore them , he had been obliged to stop at her door , and go in for a few minutes : he was therefore later than he had intended ; and being on foot , was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them . the terror which the woman and boy had been creating in harriet was then their own portion . he had left them completely frightened ; and harriet eagerly clinging to him , and hardly able to speak , had just strength enough to reach hartfield , before her spirits were quite overcome . it was his idea to bring her to hartfield : he had thought of no other place .
austen	emma	“ there is no charm equal to tenderness of heart , ” said she afterwards to herself . “ there is nothing to be compared to it . warmth and tenderness of heart , with an affectionate , open manner , will beat all the clearness of head in the world , for attraction , i am sure it will . it is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved—which gives isabella all her popularity.—i have it not—but i know how to prize and respect it.—harriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives . dear harriet ! —i would not change you for the clearest-headed , longest-sighted , best-judging female breathing . oh ! the coldness of a jane fairfax ! —harriet is worth a hundred such—and for a wife—a sensible man ’ s wife—it is invaluable . i mention no names ; but happy the man who changes emma for harriet ! ”
austen	emma	“ oh ! no—i am grieved to find—i was on the point of telling you that when i called at mrs. goddard ’ s door , which i did the very last thing before i returned to dress , i was told that miss smith was not better , by no means better , rather worse . very much grieved and concerned—i had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as i knew had been given her in the morning . ”
austen	emma	“ there is no necessity for my calling this morning , ” said the young man ; “ another day would do as well ; but there was that degree of acquaintance at weymouth which— ” “ oh ! go to-day , go to-day . do not defer it . what is right to be done can not be done too soon . and , besides , i must give you a hint , frank ; any want of attention to her _here_ should be carefully avoided . you saw her with the campbells , when she was the equal of every body she mixed with , but here she is with a poor old grandmother , who has barely enough to live on . if you do not call early it will be a slight . ”
austen	emma	could she but have given harriet her feelings about it all ! she had talked her into love ; but , alas ! she was not so easily to be talked out of it . the charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of harriet ’ s mind was not to be talked away . he might be superseded by another ; he certainly would indeed ; nothing could be clearer ; even a robert martin would have been sufficient ; but nothing else , she feared , would cure her . harriet was one of those , who , having once begun , would be always in love . and now , poor girl ! she was considerably worse from this reappearance of mr. elton . she was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other . emma saw him only once ; but two or three times every day harriet was sure _just_ to meet with him , or _just_ to miss him , _just_ to hear his voice , or see his shoulder , _just_ to have something occur to preserve him in her fancy , in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture . she was , moreover , perpetually hearing about him ; for , excepting when at hartfield , she was always among those who saw no fault in mr. elton , and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns ; and every report , therefore , every guess—all that had already occurred , all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs , comprehending income , servants , and furniture , was continually in agitation around her . her regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him , and her regrets kept alive , and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of miss hawkins ’ s happiness , and continual observation of , how much he seemed attached ! —his air as he walked by the house—the very sitting of his hat , being all in proof of how much he was in love !
austen	emma	the bitter feelings occasioned by this speech , the many bitter feelings , made the utmost exertion necessary on emma ’ s side , to enable her to say on reply , “ harriet , i will only venture to declare , that mr. knightley is the last man in the world , who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does . ”
austen	emma	the following day brought news from richmond to throw every thing else into the background . an express arrived at randalls to announce the death of mrs. churchill ! though her nephew had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account , she had not lived above six-and-thirty hours after his return . a sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded by her general state , had carried her off after a short struggle . the great mrs. churchill was no more .
austen	emma	the course of true love never did run smooth— a hartfield edition of shakespeare would have a long note on that passage. ” “ that mr. elton should really be in love with me , —me , of all people , who did not know him , to speak to him , at michaelmas ! and he , the very handsomest man that ever was , and a man that every body looks up to , quite like mr. knightley ! his company so sought after , that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it ; that he has more invitations than there are days in the week . and so excellent in the church ! miss nash has put down all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to highbury . dear me ! when i look back to the first time i saw him ! how little did i think ! —the two abbots and i ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by , and miss nash came and scolded us away , and staid to look through herself ; however , she called me back presently , and let me look too , which was very good-natured . and how beautiful we thought he looked ! he was arm-in-arm with mr. cole . ”
austen	emma	they arrived , the carriage turned , the step was let down , and mr. elton , spruce , black , and smiling , was with them instantly . emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject . mr. elton was all obligation and cheerfulness ; he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed , that she began to think he must have received a different account of harriet from what had reached her . she had sent while dressing , and the answer had been , “ much the same—not better . ”
austen	emma	harriet smiled again , and her smiles grew stronger . chapter viii harriet slept at hartfield that night . for some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there , and gradually getting to have a bed-room appropriated to herself ; and emma judged it best in every respect , safest and kindest , to keep her with them as much as possible just at present . she was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to mrs. goddard ’ s , but it was then to be settled that she should return to hartfield , to make a regular visit of some days .
austen	emma	“ what two letters ! —express perfection ! i am sure i do not know. ” “ ah ! you will never guess . you , ( to emma ) , i am certain , will never guess.—i will tell you.—m . and a.—em-ma.—do you understand ? ”
austen	emma	but when satisfied on all these points , and their acquaintance proportionably advanced , he contrived to find an opportunity , while their two fathers were engaged with each other , of introducing his mother-in-law , and speaking of her with so much handsome praise , so much warm admiration , so much gratitude for the happiness she secured to his father , and her very kind reception of himself , as was an additional proof of his knowing how to please—and of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her . he did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by mrs. weston ; but , undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter . he understood what would be welcome ; he could be sure of little else . “ his father ’ s marriage , ” he said , “ had been the wisest measure , every friend must rejoice in it ; and the family from whom he had received such a blessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on him . ”
austen	emma	“ don ’ t say i was cross . i was fatigued . the heat overcame me. ” “ it is hotter to-day. ” “ not to my feelings . i am perfectly comfortable to-day. ” “ you are comfortable because you are under command . ”
austen	emma	“ what ! are we to have the pleasure of a call from mr. elton ? —that will be a favour indeed ! for i know gentlemen do not like morning visits , and mr. elton ’ s time is so engaged . ”
austen	emma	mr. weston had accompanied her to mrs. bates ’ s , and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely ; but she having then induced miss fairfax to join her in an airing , was now returned with much more to say , and much more to say with satisfaction , than a quarter of an hour spent in mrs. bates ’ s parlour , with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings , could have afforded .
austen	emma	the mistake had been slight . the carriage was sent for them now . emma longed to know what frank ’ s first opinion of mrs. elton might be ; how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress , and her smiles of graciousness . he was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion , by giving her very proper attention , after the introduction had passed .
austen	emma	“ i wish you may not get into a scrape , harriet , whenever he does marry ; —i mean , as to being acquainted with his wife—for though his sisters , from a superior education , are not to be altogether objected to , it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice . the misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates . there can be no doubt of your being a gentleman ’ s daughter , and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power , or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you . ”
austen	emma	to take a dislike to a young man , only because he appeared to be of a different disposition from himself , was unworthy the real liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him ; for with all the high opinion of himself , which she had often laid to his charge , she had never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the merit of another .
austen	emma	“ this is very true , ” said she , “ at least as far as relates to me , which was all that was meant—and it is very shameful.—of the same age—and always knowing her—i ought to have been more her friend.—she will never like me now . i have neglected her too long . but i will shew her greater attention than i have done . ”
austen	emma	the rest of the party were now returning , and all were soon collected . with some there was great joy at the sight of frank churchill ; others took it very composedly ; but there was a very general distress and disturbance on miss fairfax ’ s disappearance being explained . that it was time for every body to go , concluded the subject ; and with a short final arrangement for the next day ’ s scheme , they parted . frank churchill ’ s little inclination to exclude himself increased so much , that his last words to emma were ,
austen	emma	“ yes , i have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him. ” “ i am afraid , ” returned emma , sighing , “ that i must often have contributed to make her unhappy. ” “ on your side , my love , it was very innocently done . but she probably had something of that in her thoughts , when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before . one natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in , ” she said , “ was that of making her _unreasonable_ . the consciousness of having done amiss , had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes , and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been—that had been—hard for him to bear . ‘ i did not make the allowances , ’ said she , ‘ which i ought to have done , for his temper and spirits—his delightful spirits , and that gaiety , that playfulness of disposition , which , under any other circumstances , would , i am sure , have been as constantly bewitching to me , as they were at first. ’ she then began to speak of you , and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness ; and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected , desired me , whenever i had an opportunity , to thank you—i could not thank you too much—for every wish and every endeavour to do her good . she was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself . ”
austen	emma	“ my dear jane , say no more about it . the thing is determined , that is ( laughing affectedly ) as far as i can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master . you know , mrs. weston , you and i must be cautious how we express ourselves . but i do flatter myself , my dear jane , that my influence is not entirely worn out . if i meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore , consider that point as settled . ”
austen	emma	the very next day however produced some proof of inspiration . he called for a few moments , just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing , as he said , a charade , which a friend of his had addressed to a young lady , the object of his admiration , but which , from his manner , emma was immediately convinced must be his own .
austen	emma	emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure ; and fully assented to his proposition of mr. frank churchill and miss smith making their party quite complete . “ he has been wanting to come to us , ” continued mr. weston , “ ever since september : every letter has been full of it ; but he can not command his own time . he has those to please who must be pleased , and who ( between ourselves ) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices . but now i have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in january . ”
austen	emma	“ the clerks grow expert from habit.—they must begin with some quickness of sight and hand , and exercise improves them . if you want any farther explanation , ” continued he , smiling , “ they are paid for it . that is the key to a great deal of capacity . the public pays and must be served well . ”
austen	emma	perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her inferior in talent , and all the elegancies of mind . the very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it ; but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior . he must know that the woodhouses had been settled for several generations at hartfield , the younger branch of a very ancient family—and that the eltons were nobody . the landed property of hartfield certainly was inconsiderable , being but a sort of notch in the donwell abbey estate , to which all the rest of highbury belonged ; but their fortune , from other sources , was such as to make them scarcely secondary to donwell abbey itself , in every other kind of consequence ; and the woodhouses had long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which mr. elton had first entered not two years ago , to make his way as he could , without any alliances but in trade , or any thing to recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility.—but he had fancied her in love with him ; that evidently must have been his dependence ; and after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head , emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging , so full of courtesy and attention , as ( supposing her real motive unperceived ) might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy , like mr. elton , in fancying himself a very decided favourite . if _she_ had so misinterpreted his feelings , she had little right to wonder that _he_ , with self-interest to blind him , should have mistaken hers .
austen	emma	“ she meant to be impertinently curious , just as such an anne cox should be. ” “ she said he was very agreeable the day he dined there . he sat by her at dinner . miss nash thinks either of the coxes would be very glad to marry him . ”
austen	emma	“ i have always thought it a very foolish intimacy , ” said mr. knightley presently , “ though i have kept my thoughts to myself ; but i now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for harriet . you will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty , and of what she has a claim to , that , in a little while , nobody within her reach will be good enough for her . vanity working on a weak head , produces every sort of mischief . nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high . miss harriet smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast , though she is a very pretty girl . men of sense , whatever you may chuse to say , do not want silly wives . men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity—and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in , when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed . let her marry robert martin , and she is safe , respectable , and happy for ever ; but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly , and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune , she may be a parlour-boarder at mrs. goddard ’ s all the rest of her life—or , at least , ( for harriet smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other , ) till she grow desperate , and is glad to catch at the old writing-master ’ s son . ”
austen	emma	“ no—i shall not stir . i shall sit by you . you are my best cure. ” “ we are going to box hill to-morrow ; —you will join us . it is not swisserland , but it will be something for a young man so much in want of a change . you will stay , and go with us ? ”
austen	emma	alas ! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with mr. knightley . two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over-throw of every thing . a letter arrived from mr. churchill to urge his nephew ’ s instant return . mrs. churchill was unwell—far too unwell to do without him ; she had been in a very suffering state ( so said her husband ) when writing to her nephew two days before , though from her usual unwillingness to give pain , and constant habit of never thinking of herself , she had not mentioned it ; but now she was too ill to trifle , and must entreat him to set off for enscombe without delay .
austen	emma	the picture ! —how eager he had been about the picture ! —and the charade ! —and an hundred other circumstances ; —how clearly they had seemed to point at harriet . to be sure , the charade , with its “ ready wit ” —but then the “ soft eyes ” —in fact it suited neither ; it was a jumble without taste or truth . who could have seen through such thick-headed nonsense ?
austen	emma	chapter vi emma could not feel a doubt of having given harriet ’ s fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose , for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of mr. elton ’ s being a remarkably handsome man , with most agreeable manners ; and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints , she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on harriet ’ s side , as there could be any occasion for . she was quite convinced of mr. elton ’ s being in the fairest way of falling in love , if not in love already . she had no scruple with regard to him . he talked of harriet , and praised her so warmly , that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add . his perception of the striking improvement of harriet ’ s manner , since her introduction at hartfield , was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment .
austen	emma	“ and if the dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must conclude it to come from the campbells. ” “ no , i am sure it is not from the campbells . miss fairfax knows it is not from the campbells , or they would have been guessed at first . she would not have been puzzled , had she dared fix on them . i may not have convinced you perhaps , but i am perfectly convinced myself that mr. dixon is a principal in the business . ”
austen	emma	“ yes , ” he replied , “ any body may know how highly i think of her. ” “ and yet , ” said emma , beginning hastily and with an arch look , but soon stopping—it was better , however , to know the worst at once—she hurried on— “ and yet , perhaps , you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is . the extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other . ”
austen	emma	“ my dear emma , as long as he thinks so , it is so ; but if he really loves jane fairfax— ” “ nonsense ! he does not care about jane fairfax . in the way of love , i am sure he does not . he would do any good to her , or her family ; but— ”
austen	emma	“ what do you say to mrs. dixon ? ” “ mrs . dixon ! very true indeed . i had not thought of mrs. dixon . she must know as well as her father , how acceptable an instrument would be ; and perhaps the mode of it , the mystery , the surprize , is more like a young woman ’ s scheme than an elderly man ’ s . it is mrs. dixon , i dare say . i told you that your suspicions would guide mine . ”
austen	emma	mr. knightley and harriet smith ! —it was a union to distance every wonder of the kind.—the attachment of frank churchill and jane fairfax became commonplace , threadbare , stale in the comparison , exciting no surprize , presenting no disparity , affording nothing to be said or thought.—mr . knightley and harriet smith ! —such an elevation on her side ! such a debasement on his ! it was horrible to emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion , to foresee the smiles , the sneers , the merriment it would prompt at his expense ; the mortification and disdain of his brother , the thousand inconveniences to himself.—could it be ? —no ; it was impossible . and yet it was far , very far , from impossible.—was it a new circumstance for a man of first-rate abilities to be captivated by very inferior powers ? was it new for one , perhaps too busy to seek , to be the prize of a girl who would seek him ? —was it new for any thing in this world to be unequal , inconsistent , incongruous—or for chance and circumstance ( as second causes ) to direct the human fate ?
austen	emma	“ you mistake me , you quite mistake me , ” she replied , exerting herself . “ it is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy , but i can not believe it . it seems an impossibility ! —you can not mean to say , that harriet smith has accepted robert martin . you can not mean that he has even proposed to her again—yet . you only mean , that he intends it . ”
austen	emma	“ how much i am obliged to you , ” said he , “ for telling me to come to-day ! —if it had not been for you , i should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party . i had quite determined to go away again . ”
austen	emma	“ no , ” cried mr. knightley , “ that need not be the consequence . let them be sent to donwell . i shall certainly be at leisure. ” “ upon my word , ” exclaimed emma , “ you amuse me ! i should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party ; and why i am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys . these amazing engagements of mine—what have they been ? dining once with the coles—and having a ball talked of , which never took place . i can understand you— ( nodding at mr. john knightley ) —your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here , delights you too much to pass unnoticed . but you , ( turning to mr. knightley , ) who know how very , very seldom i am ever two hours from hartfield , why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me , i can not imagine . and as to my dear little boys , i must say , that if aunt emma has not time for them , i do not think they would fare much better with uncle knightley , who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one—and who , when he is at home , is either reading to himself or settling his accounts . ”
austen	emma	chapter xvii when the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner , emma found it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties ; —with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did mrs. elton engross jane fairfax and slight herself . she and mrs. weston were obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together . mrs. elton left them no choice . if jane repressed her for a little time , she soon began again ; and though much that passed between them was in a half-whisper , especially on mrs. elton ’ s side , there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects : the post-office—catching cold—fetching letters—and friendship , were long under discussion ; and to them succeeded one , which must be at least equally unpleasant to jane—inquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to suit her , and professions of mrs. elton ’ s meditated activity .
austen	emma	at last jane began , and though the first bars were feebly given , the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to . mrs. weston had been delighted before , and was delighted again ; emma joined her in all her praise ; and the pianoforte , with every proper discrimination , was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise .
austen	emma	emma even jumped with surprize ; —and , horror-struck , exclaimed , “ jane fairfax ! —good god ! you are not serious ? you do not mean it ? ” “ you may well be amazed , ” returned mrs. weston , still averting her eyes , and talking on with eagerness , that emma might have time to recover— “ you may well be amazed . but it is even so . there has been a solemn engagement between them ever since october—formed at weymouth , and kept a secret from every body . not a creature knowing it but themselves—neither the campbells , nor her family , nor his.—it is so wonderful , that though perfectly convinced of the fact , it is yet almost incredible to myself . i can hardly believe it.—i thought i knew him . ”
austen	emma	the news was universally a surprize wherever it spread ; and mr. weston had his five minutes share of it ; but five minutes were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind.—he saw the advantages of the match , and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife ; but the wonder of it was very soon nothing ; and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it .
austen	emma	chapter xviii mr. frank churchill did not come . when the time proposed drew near , mrs. weston ’ s fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse . for the present , he could not be spared , to his “ very great mortification and regret ; but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to randalls at no distant period . ”
austen	emma	“ excuse me , ” said jane earnestly , “ i can not by any means consent to such an arrangement , so needlessly troublesome to your servant . if the errand were not a pleasure to me , it could be done , as it always is when i am not here , by my grandmama ’ s . ”
austen	emma	“ you talk a great deal of the length of this passage , my dear . it is a mere nothing after all ; and not the least draught from the stairs. ” “ i wish , ” said mrs. weston , “ one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best . to do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object—if one could but tell what that would be . ”
austen	emma	there was no reason to suppose mr. elton thought at all differently from his wife . he seemed not merely happy with her , but proud . he had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to highbury , as not even miss woodhouse could equal ; and the greater part of her new acquaintance , disposed to commend , or not in the habit of judging , following the lead of miss bates ’ s good-will , or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed herself , were very well satisfied ; so that mrs. elton ’ s praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do , unimpeded by miss woodhouse , who readily continued her first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being “ very pleasant and very elegantly dressed . ”
austen	emma	how they were all to be conveyed , he would have made a difficulty if he could , but as his son and daughter ’ s carriage and horses were actually at hartfield , he was not able to make more than a simple question on that head ; it hardly amounted to a doubt ; nor did it occupy emma long to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for harriet also .
austen	emma	she then took a longer time for consideration . should she proceed no farther ? —should she let it pass , and seem to suspect nothing ? —perhaps harriet might think her cold or angry if she did ; or perhaps if she were totally silent , it might only drive harriet into asking her to hear too much ; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been , such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances , she was perfectly resolved.—she believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once , all that she meant to say and know . plain dealing was always best . she had previously determined how far she would proceed , on any application of the sort ; and it would be safer for both , to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed.—she was decided , and thus spoke—
austen	emma	“ then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love . but i do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do . mr. knightley does nothing mysteriously . ”
austen	emma	chapter xiii emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love . her ideas only varied as to the how much . at first , she thought it was a good deal ; and afterwards , but little . she had great pleasure in hearing frank churchill talked of ; and , for his sake , greater pleasure than ever in seeing mr. and mrs. weston ; she was very often thinking of him , and quite impatient for a letter , that she might know how he was , how were his spirits , how was his aunt , and what was the chance of his coming to randalls again this spring . but , on the other hand , she could not admit herself to be unhappy , nor , after the first morning , to be less disposed for employment than usual ; she was still busy and cheerful ; and , pleasing as he was , she could yet imagine him to have faults ; and farther , though thinking of him so much , and , as she sat drawing or working , forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment , fancying interesting dialogues , and inventing elegant letters ; the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she _refused_ _him_ . their affection was always to subside into friendship . every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting ; but still they were to part . when she became sensible of this , it struck her that she could not be very much in love ; for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father , never to marry , a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings .
austen	emma	chapter iv human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting situations , that a young person , who either marries or dies , is sure of being kindly spoken of .
austen	emma	there was a little hesitation in emma ’ s answer . “ oh ! yes—very—a very pleasing young woman. ” “ i think her beautiful , quite beautiful. ” “ very nicely dressed , indeed ; a remarkably elegant gown. ” “ i am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love . ”
austen	emma	miss bates would hardly give emma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to her ; but as without supposing it possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of mr. frank churchill ’ s going , she proceeded to give them all , it was of no consequence .
austen	emma	“ this is coming as you should do , ” said she ; “ like a gentleman.—i am quite glad to see you. ” he thanked her , observing , “ how lucky that we should arrive at the same moment ! for , if we had met first in the drawing-room , i doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.—you might not have distinguished how i came , by my look or manner . ”
austen	emma	now there would be pleasure in her returning—every thing would be a pleasure . it would be a great pleasure to know robert martin . high in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities , was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from mr. knightley would soon be over . the disguise , equivocation , mystery , so hateful to her to practise , might soon be over . she could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty .
austen	emma	“ ah ! miss woodhouse , how kind you are ! —i suppose you have heard—and are come to give us joy . this does not seem much like joy , indeed , in me— ( twinkling away a tear or two ) —but it will be very trying for us to part with her , after having had her so long , and she has a dreadful headache just now , writing all the morning : —such long letters , you know , to be written to colonel campbell , and mrs. dixon . ‘ my dear , ’ said i , ‘ you will blind yourself ’ —for tears were in her eyes perpetually . one can not wonder , one can not wonder . it is a great change ; and though she is amazingly fortunate—such a situation , i suppose , as no young woman before ever met with on first going out—do not think us ungrateful , miss woodhouse , for such surprising good fortune— ( again dispersing her tears ) —but , poor dear soul ! if you were to see what a headache she has . when one is in great pain , you know one can not feel any blessing quite as it may deserve . she is as low as possible . to look at her , nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such a situation . you will excuse her not coming to you—she is not able—she is gone into her own room—i want her to lie down upon the bed . ‘ my dear , ’ said i , ‘ i shall say you are laid down upon the bed : ’ but , however , she is not ; she is walking about the room . but , now that she has written her letters , she says she shall soon be well . she will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you , miss woodhouse , but your kindness will excuse her . you were kept waiting at the door—i was quite ashamed—but somehow there was a little bustle—for it so happened that we had not heard the knock , and till you were on the stairs , we did not know any body was coming . ‘ it is only mrs. cole , ’ said i , ‘ depend upon it . nobody else would come so early. ’ ‘ well , ’ said she , ‘ it must be borne some time or other , and it may as well be now. ’ but then patty came in , and said it was you . ‘ oh ! ’ said i , ‘ it is miss woodhouse : i am sure you will like to see her. ’ — ‘ i can see nobody , ’ said she ; and up she got , and would go away ; and that was what made us keep you waiting—and extremely sorry and ashamed we were . ‘ if you must go , my dear , ’ said i , ‘ you must , and i will say you are laid down upon the bed . ’ ”
austen	emma	“ oh ! you have found us out at last , have you , in our seclusion ? —i was this moment telling jane , i thought you would begin to be impatient for tidings of us . ”
austen	emma	a very few minutes more , however , completed the present trial . mr. weston , always alert when business was to be done , and as incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable , as of foreseeing any that was doubtful , said , “ it was time to go ; ” and the young man , though he might and did sigh , could not but agree , to take leave .
austen	emma	mrs. weston looked up , afraid to believe ; but emma ’ s countenance was as steady as her words . “ that you may have less difficulty in believing this boast , of my present perfect indifference , ” she continued , “ i will farther tell you , that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance , when i did like him , when i was very much disposed to be attached to him—nay , was attached—and how it came to cease , is perhaps the wonder . fortunately , however , it did cease . i have really for some time past , for at least these three months , cared nothing about him . you may believe me , mrs. weston . this is the simple truth . ”
austen	emma	harriet , tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word , was always very long at a purchase ; and while she was still hanging over muslins and changing her mind , emma went to the door for amusement.—much could not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of highbury ; —mr . perry walking hastily by , mr. william cox letting himself in at the office-door , mr. cole ’ s carriage-horses returning from exercise , or a stray letter-boy on an obstinate mule , were the liveliest objects she could presume to expect ; and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with his tray , a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full basket , two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone , and a string of dawdling children round the baker ’ s little bow-window eyeing the gingerbread , she knew she had no reason to complain , and was amused enough ; quite enough still to stand at the door . a mind lively and at ease , can do with seeing nothing , and can see nothing that does not answer .
austen	emma	this event had very lately taken place ; too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty ; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning . she had long resolved that one-and-twenty should be the period . with the fortitude of a devoted novitiate , she had resolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice , and retire from all the pleasures of life , of rational intercourse , equal society , peace and hope , to penance and mortification for ever .
austen	emma	emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault . “ well , ” said she , “ and you soon silenced mr. cole , i suppose ? ” “ yes , very soon . he gave me a quiet hint ; i told him he was mistaken ; he asked my pardon and said no more . cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours . ”
austen	emma	“ yes , papa ; we have something to read you , something quite fresh . a piece of paper was found on the table this morning— ( dropt , we suppose , by a fairy ) —containing a very pretty charade , and we have just copied it in . ”
austen	emma	frank churchill had danced once at highbury , and longed to dance again ; and the last half-hour of an evening which mr. woodhouse was persuaded to spend with his daughter at randalls , was passed by the two young people in schemes on the subject . frank ’ s was the first idea ; and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it ; for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties , and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance . but still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully mr. frank churchill and miss woodhouse danced—for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with jane fairfax—and even for simple dancing itself , without any of the wicked aids of vanity—to assist him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to hold—and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour , in the hope of discovering , in spite of all that mr. weston could say of their exactly equal size , that it was a little the largest .
austen	emma	emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent , which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving , to emulate the “ very true , my love , ” which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion ; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all . she could not be complying , she dreaded being quarrelsome ; her heroism reached only to silence . she allowed him to talk , and arranged the glasses , and wrapped herself up , without opening her lips .
austen	emma	“ not at all. ” “ you are ungrateful. ” “ ungrateful ! —what do you mean ? ” then changing from a frown to a smile— “ no , do not tell me—i do not want to know what you mean.—where is my father ? —when are we to begin dancing ? ”
austen	emma	“ my dear , how am i to get so far ? randalls is such a distance . i could not walk half so far. ” “ no , papa , nobody thought of your walking . we must go in the carriage , to be sure . ”
austen	emma	it was hot ; and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered , dispersed way , scarcely any three together , they insensibly followed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of limes , which stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the river , seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds.—it led to nothing ; nothing but a view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars , which seemed intended , in their erection , to give the appearance of an approach to the house , which never had been there . disputable , however , as might be the taste of such a termination , it was in itself a charming walk , and the view which closed it extremely pretty.—the considerable slope , at nearly the foot of which the abbey stood , gradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds ; and at half a mile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur , well clothed with wood ; —and at the bottom of this bank , favourably placed and sheltered , rose the abbey mill farm , with meadows in front , and the river making a close and handsome curve around it .
austen	emma	“ dear miss woodhouse ! ” —and “ dear miss woodhouse , ” was all that harriet , with many tender embraces could articulate at first ; but when they did arrive at something more like conversation , it was sufficiently clear to her friend that she saw , felt , anticipated , and remembered just as she ought . mr. elton ’ s superiority had very ample acknowledgment .
austen	emma	in this age of literature , such collections on a very grand scale are not uncommon . miss nash , head-teacher at mrs. goddard ’ s , had written out at least three hundred ; and harriet , who had taken the first hint of it from her , hoped , with miss woodhouse ’ s help , to get a great many more . emma assisted with her invention , memory and taste ; and as harriet wrote a very pretty hand , it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order , in form as well as quantity .
austen	emma	she went—she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door , but had not been into the house since the morning after box hill , when poor jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion , though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.—the fear of being still unwelcome , determined her , though assured of their being at home , to wait in the passage , and send up her name.—she heard patty announcing it ; but no such bustle succeeded as poor miss bates had before made so happily intelligible.—no ; she heard nothing but the instant reply of , “ beg her to walk up ; ” —and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by jane herself , coming eagerly forward , as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient.—emma had never seen her look so well , so lovely , so engaging . there was consciousness , animation , and warmth ; there was every thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted.— she came forward with an offered hand ; and said , in a low , but very feeling tone ,
austen	emma	“ you certainly will meet them if i can prevail ; and i shall call on miss bates in my way home. ” “ that ’ s quite unnecessary ; i see jane every day : —but as you like . it is to be a morning scheme , you know , knightley ; quite a simple thing . i shall wear a large bonnet , and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm . here , —probably this basket with pink ribbon . nothing can be more simple , you see . and jane will have such another . there is to be no form or parade—a sort of gipsy party . we are to walk about your gardens , and gather the strawberries ourselves , and sit under trees ; —and whatever else you may like to provide , it is to be all out of doors—a table spread in the shade , you know . every thing as natural and simple as possible . is not that your idea ? ”
austen	emma	dinner was on table.—mrs . elton , before she could be spoken to , was ready ; and before mr. woodhouse had reached her with his request to be allowed to hand her into the dining-parlour , was saying—
austen	emma	when it came to such a pitch as this , she was not able to refrain from a start , or a heavy sigh , or even from walking about the room for a few seconds—and the only source whence any thing like consolation or composure could be drawn , was in the resolution of her own better conduct , and the hope that , however inferior in spirit and gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life to the past , it would yet find her more rational , more acquainted with herself , and leave her less to regret when it were gone .
austen	emma	he had found her agitated and low.—frank churchill was a villain.— he heard her declare that she had never loved him . frank churchill ’ s character was not desperate.—she was his own emma , by hand and word , when they returned into the house ; and if he could have thought of frank churchill then , he might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow .
austen	emma	“ oh ! miss woodhouse , i hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball . what a disappointment it would be ! i do look forward to it , i own , with _very_ great pleasure . ”
austen	emma	miss bates had just done as patty opened the door ; and her visitors walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to , pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good-will .
austen	emma	“ will he , indeed ? that will be very bad. ” “ how much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended . he was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else—which is just as it should be , for a thriving man . what has he to do with books ? and i have no doubt that he _will_ thrive , and be a very rich man in time—and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb _us_ . ”
austen	emma	emma ’ s attempts to stop her father had been vain ; and when he had reached such a point as this , she could not wonder at her brother-in-law ’ s breaking out . “ mr . perry , ” said he , in a voice of very strong displeasure , “ would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for . why does he make it any business of his , to wonder at what i do ? —at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another ? —i may be allowed , i hope , the use of my judgment as well as mr. perry.—i want his directions no more than his drugs. ” he paused—and growing cooler in a moment , added , with only sarcastic dryness , “ if mr. perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty , i should be as willing to prefer cromer to south end as he could himself . ”
austen	emma	“ and , moreover , if you must go to the sea , it had better not have been to south end . south end is an unhealthy place . perry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon south end . ”
austen	emma	“ my dearest harriet ! ” cried emma , putting her hand before her face , and jumping up , “ you make me more ashamed of myself than i can bear . remember it ? aye , i remember it all now ; all , except your saving this relic—i knew nothing of that till this moment—but the cutting the finger , and my recommending court-plaister , and saying i had none about me ! —oh ! my sins , my sins ! —and i had plenty all the while in my pocket ! —one of my senseless tricks ! —i deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life.—well— ( sitting down again ) —go on—what else ? ”
austen	emma	after these came a second set ; among the most come-at-able of whom were mrs. and miss bates , and mrs. goddard , three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from hartfield , and who were fetched and carried home so often , that mr. woodhouse thought it no hardship for either james or the horses . had it taken place only once a year , it would have been a grievance .
austen	emma	“ well , my dear jane , i believe we must be running away . the weather does not look well , and grandmama will be uneasy . you are too obliging , my dear miss woodhouse ; but we really must take leave . this has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed . i shall just go round by mrs. cole ’ s ; but i shall not stop three minutes : and , jane , you had better go home directly—i would not have you out in a shower ! —we think she is the better for highbury already . thank you , we do indeed . i shall not attempt calling on mrs. goddard , for i really do not think she cares for any thing but _boiled_ pork : when we dress the leg it will be another thing . good morning to you , my dear sir . oh ! mr. knightley is coming too . well , that is so very ! —i am sure if jane is tired , you will be so kind as to give her your arm.—mr . elton , and miss hawkins ! —good morning to you . ”
austen	emma	“ imprudent , if you please—but not mad . excepting inequality of fortune , and perhaps a little disparity of age , i can see nothing unsuitable. ” “ but mr. knightley does not want to marry . i am sure he has not the least idea of it . do not put it into his head . why should he marry ? —he is as happy as possible by himself ; with his farm , and his sheep , and his library , and all the parish to manage ; and he is extremely fond of his brother ’ s children . he has no occasion to marry , either to fill up his time or his heart . ”
austen	emma	“ i did , ” replied emma , “ and they can not forgive me. ” he shook his head ; but there was a smile of indulgence with it , and he only said , “ i shall not scold you . i leave you to your own reflections . ”
austen	emma	chapter xvii mr. and mrs. john knightley were not detained long at hartfield . the weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move ; and mr. woodhouse having , as usual , tried to persuade his daughter to stay behind with all her children , was obliged to see the whole party set off , and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor isabella ; —which poor isabella , passing her life with those she doated on , full of their merits , blind to their faults , and always innocently busy , might have been a model of right feminine happiness .
austen	emma	it is remarkable , that emma , in the many , very many , points of view in which she was now beginning to consider donwell abbey , was never struck with any sense of injury to her nephew henry , whose rights as heir-expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded . think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy ; and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it , and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of mr. knightley ’ s marrying jane fairfax , or any body else , which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt .
austen	emma	“ i certainly do forget to think of _her_ , ” said emma , “ as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend. ” he looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment .
austen	emma	in this style she ran on ; never thoroughly stopped by any thing till mr. woodhouse came into the room ; her vanity had then a change of object , and emma heard her saying in the same half-whisper to jane ,
austen	emma	“ pray take care , mrs. weston , there is a step at the turning . pray take care , miss woodhouse , ours is rather a dark staircase—rather darker and narrower than one could wish . miss smith , pray take care . miss woodhouse , i am quite concerned , i am sure you hit your foot . miss smith , the step at the turning . ”
austen	emma	“ will you be so kind , ” said she , “ when i am missed , as to say that i am gone home ? —i am going this moment.—my aunt is not aware how late it is , nor how long we have been absent—but i am sure we shall be wanted , and i am determined to go directly.—i have said nothing about it to any body . it would only be giving trouble and distress . some are gone to the ponds , and some to the lime walk . till they all come in i shall not be missed ; and when they do , will you have the goodness to say that i am gone ? ”
austen	emma	“ i have never had a high opinion of frank churchill.—i can suppose , however , that i may have underrated him . my acquaintance with him has been but trifling.—and even if i have not underrated him hitherto , he may yet turn out well.—with such a woman he has a chance.—i have no motive for wishing him ill—and for her sake , whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct , i shall certainly wish him well . ”
austen	emma	as long as mr. knightley remained with them , emma ’ s fever continued ; but when he was gone , she began to be a little tranquillised and subdued—and in the course of the sleepless night , which was the tax for such an evening , she found one or two such very serious points to consider , as made her feel , that even her happiness must have some alloy . her father—and harriet . she could not be alone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims ; and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost , was the question . with respect to her father , it was a question soon answered . she hardly knew yet what mr. knightley would ask ; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father.—she even wept over the idea of it , as a sin of thought . while he lived , it must be only an engagement ; but she flattered herself , that if divested of the danger of drawing her away , it might become an increase of comfort to him.—how to do her best by harriet , was of more difficult decision ; —how to spare her from any unnecessary pain ; how to make her any possible atonement ; how to appear least her enemy ? —on these subjects , her perplexity and distress were very great—and her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it.—she could only resolve at last , that she would still avoid a meeting with her , and communicate all that need be told by letter ; that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just now for a time from highbury , and—indulging in one scheme more—nearly resolve , that it might be practicable to get an invitation for her to brunswick square.—isabella had been pleased with harriet ; and a few weeks spent in london must give her some amusement.—she did not think it in harriet ’ s nature to escape being benefited by novelty and variety , by the streets , the shops , and the children.—at any rate , it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself , from whom every thing was due ; a separation for the present ; an averting of the evil day , when they must all be together again .
austen	emma	they sat down to tea—the same party round the same table—how often it had been collected ! —and how often had her eyes fallen on the same shrubs in the lawn , and observed the same beautiful effect of the western sun ! —but never in such a state of spirits , never in any thing like it ; and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house , or even the attentive daughter .
austen	emma	“ i was with mr. cole on business an hour and a half ago . he had just read elton ’ s letter as i was shewn in , and handed it to me directly . ”
austen	emma	“ to be sure we do , ” cried his father ; “ mrs . bates—we passed her house—i saw miss bates at the window . true , true , you are acquainted with miss fairfax ; i remember you knew her at weymouth , and a fine girl she is . call upon her , by all means . ”
austen	emma	“ it was her very particular friend , you know. ” “ poor comfort ! ” said emma , laughing . “ one would rather have a stranger preferred than one ’ s very particular friend—with a stranger it might not recur again—but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand , to do every thing better than one does oneself ! —poor mrs. dixon ! well , i am glad she is gone to settle in ireland . ”
austen	emma	isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be expected ; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits , which appeared perfectly natural , as there was a dentist to be consulted ; but , since that business had been over , she did not appear to find harriet different from what she had known her before.—isabella , to be sure , was no very quick observer ; yet if harriet had not been equal to playing with the children , it would not have escaped her . emma ’ s comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on , by harriet ’ s being to stay longer ; her fortnight was likely to be a month at least . mr. and mrs. john knightley were to come down in august , and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back .
austen	emma	emma felt that mrs. weston was giving her a momentary glance ; and she was herself struck by his warmth . with a faint blush , she presently replied , “ such attentions as mrs. elton ’ s , i should have imagined , would rather disgust than gratify miss fairfax . mrs. elton ’ s invitations i should have imagined any thing but inviting . ”
austen	emma	her mutterings were chiefly to her husband ; and he murmured , in reply , “ very true , my love , very true . exactly so , indeed—quite unheard of—but some ladies say any thing . better pass it off as a joke . every body knows what is due to _you_ . ”
austen	emma	“ mr . knightley ’ s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare mr. martin with _him_ . you might not see one in a hundred with _gentleman_ so plainly written as in mr. knightley . but he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to . what say you to mr. weston and mr. elton ? compare mr. martin with either of _them_ . compare their manner of carrying themselves ; of walking ; of speaking ; of being silent . you must see the difference . ”
austen	emma	“ i do not know whether it ought to be so , but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way . wickedness is always wickedness , but folly is not always folly.—it depends upon the character of those who handle it . mr. knightley , he is _not_ a trifling , silly young man . if he were , he would have done this differently . he would either have gloried in the achievement , or been ashamed of it . there would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb , or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities.—no , i am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly . ”
austen	emma	“ and when , ” thought emma , “ will there be a beginning of mr. churchill ? ” she had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already made , and could not but hope that the gipsy , though she had _told_ no fortune , might be proved to have made harriet ’ s.—about a fortnight after the alarm , they came to a sufficient explanation , and quite undesignedly . emma was not thinking of it at the moment , which made the information she received more valuable . she merely said , in the course of some trivial chat , “ well , harriet , whenever you marry i would advise you to do so and so ” —and thought no more of it , till after a minute ’ s silence she heard harriet say in a very serious tone , “ i shall never marry . ”
austen	emma	emma could not doubt . it was a palpable display , repeated on every possible occasion . when they had all talked a little while in harmony of the weather and mrs. weston , she found herself abruptly addressed with ,
austen	emma	“ you had better order the carriage directly , my love , ” said she ; “ i dare say we shall be able to get along , if we set off directly ; and if we do come to any thing very bad , i can get out and walk . i am not at all afraid . i should not mind walking half the way . i could change my shoes , you know , the moment i got home ; and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold . ”
austen	emma	in short , she sat , during the first visit , looking at jane fairfax with twofold complacency ; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice , and was determining that she would dislike her no longer . when she took in her history , indeed , her situation , as well as her beauty ; when she considered what all this elegance was destined to , what she was going to sink from , how she was going to live , it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect ; especially , if to every well-known particular entitling her to interest , were added the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to mr. dixon , which she had so naturally started to herself . in that case , nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on . emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced mr. dixon ’ s affections from his wife , or of any thing mischievous which her imagination had suggested at first . if it were love , it might be simple , single , successless love on her side alone . she might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison , while a sharer of his conversation with her friend ; and from the best , the purest of motives , might now be denying herself this visit to ireland , and resolving to divide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty .
austen	emma	“ have you indeed no idea ? ” said mrs. weston in a trembling voice . “ can not you , my dear emma— can not you form a guess as to what you are to hear ? ” “ so far as that it relates to mr. frank churchill , i do guess . ”
austen	emma	“ a bad thing ! do you really think it a bad thing ? —why so ? ” “ i think they will neither of them do the other any good. ” “ you surprize me ! emma must do harriet good : and by supplying her with a new object of interest , harriet may be said to do emma good . i have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure . how very differently we feel ! —not think they will do each other any good ! this will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about emma , mr. knightley . ”
austen	emma	emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure . it was the end of an old pencil , —the part without any lead . “ this was really his , ” said harriet.— “ do not you remember one morning ? —no , i dare say you do not . but one morning—i forget exactly the day—but perhaps it was the tuesday or wednesday before _that_ _evening_ , he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket-book ; it was about spruce-beer . mr. knightley had been telling him something about brewing spruce-beer , and he wanted to put it down ; but when he took out his pencil , there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away , and it would not do , so you lent him another , and this was left upon the table as good for nothing . but i kept my eye on it ; and , as soon as i dared , caught it up , and never parted with it again from that moment . ”
austen	emma	“ well ; —if _you_ wish me to stay and join the party , i will. ” she smiled her acceptance ; and nothing less than a summons from richmond was to take him back before the following evening .
austen	emma	emma was pleased with the thought ; and producing the box , the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets , which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves . they were rapidly forming words for each other , or for any body else who would be puzzled . the quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for mr. woodhouse , who had often been distressed by the more animated sort , which mr. weston had occasionally introduced , and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting , with tender melancholy , over the departure of the “ poor little boys , ” or in fondly pointing out , as he took up any stray letter near him , how beautifully emma had written it .
austen	emma	“ it is as well , perhaps , that i have not had the possibility . had you not been surrounded by other friends , i might have been tempted to introduce a subject , to ask questions , to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct.—i feel that i should certainly have been impertinent . ”
austen	emma	“ just as they always do—very vulgar. ” “ they told me something , ” said harriet rather hesitatingly ; “ but it is nothing of any consequence. ” emma was obliged to ask what they had told her , though fearful of its producing mr. elton .
austen	emma	harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed , without reproaches , or apparent sense of ill-usage ; and yet emma fancied there was a something of resentment , a something bordering on it in her style , which increased the desirableness of their being separate.—it might be only her own consciousness ; but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke .
austen	emma	“ oh ! yes—mr . elton , i understand—certainly as to dancing—mrs . cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at bath was—mrs . cole was so kind as to sit some time with us , talking of jane ; for as soon as she came in , she began inquiring after her , jane is so very great a favourite there . whenever she is with us , mrs. cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough ; and i must say that jane deserves it as much as any body can . and so she began inquiring after her directly , saying , ‘ i know you can not have heard from jane lately , because it is not her time for writing ; ’ and when i immediately said , ‘ but indeed we have , we had a letter this very morning , ’ i do not know that i ever saw any body more surprized . ‘ have you , upon your honour ? ’ said she ; ‘ well , that is quite unexpected . do let me hear what she says . ’ ”
austen	emma	“ donwell ! ” cried his wife.— “ my dear mr. e. , you have not been to donwell ! —you mean the crown ; you come from the meeting at the crown. ” “ no , no , that ’ s to-morrow ; and i particularly wanted to see knightley to-day on that very account.—such a dreadful broiling morning ! —i went over the fields too— ( speaking in a tone of great ill-usage , ) which made it so much the worse . and then not to find him at home ! i assure you i am not at all pleased . and no apology left , no message for me . the housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected.—very extraordinary ! —and nobody knew at all which way he was gone . perhaps to hartfield , perhaps to the abbey mill , perhaps into his woods.—miss woodhouse , this is not like our friend knightley ! —can you explain it ? ”
austen	emma	“ and i am sure i should never want to go there ; for i am never happy but at hartfield. ” some time afterwards it was , “ i think mrs. goddard would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened . i am sure miss nash would—for miss nash thinks her own sister very well married , and it is only a linen-draper . ”
austen	emma	“ well , he is coming , you see ; good news , i think . well , what do you say to it ? —i always told you he would be here again soon , did not i ? —anne , my dear , did not i always tell you so , and you would not believe me ? —in town next week , you see—at the latest , i dare say ; for _she_ is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done ; most likely they will be there to-morrow or saturday . as to her illness , all nothing of course . but it is an excellent thing to have frank among us again , so near as town . they will stay a good while when they do come , and he will be half his time with us . this is precisely what i wanted . well , pretty good news , is not it ? have you finished it ? has emma read it all ? put it up , put it up ; we will have a good talk about it some other time , but it will not do now . i shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way . ”
austen	emma	“ this is an alliance which , whoever—whatever your friends may be , must be agreeable to them , provided at least they have common sense ; and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools . if they are anxious to see you _happily_ married , here is a man whose amiable character gives every assurance of it ; —if they wish to have you settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen to place you in , here it will be accomplished ; and if their only object is that you should , in the common phrase , be _well_ married , here is the comfortable fortune , the respectable establishment , the rise in the world which must satisfy them . ”
austen	emma	her own conduct , as well as her own heart , was before her in the same few minutes . she saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed her before . how improperly had she been acting by harriet ! how inconsiderate , how indelicate , how irrational , how unfeeling had been her conduct ! what blindness , what madness , had led her on ! it struck her with dreadful force , and she was ready to give it every bad name in the world . some portion of respect for herself , however , in spite of all these demerits—some concern for her own appearance , and a strong sense of justice by harriet— ( there would be no need of _compassion_ to the girl who believed herself loved by mr. knightley—but justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now , ) gave emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness , with even apparent kindness.—for her own advantage indeed , it was fit that the utmost extent of harriet ’ s hopes should be enquired into ; and harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained—or to deserve to be slighted by the person , whose counsels had never led her right.—rousing from reflection , therefore , and subduing her emotion , she turned to harriet again , and , in a more inviting accent , renewed the conversation ; for as to the subject which had first introduced it , the wonderful story of jane fairfax , that was quite sunk and lost.—neither of them thought but of mr. knightley and themselves .
austen	emma	“ we shall never agree about him , ” cried emma ; “ but that is nothing extraordinary . i have not the least idea of his being a weak young man : i feel sure that he is not . mr. weston would not be blind to folly , though in his own son ; but he is very likely to have a more yielding , complying , mild disposition than would suit your notions of man ’ s perfection . i dare say he has ; and though it may cut him off from some advantages , it will secure him many others . ”
austen	emma	“ well , my dear , ” he deliberately began , “ considering we never saw her before , she seems a very pretty sort of young lady ; and i dare say she was very much pleased with you . she speaks a little too quick . a little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear . but i believe i am nice ; i do not like strange voices ; and nobody speaks like you and poor miss taylor . however , she seems a very obliging , pretty-behaved young lady , and no doubt will make him a very good wife . though i think he had better not have married . i made the best excuses i could for not having been able to wait on him and mrs. elton on this happy occasion ; i said that i hoped i _should_ in the course of the summer . but i ought to have gone before . not to wait upon a bride is very remiss . ah ! it shews what a sad invalid i am ! but i do not like the corner into vicarage lane . ”
austen	emma	mrs. weston was acting no part , feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event.—she had been extremely surprized , never more so , than when emma first opened the affair to her ; but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all , and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost.—she had such a regard for mr. knightley , as to think he deserved even her dearest emma ; and it was in every respect so proper , suitable , and unexceptionable a connexion , and in one respect , one point of the highest importance , so peculiarly eligible , so singularly fortunate , that now it seemed as if emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature , and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it , and wished it long ago.—how very few of those men in a rank of life to address emma would have renounced their own home for hartfield ! and who but mr. knightley could know and bear with mr. woodhouse , so as to make such an arrangement desirable ! —the difficulty of disposing of poor mr. woodhouse had been always felt in her husband ’ s plans and her own , for a marriage between frank and emma . how to settle the claims of enscombe and hartfield had been a continual impediment—less acknowledged by mr. weston than by herself—but even he had never been able to finish the subject better than by saying— “ those matters will take care of themselves ; the young people will find a way. ” but here there was nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future . it was all right , all open , all equal . no sacrifice on any side worth the name . it was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself , and without one real , rational difficulty to oppose or delay it .
austen	emma	“ aye , very true , my dear , ” cried the latter , though jane had not spoken a word— “ i was just going to say the same thing . it is time for us to be going indeed . the evening is closing in , and grandmama will be looking for us . my dear sir , you are too obliging . we really must wish you good night . ”
austen	emma	“ emma never thinks of herself , if she can do good to others , ” rejoined mr. woodhouse , understanding but in part . “ but , my dear , pray do not make any more matches ; they are silly things , and break up one ’ s family circle grievously . ”
austen	emma	emma did not want to be classed with the mrs. eltons , the mrs. perrys , and the mrs. coles , who would force themselves anywhere ; neither could she feel any right of preference herself—she submitted , therefore , and only questioned miss bates farther as to her niece ’ s appetite and diet , which she longed to be able to assist . on that subject poor miss bates was very unhappy , and very communicative ; jane would hardly eat any thing : —mr . perry recommended nourishing food ; but every thing they could command ( and never had any body such good neighbours ) was distasteful .
austen	emma	“ very likely , ” said emma— “ nothing more likely . i know no man more likely than mr. knightley to do the sort of thing—to do any thing really good-natured , useful , considerate , or benevolent . he is not a gallant man , but he is a very humane one ; and this , considering jane fairfax ’ s ill-health , would appear a case of humanity to him ; —and for an act of unostentatious kindness , there is nobody whom i would fix on more than on mr. knightley . i know he had horses to-day—for we arrived together ; and i laughed at him about it , but he said not a word that could betray . ”
austen	emma	she could not enter the house again , could not be in the same room to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago , to lace up her boot , without _recollecting_ . a thousand vexatious thoughts would recur . compliments , charades , and horrible blunders ; and it was not to be supposed that poor harriet should not be recollecting too ; but she behaved very well , and was only rather pale and silent . the visit was of course short ; and there was so much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it , that emma would not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady , and on no account to give one , beyond the nothing-meaning terms of being “ elegantly dressed , and very pleasing . ”
austen	emma	“ i have no doubt of it. ” and it was spoken with a sort of sighing animation , which had a vast deal of the lover . she was not less pleased another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers , to have harriet ’ s picture .
austen	emma	“ it was short—merely to announce—but cheerful , exulting , of course. ” — here was a sly glance at emma . “ he had been so fortunate as to—i forget the precise words—one has no business to remember them . the information was , as you state , that he was going to be married to a miss hawkins . by his style , i should imagine it just settled . ”
austen	emma	“ my idea of him is , that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of every body , and has the power as well as the wish of being universally agreeable . to you , he will talk of farming ; to me , of drawing or music ; and so on to every body , having that general information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead , or take the lead , just as propriety may require , and to speak extremely well on each ; that is my idea of him . ”
austen	emma	in one respect mrs. elton grew even worse than she had appeared at first . her feelings altered towards emma.—offended , probably , by the little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with , she drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant ; and though the effect was agreeable , the ill-will which produced it was necessarily increasing emma ’ s dislike . her manners , too—and mr. elton ’ s , were unpleasant towards harriet . they were sneering and negligent . emma hoped it must rapidly work harriet ’ s cure ; but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very much.—it was not to be doubted that poor harriet ’ s attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve , and her own share in the story , under a colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to him , had in all likelihood been given also . she was , of course , the object of their joint dislike.—when they had nothing else to say , it must be always easy to begin abusing miss woodhouse ; and the enmity which they dared not shew in open disrespect to her , found a broader vent in contemptuous treatment of harriet .
austen	emma	in general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their mornings ; but one complete dinner engagement , and out of the house too , there was no avoiding , though at christmas . mr. weston would take no denial ; they must all dine at randalls one day ; —even mr. woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party .
austen	emma	“ you are in luck.—your only blunder was confined to my ear , when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady. ” “ true . but as i have always had a thoroughly good opinion of miss fairfax , i never could , under any blunder , have spoken ill of her ; and as to speaking ill of him , there i must have been safe . ”
austen	emma	harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude . emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her friend . its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind—and it must be saving her from the danger of degradation .
austen	emma	the unpersuadable point , which he did not mention , emma guessed to be good behaviour to his father . “ i have made a most wretched discovery , ” said he , after a short pause.— “ i have been here a week to-morrow—half my time . i never knew days fly so fast . a week to-morrow ! —and i have hardly begun to enjoy myself . but just got acquainted with mrs. weston , and others ! —i hate the recollection . ”
austen	emma	“ you have heard of a certain frank churchill , i presume , ” he continued— “ and know him to be my son , though he does not bear my name. ” “ oh ! yes , and i shall be very happy in his acquaintance . i am sure mr. elton will lose no time in calling on him ; and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the vicarage . ”
austen	emma	“ i am afraid we must be running away , ” said emma , glancing at harriet , and beginning to rise— “ my father will be expecting us . i had no intention , i thought i had no power of staying more than five minutes , when i first entered the house . i merely called , because i would not pass the door without inquiring after mrs. bates ; but i have been so pleasantly detained ! now , however , we must wish you and mrs. bates good morning . ”
austen	emma	“ i would not go away without seeing you , but i have no time to spare , and therefore must now be gone directly . i am going to london , to spend a few days with john and isabella . have you any thing to send or say , besides the ‘ love , ’ which nobody carries ? ”
austen	emma	chapter vi the next morning brought mr. frank churchill again . he came with mrs. weston , to whom and to highbury he seemed to take very cordially . he had been sitting with her , it appeared , most companionably at home , till her usual hour of exercise ; and on being desired to chuse their walk , immediately fixed on highbury.— “ he did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction , but if left to him , he should always chuse the same . highbury , that airy , cheerful , happy-looking highbury , would be his constant attraction. ” —highbury , with mrs. weston , stood for hartfield ; and she trusted to its bearing the same construction with him . they walked thither directly .
austen	emma	“ no , no , ” said she , “ you are quite unreasonable . it would be dreadful to be standing so close ! nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowd—and a crowd in a little room ! ”
austen	emma	she owned that , considering every thing , she was not absolutely without inclination for the party . the coles expressed themselves so properly—there was so much real attention in the manner of it—so much consideration for her father . “ they would have solicited the honour earlier , but had been waiting the arrival of a folding-screen from london , which they hoped might keep mr. woodhouse from any draught of air , and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour of his company. ” upon the whole , she was very persuadable ; and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting his comfort—how certainly mrs. goddard , if not mrs. bates , might be depended on for bearing him company—mr . woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughter ’ s going out to dinner on a day now near at hand , and spending the whole evening away from him . as for _his_ going , emma did not wish him to think it possible , the hours would be too late , and the party too numerous . he was soon pretty well resigned .
austen	emma	this proposal of his , this plan of marrying and continuing at hartfield—the more she contemplated it , the more pleasing it became . his evils seemed to lessen , her own advantages to increase , their mutual good to outweigh every drawback . such a companion for herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her ! —such a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of melancholy !
austen	emma	“ she is a riddle , quite a riddle ! ” said she.— “ to chuse to remain here month after month , under privations of every sort ! and now to chuse the mortification of mrs. elton ’ s notice and the penury of her conversation , rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her with such real , generous affection . ”
austen	emma	no invitation came amiss to her . her bath habits made evening-parties perfectly natural to her , and maple grove had given her a taste for dinners . she was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms , at the poor attempt at rout-cakes , and there being no ice in the highbury card-parties . mrs. bates , mrs. perry , mrs. goddard and others , were a good deal behind-hand in knowledge of the world , but she would soon shew them how every thing ought to be arranged . in the course of the spring she must return their civilities by one very superior party—in which her card-tables should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs in the true style—and more waiters engaged for the evening than their own establishment could furnish , to carry round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour , and in the proper order .
austen	emma	“ it is very pretty , ” said mr. woodhouse . “ so prettily done ! just as your drawings always are , my dear . i do not know any body who draws so well as you do . the only thing i do not thoroughly like is , that she seems to be sitting out of doors , with only a little shawl over her shoulders—and it makes one think she must catch cold . ”
austen	emma	“ it was an awkward business , my dear , your spending the autumn at south end instead of coming here . i never had much opinion of the sea air. ” “ mr . wingfield most strenuously recommended it , sir—or we should not have gone . he recommended it for all the children , but particularly for the weakness in little bella ’ s throat , —both sea air and bathing . ”
austen	emma	“ how ? —they were invited , were not they ? ” “ oh ! yes—but how they were conveyed hither ? —the manner of their coming ? ” “ they walked , i conclude . how else could they come ? ” “ very true.—well , a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have jane fairfax walking home again , late at night , and cold as the nights are now . and as i looked at her , though i never saw her appear to more advantage , it struck me that she was heated , and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold . poor girl ! i could not bear the idea of it ; so , as soon as mr. weston came into the room , and i could get at him , i spoke to him about the carriage . you may guess how readily he came into my wishes ; and having his approbation , i made my way directly to miss bates , to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took us home ; for i thought it would be making her comfortable at once . good soul ! she was as grateful as possible , you may be sure . ‘ nobody was ever so fortunate as herself ! ’ —but with many , many thanks— ‘ there was no occasion to trouble us , for mr. knightley ’ s carriage had brought , and was to take them home again. ’ i was quite surprized ; —very glad , i am sure ; but really quite surprized . such a very kind attention—and so thoughtful an attention ! —the sort of thing that so few men would think of . and , in short , from knowing his usual ways , i am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all . i do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself , and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them . ”
austen	emma	from that moment , emma could have taken her oath that mr. knightley had had no concern in giving the instrument . but whether he were entirely free from peculiar attachment—whether there were no actual preference—remained a little longer doubtful . towards the end of jane ’ s second song , her voice grew thick .
austen	emma	“ if we were in the other room , ” said emma , “ if i had my writing-desk , i am sure i could produce a specimen . i have a note of his.—do not you remember , mrs. weston , employing him to write for you one day ? ”
austen	emma	she followed another carriage to mr. cole ’ s door ; and was pleased to see that it was mr. knightley ’ s ; for mr. knightley keeping no horses , having little spare money and a great deal of health , activity , and independence , was too apt , in emma ’ s opinion , to get about as he could , and not use his carriage so often as became the owner of donwell abbey . she had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from her heart , for he stopped to hand her out .
austen	emma	emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech , and saw no alarming symptoms of love . the young man had been the first admirer , but she trusted there was no other hold , and that there would be no serious difficulty , on harriet ’ s side , to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own .
austen	emma	“ it is to be a secret , i conclude , ” said he . “ these matters are always a secret , till it is found out that every body knows them . only let me be told when i may speak out.—i wonder whether jane has any suspicion . ”
austen	emma	“ he chose to say he was employed ” — “ well , well , i have that note ; and can shew it after dinner to convince mr. knightley. ” “ oh ! when a gallant young man , like mr. frank churchill , ” said mr. knightley dryly , “ writes to a fair lady like miss woodhouse , he will , of course , put forth his best . ”
austen	emma	she was pleased , on taking leave , to find miss fairfax determined to attend her out of the room , to go with her even downstairs ; it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of , to say ,
austen	emma	both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again ; and after a few minutes silence , he said , “ another thing must be taken into consideration too—mrs . elton does not talk _to_ miss fairfax as she speaks _of_ her . we all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou , the plainest spoken amongst us ; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other—a something more early implanted . we can not give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before . we feel things differently . and besides the operation of this , as a general principle , you may be sure that miss fairfax awes mrs. elton by her superiority both of mind and manner ; and that , face to face , mrs. elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to . such a woman as jane fairfax probably never fell in mrs. elton ’ s way before—and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action , if not in consciousness . ”
austen	emma	“ can you come to randalls at any time this morning ? —do , if it be possible . mrs. weston wants to see you . she must see you. ” “ is she unwell ? ” “ no , no , not at all—only a little agitated . she would have ordered the carriage , and come to you , but she must see you _alone_ , and that you know— ( nodding towards her father ) —humph ! —can you come ? ”
austen	emma	“ yes , ” said he , smiling . “ you are better placed _here_ ; very fit for a wife , but not at all for a governess . but you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at hartfield . you might not give emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise ; but you were receiving a very good education from _her_ , on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will , and doing as you were bid ; and if weston had asked me to recommend him a wife , i should certainly have named miss taylor . ”
austen	emma	she stopped to breathe . emma thought first of herself , and then of harriet . “ more than an attachment , indeed , ” resumed mrs. weston ; “ an engagement—a positive engagement.—what will you say , emma—what will any body say , when it is known that frank churchill and miss fairfax are engaged ; —nay , that they have been long engaged ! ”
austen	emma	“ mrs . john knightley is easily alarmed , and might be made unhappy about her sister. ” “ be satisfied , ” said he , “ i will not raise any outcry . i will keep my ill-humour to myself . i have a very sincere interest in emma . isabella does not seem more my sister ; has never excited a greater interest ; perhaps hardly so great . there is an anxiety , a curiosity in what one feels for emma . i wonder what will become of her ! ”
austen	emma	“ what an amiable creature i was ! —no wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance. ” “ ‘ mr . knightley. ’ —you always called me , ‘ mr . knightley ; ’ and , from habit , it has not so very formal a sound.—and yet it is formal . i want you to call me something else , but i do not know what . ”
austen	emma	“ not till the reserve ceases towards oneself ; and then the attraction may be the greater . but i must be more in want of a friend , or an agreeable companion , than i have yet been , to take the trouble of conquering any body ’ s reserve to procure one . intimacy between miss fairfax and me is quite out of the question . i have no reason to think ill of her—not the least—except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner , such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body , is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal . ”
austen	emma	“ to be sure , so it is . but they live very comfortably . they have no indoors man , else they do not want for any thing ; and mrs. martin talks of taking a boy another year . ”
austen	emma	mrs. elton was spoken of . “ i think she must be here soon , ” said he . “ i have a great curiosity to see mrs. elton , i have heard so much of her . it can not be long , i think , before she comes . ”
austen	emma	“ why will not you write one yourself for us , mr. elton ? ” said she ; “ that is the only security for its freshness ; and nothing could be easier to you. ” “ oh no ! he had never written , hardly ever , any thing of the kind in his life . the stupidest fellow ! he was afraid not even miss woodhouse ” —he stopt a moment— “ or miss smith could inspire him . ”
austen	emma	“ it is certainly very well regulated. ” “ so seldom that any negligence or blunder appears ! so seldom that a letter , among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom , is even carried wrong—and not one in a million , i suppose , actually lost ! and when one considers the variety of hands , and of bad hands too , that are to be deciphered , it increases the wonder . ”
austen	emma	emma would not have smiled for the world , and only said , “ is mr. elton gone on foot to donwell ? —he will have a hot walk. ” “ oh ! no , it is a meeting at the crown , a regular meeting . weston and cole will be there too ; but one is apt to speak only of those who lead.—i fancy mr. e. and knightley have every thing their own way . ”
austen	emma	“ that is , ” replied mr. knightley , “ she will indulge her even more than she did you , and believe that she does not indulge her at all . it will be the only difference . ”
austen	emma	she did not really like her . she would not be in a hurry to find fault , but she suspected that there was no elegance ; —ease , but not elegance.— she was almost sure that for a young woman , a stranger , a bride , there was too much ease . her person was rather good ; her face not unpretty ; but neither feature , nor air , nor voice , nor manner , were elegant . emma thought at least it would turn out so .
austen	emma	he brought all the music to her , and they looked it over together.—emma took the opportunity of whispering , “ you speak too plain . she must understand you. ” “ i hope she does . i would have her understand me . i am not in the least ashamed of my meaning . ”
austen	emma	“ nonsense , errant nonsense , as ever was talked ! ” cried mr. knightley.— “ robert martin ’ s manners have sense , sincerity , and good-humour to recommend them ; and his mind has more true gentility than harriet smith could understand . ”
austen	emma	“ the arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me . i wanted to know a little more , and this tells me quite enough . depend upon it , we shall soon hear that it is a present from mr. and mrs. dixon . ”
austen	emma	“ when i got to donwell , ” said he , “ knightley could not be found . very odd ! very unaccountable ! after the note i sent him this morning , and the message he returned , that he should certainly be at home till one . ”
austen	emma	“ henry is a fine boy , but john is very like his mama . henry is the eldest , he was named after me , not after his father . john , the second , is named after his father . some people are surprized , i believe , that the eldest was not , but isabella would have him called henry , which i thought very pretty of her . and he is a very clever boy , indeed . they are all remarkably clever ; and they have so many pretty ways . they will come and stand by my chair , and say , ‘ grandpapa , can you give me a bit of string ? ’ and once henry asked me for a knife , but i told him knives were only made for grandpapas . i think their father is too rough with them very often . ”
austen	emma	the evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from mr. elton to mr. woodhouse , a long , civil , ceremonious note , to say , with mr. elton ’ s best compliments , “ that he was proposing to leave highbury the following morning in his way to bath ; where , in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends , he had engaged to spend a few weeks , and very much regretted the impossibility he was under , from various circumstances of weather and business , of taking a personal leave of mr. woodhouse , of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense—and had mr. woodhouse any commands , should be happy to attend to them . ”
austen	emma	“ oh ! mr. weston , do not mistake me . selina is no fine lady , i assure you . do not run away with such an idea. ” “ is not she ? then she is no rule for mrs. churchill , who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld . ”
austen	emma	chapter x the appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered , was tranquillity itself ; mrs. bates , deprived of her usual employment , slumbering on one side of the fire , frank churchill , at a table near her , most deedily occupied about her spectacles , and jane fairfax , standing with her back to them , intent on her pianoforte .
austen	emma	“ indeed ! ” replied he . “ then , my dear isabella , it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world , for in general every thing does give you cold . walk home ! —you are prettily shod for walking home , i dare say . it will be bad enough for the horses . ”
austen	emma	“ well , well , i am ready ; ” —and turning again to emma , “ but you must not be expecting such a _very_ fine young man ; you have only had _my_ account you know ; i dare say he is really nothing extraordinary : ” —though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very different conviction .
austen	emma	“ mermaids and sharks ! nonsense ! my dear harriet , what are you thinking of ? where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark ? give me the paper and listen .
austen	emma	emma laughed , and replied , “ my being charming , harriet , is not quite enough to induce me to marry ; i must find other people charming—one other person at least . and i am not only , not going to be married , at present , but have very little intention of ever marrying at all . ”
austen	emma	“ if it were admissible to contradict a lady , ” said the gallant mr. elton— “ i have perhaps given her a little more decision of character , have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before . ”
austen	emma	the whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing-room when mr. weston made his appearance among them . he had returned to a late dinner , and walked to hartfield as soon as it was over . he had been too much expected by the best judges , for surprize—but there was great joy . mr. woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now , as he would have been sorry to see him before . john knightley only was in mute astonishment.—that a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day of business in london , should set off again , and walk half a mile to another man ’ s house , for the sake of being in mixed company till bed-time , of finishing his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers , was a circumstance to strike him deeply . a man who had been in motion since eight o ’ clock in the morning , and might now have been still , who had been long talking , and might have been silent , who had been in more than one crowd , and might have been alone ! —such a man , to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside , and on the evening of a cold sleety april day rush out again into the world ! —could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife , there would have been a motive ; but his coming would probably prolong rather than break up the party . john knightley looked at him with amazement , then shrugged his shoulders , and said , “ i could not have believed it even of _him_ . ”
austen	emma	he had a great deal to say in return , and very entertainingly ; but emma ’ s feelings were chiefly with jane , in the argument ; and on leaving randalls , and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men , she felt , that pleased as she had been to see frank churchill , and really regarding him as she did with friendship , she had never been more sensible of mr. knightley ’ s high superiority of character . the happiness of this most happy day , received its completion , in the animated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced .
austen	emma	although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings , mr. and mrs. weston ’ s visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune . something occurred while they were at hartfield , to make emma want their advice ; and , which was still more lucky , she wanted exactly the advice they gave .
austen	emma	it was the arrival of this very invitation while the westons were at hartfield , which made their presence so acceptable ; for though her first remark , on reading it , was that “ of course it must be declined , ” she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do , that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful .
austen	emma	miss bates , in her real anxiety for jane , could hardly stay even to be grateful , before she stept forward and put an end to all farther singing . here ceased the concert part of the evening , for miss woodhouse and miss fairfax were the only young lady performers ; but soon ( within five minutes ) the proposal of dancing—originating nobody exactly knew where—was so effectually promoted by mr. and mrs. cole , that every thing was rapidly clearing away , to give proper space . mrs. weston , capital in her country-dances , was seated , and beginning an irresistible waltz ; and frank churchill , coming up with most becoming gallantry to emma , had secured her hand , and led her up to the top .
austen	emma	“ proof indeed ! ” said emma , highly amused.— “ mr . dixon is very musical , is he ? we shall know more about them all , in half an hour , from you , than miss fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year . ”
austen	emma	with insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every body ’ s feelings ; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every body ’ s destiny . she was proved to have been universally mistaken ; and she had not quite done nothing—for she had done mischief . she had brought evil on harriet , on herself , and she too much feared , on mr. knightley.—were this most unequal of all connexions to take place , on her must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning ; for his attachment , she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of harriet ’ s ; —and even were this not the case , he would never have known harriet at all but for her folly .
austen	emma	emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone to bed , more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her , and to depend on getting tolerably out of it .
austen	emma	“ you may depend upon me , ” said she . “ i certainly will come . name your day , and i will come . you will allow me to bring jane fairfax ? ” “ i can not name a day , ” said he , “ till i have spoken to some others whom i would wish to meet you . ”
austen	emma	she met mr. weston on his entrance , with a smiling countenance , exclaiming , “ a very pretty trick you have been playing me , upon my word ! this was a device , i suppose , to sport with my curiosity , and exercise my talent of guessing . but you really frightened me . i thought you had lost half your property , at least . and here , instead of its being a matter of condolence , it turns out to be one of congratulation.—i congratulate you , mr. weston , with all my heart , on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in england for your daughter . ”
austen	emma	but at last there seemed a perverse turn ; it seemed all at once as if he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account , than on harriet ’ s—more anxious that she should escape the infection , than that there should be no infection in the complaint . he began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick-chamber again , for the present—to entreat her to _promise_ _him_ not to venture into such hazard till he had seen mr. perry and learnt his opinion ; and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course , there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her . she was vexed . it did appear—there was no concealing it—exactly like the pretence of being in love with her , instead of harriet ; an inconstancy , if real , the most contemptible and abominable ! and she had difficulty in behaving with temper . he turned to mrs. weston to implore her assistance , “ would not she give him her support ? —would not she add her persuasions to his , to induce miss woodhouse not to go to mrs. goddard ’ s till it were certain that miss smith ’ s disorder had no infection ? he could not be satisfied without a promise—would not she give him her influence in procuring it ? ”
austen	emma	“ no , indeed , i have no doubts at all on that head . i am delighted to find myself in such a circle . i hope we shall have many sweet little concerts together . i think , miss woodhouse , you and i must establish a musical club , and have regular weekly meetings at your house , or ours . will not it be a good plan ? if _we_ exert ourselves , i think we shall not be long in want of allies . something of that nature would be particularly desirable for _me_ , as an inducement to keep me in practice ; for married women , you know—there is a sad story against them , in general . they are but too apt to give up music . ”
austen	emma	“ poor miss taylor ! —i wish she were here again . what a pity it is that mr. weston ever thought of her ! ” “ i can not agree with you , papa ; you know i can not . mr. weston is such a good-humoured , pleasant , excellent man , that he thoroughly deserves a good wife ; —and you would not have had miss taylor live with us for ever , and bear all my odd humours , when she might have a house of her own ? ”
austen	emma	“ not at all . i should wish it. ” mr. knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity . “ he trifles here , ” said he , “ as to the temptation . he knows he is wrong , and has nothing rational to urge.—bad.—he ought not to have formed the engagement.— ‘ his father ’ s disposition : ’ —he is unjust , however , to his father . mr. weston ’ s sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions ; but mr. weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to gain it.—very true ; he did not come till miss fairfax was here . ”
austen	emma	with regard to her not accompanying them to ireland , her account to her aunt contained nothing but truth , though there might be some truths not told . it was her own choice to give the time of their absence to highbury ; to spend , perhaps , her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear : and the campbells , whatever might be their motive or motives , whether single , or double , or treble , gave the arrangement their ready sanction , and said , that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air , for the recovery of her health , than on any thing else . certain it was that she was to come ; and that highbury , instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised it—mr . frank churchill—must put up for the present with jane fairfax , who could bring only the freshness of a two years ’ absence .
austen	emma	it was well that he took every body ’ s joy for granted , or he might not have thought either mr. woodhouse or mr. knightley particularly delighted . they were the first entitled , after mrs. weston and emma , to be made happy ; —from them he would have proceeded to miss fairfax , but she was so deep in conversation with john knightley , that it would have been too positive an interruption ; and finding himself close to mrs. elton , and her attention disengaged , he necessarily began on the subject with her .
austen	emma	a week had not passed since miss hawkins ’ s name was first mentioned in highbury , before she was , by some means or other , discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind ; to be handsome , elegant , highly accomplished , and perfectly amiable : and when mr. elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects , and circulate the fame of her merits , there was very little more for him to do , than to tell her christian name , and say whose music she principally played .
austen	emma	“ he is very obliging , ” said emma ; “ but is he sure that harriet means to marry him ? ” “ well , well , means to make her an offer then . will that do ? he came to the abbey two evenings ago , on purpose to consult me about it . he knows i have a thorough regard for him and all his family , and , i believe , considers me as one of his best friends . he came to ask me whether i thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early ; whether i thought her too young : in short , whether i approved his choice altogether ; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered ( especially since _your_ making so much of her ) as in a line of society above him . i was very much pleased with all that he said . i never hear better sense from any one than robert martin . he always speaks to the purpose ; open , straightforward , and very well judging . he told me every thing ; his circumstances and plans , and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage . he is an excellent young man , both as son and brother . i had no hesitation in advising him to marry . he proved to me that he could afford it ; and that being the case , i was convinced he could not do better . i praised the fair lady too , and altogether sent him away very happy . if he had never esteemed my opinion before , he would have thought highly of me then ; and , i dare say , left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had . this happened the night before last . now , as we may fairly suppose , he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady , and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday , it is not unlikely that he should be at mrs. goddard ’ s to-day ; and she may be detained by a visitor , without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch . ”
austen	emma	what mr. elton had learned from the ostler on the subject , being the accumulation of the ostler ’ s own knowledge , and the knowledge of the servants at randalls , was , that a messenger had come over from richmond soon after the return of the party from box hill—which messenger , however , had been no more than was expected ; and that mr. churchill had sent his nephew a few lines , containing , upon the whole , a tolerable account of mrs. churchill , and only wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early ; but that mr. frank churchill having resolved to go home directly , without waiting at all , and his horse seeming to have got a cold , tom had been sent off immediately for the crown chaise , and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by , the boy going a good pace , and driving very steady .
austen	emma	but mr. elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits , not at all to confuse his intellects . he perfectly knew his own meaning ; and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious , and slightly touched upon his respect for miss smith as her friend , —but acknowledging his wonder that miss smith should be mentioned at all , —he resumed the subject of his own passion , and was very urgent for a favourable answer .
austen	emma	his first proposition and request , that the dance begun at mr. cole ’ s should be finished there—that the same party should be collected , and the same musician engaged , met with the readiest acquiescence . mr. weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment , and mrs. weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance ; and the interesting employment had followed , of reckoning up exactly who there would be , and portioning out the indispensable division of space to every couple .
austen	emma	“ i have no hesitation in saying , ” replied mr. elton , though hesitating a good deal while he spoke ; “ i have no hesitation in saying—at least if my friend feels at all as _i_ do—i have not the smallest doubt that , could he see his little effusion honoured as _i_ see it , ( looking at the book again , and replacing it on the table ) , he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life . ”
austen	emma	“ i am concerned to hear of it . i think they judge wisely . but mrs. dixon must be very much disappointed . mrs. dixon , i understand , has no remarkable degree of personal beauty ; is not , by any means , to be compared with miss fairfax . ”
austen	emma	chapter xviii time passed on . a few more to-morrows , and the party from london would be arriving . it was an alarming change ; and emma was thinking of it one morning , as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her , when mr. knightley came in , and distressing thoughts were put by . after the first chat of pleasure he was silent ; and then , in a graver tone , began with ,
austen	emma	“ i know there is such an idea with many people , but indeed it is quite a mistake , sir.—we all had our health perfectly well there , never found the least inconvenience from the mud ; and mr. wingfield says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy ; and i am sure he may be depended on , for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air , and his own brother and family have been there repeatedly . ”
austen	emma	they remained but a few minutes together , as miss woodhouse must not be kept waiting ; and harriet then came running to her with a smiling face , and in a flutter of spirits , which miss woodhouse hoped very soon to compose .
austen	emma	“ this explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted , and mr. weston has done very well for himself ; but he must have knocked up every body else . _perfection_ should not have come quite so soon . ”
austen	emma	“ but really , i am half ashamed , and wish i had never taken up the idea. ” “ i am very glad you did , and that you communicated it to me . i have now a key to all her odd looks and ways . leave shame to her . if she does wrong , she ought to feel it . ”
austen	emma	emma seriously hoped she would . she had a moment ’ s fear of miss bates keeping away from her . but miss bates soon came— “ very happy and obliged ” —but emma ’ s conscience told her that there was not the same cheerful volubility as before—less ease of look and manner . a very friendly inquiry after miss fairfax , she hoped , might lead the way to a return of old feelings . the touch seemed immediate .
austen	emma	“ how very pleasing and proper of him ! ” cried the good-hearted mrs. john knightley . “ i have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man . but how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father ! there is something so shocking in a child ’ s being taken away from his parents and natural home ! i never could comprehend how mr. weston could part with him . to give up one ’ s child ! i really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else . ”
austen	emma	“ you must feel it very fortunate that miss fairfax should be allowed to come to you at such a time . considering the very particular friendship between her and mrs. dixon , you could hardly have expected her to be excused from accompanying colonel and mrs. campbell . ”
austen	emma	“ you must make my apologies to your friend ; but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two . he may be sure of every woman ’ s approbation while he writes with such gallantry . ”
austen	emma	“ i wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him. ” “ well , there _is_ feeling here.—he does seem to have suffered in finding her ill.—certainly , i can have no doubt of his being fond of her . ‘ dearer , much dearer than ever. ’ i hope he may long continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliation.—he is a very liberal thanker , with his thousands and tens of thousands.— ‘ happier than i deserve. ’ come , he knows himself there . ‘ miss woodhouse calls me the child of good fortune. ’ —those were miss woodhouse ’ s words , were they ? — and a fine ending—and there is the letter . the child of good fortune ! that was your name for him , was it ? ”
austen	emma	“ there were misunderstandings between them , emma ; he said so expressly . he had not time to enter into much explanation . he was here only a quarter of an hour , and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay—but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said . the present crisis , indeed , seemed to be brought on by them ; and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct . ”
austen	emma	she would not look again . her heart was in a glow , and she feared her face might be as hot . in another moment a happier sight caught her ; —mr . knightley leading harriet to the set ! —never had she been more surprized , seldom more delighted , than at that instant . she was all pleasure and gratitude , both for harriet and herself , and longed to be thanking him ; and though too distant for speech , her countenance said much , as soon as she could catch his eye again .
austen	emma	at this moment mr. weston appeared at a little distance from the window , evidently on the watch . his wife gave him a look which invited him in ; and , while he was coming round , added , “ now , dearest emma , let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease , and incline him to be satisfied with the match . let us make the best of it—and , indeed , almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour . it is not a connexion to gratify ; but if mr. churchill does not feel that , why should we ? and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him , for frank , i mean , that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as i have always given her credit for—and still am disposed to give her credit for , in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right . and how much may be said in her situation for even that error ! ”
austen	emma	she would have been too happy but for poor harriet ; but every blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend , who must now be even excluded from hartfield . the delightful family party which emma was securing for herself , poor harriet must , in mere charitable caution , be kept at a distance from . she would be a loser in every way . emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment . in such a party , harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise ; but for the poor girl herself , it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment .
austen	emma	“ and mine , ” said mr. knightley warmly , “ is , that if he turn out any thing like it , he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing ! what ! at three-and-twenty to be the king of his company—the great man—the practised politician , who is to read every body ’ s character , and make every body ’ s talents conduce to the display of his own superiority ; to be dispensing his flatteries around , that he may make all appear like fools compared with himself ! my dear emma , your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came to the point . ”
austen	emma	she had hoped for an answer here—for a few words to say that her conduct was at least intelligible ; but he was silent ; and , as far as she could judge , deep in thought . at last , and tolerably in his usual tone , he said ,
austen	emma	a very proper compliment ! —and then follows the application , which i think , my dear harriet , you can not find much difficulty in comprehending . read it in comfort to yourself . there can be no doubt of its being written for you and to you . ”
austen	emma	he was gone immediately ; and emma soon saw him standing before miss fairfax , and talking to her ; but as to its effect on the young lady , as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them , exactly in front of miss fairfax , she could absolutely distinguish nothing .
austen	emma	he was in high spirits ; as ready to talk and laugh as ever , and seemed delighted to speak of his former visit , and recur to old stories : and he was not without agitation . it was not in his calmness that she read his comparative indifference . he was not calm ; his spirits were evidently fluttered ; there was restlessness about him . lively as he was , it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself ; but what decided her belief on the subject , was his staying only a quarter of an hour , and hurrying away to make other calls in highbury . “ he had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed—he had not stopped , he would not stop for more than a word—but he had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call , and much as he wished to stay longer at hartfield , he must hurry off. ” she had no doubt as to his being less in love—but neither his agitated spirits , nor his hurrying away , seemed like a perfect cure ; and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power , and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long .
austen	emma	“ good god ! ” cried emma , not attending to her.— “ mrs . smallridge , too ! jane actually on the point of going as governess ! what could he mean by such horrible indelicacy ? to suffer her to engage herself—to suffer her even to think of such a measure ! ”
austen	emma	“ i promise you to make none for myself , papa ; but i must , indeed , for other people . it is the greatest amusement in the world ! and after such success , you know ! —every body said that mr. weston would never marry again . oh dear , no ! mr. weston , who had been a widower so long , and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife , so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here , always acceptable wherever he went , always cheerful—mr . weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it . oh no ! mr. weston certainly would never marry again . some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed , and others of the son and the uncle not letting him . all manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject , but i believed none of it .
austen	emma	“ perhaps it is as well , ” said frank churchill , as he attended emma to her carriage . “ i must have asked miss fairfax , and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me , after yours . ”
austen	emma	mr. elton was the very person fixed on by emma for driving the young farmer out of harriet ’ s head . she thought it would be an excellent match ; and only too palpably desirable , natural , and probable , for her to have much merit in planning it . she feared it was what every body else must think of and predict . it was not likely , however , that any body should have equalled her in the date of the plan , as it had entered her brain during the very first evening of harriet ’ s coming to hartfield . the longer she considered it , the greater was her sense of its expediency . mr. elton ’ s situation was most suitable , quite the gentleman himself , and without low connexions ; at the same time , not of any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of harriet . he had a comfortable home for her , and emma imagined a very sufficient income ; for though the vicarage of highbury was not large , he was known to have some independent property ; and she thought very highly of him as a good-humoured , well-meaning , respectable young man , without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world .
austen	emma	smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first glancing towards miss fairfax ; but it was most prudent to avoid speech . he told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining-room—hated sitting long—was always the first to move when he could—that his father , mr. knightley , mr. cox , and mr. cole , were left very busy over parish business—that as long as he had staid , however , it had been pleasant enough , as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike , sensible men ; and spoke so handsomely of highbury altogether—thought it so abundant in agreeable families—that emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much . she questioned him as to the society in yorkshire—the extent of the neighbourhood about enscombe , and the sort ; and could make out from his answers that , as far as enscombe was concerned , there was very little going on , that their visitings were among a range of great families , none very near ; and that even when days were fixed , and invitations accepted , it was an even chance that mrs. churchill were not in health and spirits for going ; that they made a point of visiting no fresh person ; and that , though he had his separate engagements , it was not without difficulty , without considerable address _at_ _times_ , that he could get away , or introduce an acquaintance for a night .
austen	emma	“ i hope mrs. bates and miss fairfax are— ” “ very well , i am much obliged to you . my mother is delightfully well ; and jane caught no cold last night . how is mr. woodhouse ? —i am so glad to hear such a good account . mrs. weston told me you were here.—oh ! then , said i , i must run across , i am sure miss woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in ; my mother will be so very happy to see her—and now we are such a nice party , she can not refuse.— ‘ aye , pray do , ’ said mr. frank churchill , ‘ miss woodhouse ’ s opinion of the instrument will be worth having. ’ —but , said i , i shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me.— ‘ oh , ’ said he , ‘ wait half a minute , till i have finished my job ; ’ —for , would you believe it , miss woodhouse , there he is , in the most obliging manner in the world , fastening in the rivet of my mother ’ s spectacles.—the rivet came out , you know , this morning.—so very obliging ! —for my mother had no use of her spectacles—could not put them on . and , by the bye , every body ought to have two pair of spectacles ; they should indeed . jane said so . i meant to take them over to john saunders the first thing i did , but something or other hindered me all the morning ; first one thing , then another , there is no saying what , you know . at one time patty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping . oh , said i , patty do not come with your bad news to me . here is the rivet of your mistress ’ s spectacles out . then the baked apples came home , mrs. wallis sent them by her boy ; they are extremely civil and obliging to us , the wallises , always—i have heard some people say that mrs. wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer , but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them . and it can not be for the value of our custom now , for what is our consumption of bread , you know ? only three of us.—besides dear jane at present—and she really eats nothing—makes such a shocking breakfast , you would be quite frightened if you saw it . i dare not let my mother know how little she eats—so i say one thing and then i say another , and it passes off . but about the middle of the day she gets hungry , and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples , and they are extremely wholesome , for i took the opportunity the other day of asking mr. perry ; i happened to meet him in the street . not that i had any doubt before—i have so often heard mr. woodhouse recommend a baked apple . i believe it is the only way that mr. woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome . we have apple-dumplings , however , very often . patty makes an excellent apple-dumpling . well , mrs. weston , you have prevailed , i hope , and these ladies will oblige us . ”
austen	emma	he wanted her to look up and smile ; and having now brought herself not to smile too broadly—she did—cheerfully answering , “ you need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match . i think harriet is doing extremely well . _her_ connexions may be worse than _his_ . in respectability of character , there can be no doubt that they are . i have been silent from surprize merely , excessive surprize . you can not imagine how suddenly it has come on me ! how peculiarly unprepared i was ! —for i had reason to believe her very lately more determined against him , much more , than she was before . ”
austen	emma	“ you are expecting her again , you say , this morning ? ” “ almost every moment . she has been gone longer already than she intended. ” “ something has happened to delay her ; some visitors perhaps . ”
austen	emma	after a few minutes of entire silence between them , john knightley began with— “ i never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than mr. elton . it is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned . with men he can be rational and unaffected , but when he has ladies to please , every feature works . ”
austen	emma	“ you are so noble in your ideas ! ” “ and when is miss fairfax to leave you ? ” “ very soon , very soon , indeed ; that ’ s the worst of it . within a fortnight . mrs. smallridge is in a great hurry . my poor mother does not know how to bear it . so then , i try to put it out of her thoughts , and say , come ma ’ am , do not let us think about it any more . ”
austen	emma	“ i either depend more upon emma ’ s good sense than you do , or am more anxious for her present comfort ; for i can not lament the acquaintance . how well she looked last night ! ”
austen	emma	“ my emma , he means no such thing . he only means— ” “ he and i should differ very little in our estimation of the two , ” interrupted she , with a sort of serious smile— “ much less , perhaps , than he is aware of , if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject . ”
austen	emma	“ mrs . elton , i suppose , has been the person to whom miss fairfax owes— ” “ yes , our good mrs. elton . the most indefatigable , true friend . she would not take a denial . she would not let jane say , ‘ no ; ’ for when jane first heard of it , ( it was the day before yesterday , the very morning we were at donwell , ) when jane first heard of it , she was quite decided against accepting the offer , and for the reasons you mention ; exactly as you say , she had made up her mind to close with nothing till colonel campbell ’ s return , and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at present—and so she told mrs. elton over and over again—and i am sure i had no more idea that she would change her mind ! —but that good mrs. elton , whose judgment never fails her , saw farther than i did . it is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did , and refuse to take jane ’ s answer ; but she positively declared she would _not_ write any such denial yesterday , as jane wished her ; she would wait—and , sure enough , yesterday evening it was all settled that jane should go . quite a surprize to me ! i had not the least idea ! —jane took mrs. elton aside , and told her at once , that upon thinking over the advantages of mrs. smallridge ’ s situation , she had come to the resolution of accepting it.—i did not know a word of it till it was all settled . ”
austen	emma	“ pray , mr. knightley , ” said emma , who had been smiling to herself through a great part of this speech , “ how do you know that mr. martin did not speak yesterday ? ” “ certainly , ” replied he , surprized , “ i do not absolutely know it ; but it may be inferred . was not she the whole day with you ? ”
austen	emma	“ now , ” —said emma , when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates , — “ now mr. weston , do let me know what has happened. ” “ no , no , ” —he gravely replied.— “ don ’ t ask me . i promised my wife to leave it all to her . she will break it to you better than i can . do not be impatient , emma ; it will all come out too soon . ”
austen	emma	the pain of his continued residence in highbury , however , must certainly be lessened by his marriage . many vain solicitudes would be prevented—many awkwardnesses smoothed by it . a _mrs._ _elton_ would be an excuse for any change of intercourse ; former intimacy might sink without remark . it would be almost beginning their life of civility again .
austen	emma	and she talked in this way so long and successfully that , when forced to give her attention again to her father and sister , she had nothing worse to hear than isabella ’ s kind inquiry after jane fairfax ; and jane fairfax , though no great favourite with her in general , she was at that moment very happy to assist in praising .
austen	emma	“ oh ! ” she cried in evident embarrassment , “ it all meant nothing ; a mere joke among ourselves. ” “ the joke , ” he replied gravely , “ seemed confined to you and mr. churchill. ” he had hoped she would speak again , but she did not . she would rather busy herself about any thing than speak . he sat a little while in doubt . a variety of evils crossed his mind . interference—fruitless interference . emma ’ s confusion , and the acknowledged intimacy , seemed to declare her affection engaged . yet he would speak . he owed it to her , to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference , rather than her welfare ; to encounter any thing , rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause .
austen	emma	“ i am most happy to hear it—but only jane fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superior ! —and exactly emma ’ s age. ” this topic was discussed very happily , and others succeeded of similar moment , and passed away with similar harmony ; but the evening did not close without a little return of agitation . the gruel came and supplied a great deal to be said—much praise and many comments—undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution , and pretty severe philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerably ; —but , unfortunately , among the failures which the daughter had to instance , the most recent , and therefore most prominent , was in her own cook at south end , a young woman hired for the time , who never had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel , thin , but not too thin . often as she had wished for and ordered it , she had never been able to get any thing tolerable . here was a dangerous opening .
austen	emma	“ i not aware ! ” said jane , shaking her head ; “ dear mrs. elton , who can have thought of it as i have done ? ” “ but you have not seen so much of the world as i have . you do not know how many candidates there always are for the _first_ situations . i saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round maple grove . a cousin of mr. suckling , mrs. bragge , had such an infinity of applications ; every body was anxious to be in her family , for she moves in the first circle . wax-candles in the schoolroom ! you may imagine how desirable ! of all houses in the kingdom mrs. bragge ’ s is the one i would most wish to see you in . ”
austen	emma	“ whatever you say is always right , ” cried harriet , “ and therefore i suppose , and believe , and hope it must be so ; but otherwise i could not have imagined it . it is so much beyond any thing i deserve . mr. elton , who might marry any body ! there can not be two opinions about _him_ . he is so very superior . only think of those sweet verses— ‘ to miss ———. ’ dear me , how clever ! —could it really be meant for me ? ”
austen	emma	harriet looked grave . “ my dear harriet , you must not refine too much upon this charade.—you will betray your feelings improperly , if you are too conscious and too quick , and appear to affix more meaning , or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it . do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration . if he had been anxious for secrecy , he would not have left the paper while i was by ; but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you . do not let us be too solemn on the business . he has encouragement enough to proceed , without our sighing out our souls over this charade . ”
austen	emma	in the hope of diverting her father ’ s thoughts from the disagreeableness of mr. knightley ’ s going to london ; and going so suddenly ; and going on horseback , which she knew would be all very bad ; emma communicated her news of jane fairfax , and her dependence on the effect was justified ; it supplied a very useful check , —interested , without disturbing him . he had long made up his mind to jane fairfax ’ s going out as governess , and could talk of it cheerfully , but mr. knightley ’ s going to london had been an unexpected blow .
austen	emma	emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer , and advised its being written directly , which was agreed to , in the hope of her assistance ; and though emma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted , it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence . the looking over his letter again , in replying to it , had such a softening tendency , that it was particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions ; and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy , and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say , and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful , that emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment , he would have been accepted after all .
austen	emma	“ i was wrong , ” he continued , “ in talking of its being _broke_ to you . i should not have used the expression . in fact , it does not concern you—it concerns only myself , —that is , we hope.—humph ! —in short , my dear emma , there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it . i don ’ t say that it is not a disagreeable business—but things might be much worse.—if we walk fast , we shall soon be at randalls . ”
austen	emma	his eldest daughter ’ s alarm was equal to his own . the horror of being blocked up at randalls , while her children were at hartfield , was full in her imagination ; and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people , but in a state that admitted no delay , she was eager to have it settled , that her father and emma should remain at randalls , while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them .
austen	emma	she saw that enscombe could not satisfy , and that highbury , taken at its best , might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at home than he liked . his importance at enscombe was very evident . he did not boast , but it naturally betrayed itself , that he had persuaded his aunt where his uncle could do nothing , and on her laughing and noticing it , he owned that he believed ( excepting one or two points ) he could _with_ _time_ persuade her to any thing . one of those points on which his influence failed , he then mentioned . he had wanted very much to go abroad—had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel—but she would not hear of it . this had happened the year before . _now_ , he said , he was beginning to have no longer the same wish .
austen	emma	“ now , ma ’ am , ” said jane to her aunt , “ shall we join mrs. elton ? ” “ if you please , my dear . with all my heart . i am quite ready . i was ready to have gone with her , but this will do just as well . we shall soon overtake her . there she is—no , that ’ s somebody else . that ’ s one of the ladies in the irish car party , not at all like her.—well , i declare— ”
austen	emma	he had not left her long , by no means long enough for her to have the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else , when a letter was brought her from randalls—a very thick letter ; —she guessed what it must contain , and deprecated the necessity of reading it.—she was now in perfect charity with frank churchill ; she wanted no explanations , she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself—and as for understanding any thing he wrote , she was sure she was incapable of it.—it must be waded through , however . she opened the packet ; it was too surely so ; —a note from mrs. weston to herself , ushered in the letter from frank to mrs. weston .
austen	emma	she pondered , but could think of nothing . after a mutual silence of some minutes , harriet thus began again— “ i do so wonder , miss woodhouse , that you should not be married , or going to be married ! so charming as you are ! ” —
austen	emma	it was a great consolation that mr. elton should not be really in love with her , or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint him—that harriet ’ s nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive—and that there could be no necessity for any body ’ s knowing what had passed except the three principals , and especially for her father ’ s being given a moment ’ s uneasiness about it .
austen	emma	“ i can answer for every thing of that nature , sir , because it will be under mrs. weston ’ s care . mrs. weston undertakes to direct the whole. ” “ there , papa ! —now you must be satisfied—our own dear mrs. weston , who is carefulness itself . do not you remember what mr. perry said , so many years ago , when i had the measles ? ‘ if _miss_ _taylor_ undertakes to wrap miss emma up , you need not have any fears , sir. ’ how often have i heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her ! ”
austen	emma	“ you had better explore to donwell , ” replied mr. knightley . “ that may be done without horses . come , and eat my strawberries . they are ripening fast. ” if mr. knightley did not begin seriously , he was obliged to proceed so , for his proposal was caught at with delight ; and the “ oh ! i should like it of all things , ” was not plainer in words than manner . donwell was famous for its strawberry-beds , which seemed a plea for the invitation : but no plea was necessary ; cabbage-beds would have been enough to tempt the lady , who only wanted to be going somewhere . she promised him again and again to come—much oftener than he doubted—and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy , such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it .
austen	emma	“ but , my dear sir , ” cried mr. weston , “ if emma comes away early , it will be breaking up the party. ” “ and no great harm if it does , ” said mr. woodhouse . “ the sooner every party breaks up , the better . ”
austen	emma	“ you spent the evening with mrs. elton ? ” “ yes , all of us ; mrs. elton would have us come . it was settled so , upon the hill , while we were walking about with mr. knightley . ‘ you _must_ _all_ spend your evening with us , ’ said she— ‘ i positively must have you _all_ come . ’ ”
austen	emma	this wretched note was the finale of emma ’ s breakfast . when once it had been read , there was no doing any thing , but lament and exclaim . the loss of the ball—the loss of the young man—and all that the young man might be feeling ! —it was too wretched ! —such a delightful evening as it would have been ! —every body so happy ! and she and her partner the happiest ! — “ i said it would be so , ” was the only consolation .
austen	emma	it would be impossible to say what emma felt , on hearing this—which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost . she was too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply : and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for mr. elton ’ s sanguine state of mind , he tried to take her hand again , as he joyously exclaimed—
austen	emma	“ you will not ask me what is the point of envy.—you are determined , i see , to have no curiosity.—you are wise—but _i_ can not be wise . emma , i must tell you what you will not ask , though i may wish it unsaid the next moment . ”
austen	emma	“ i thank you ; but i assure you you are quite mistaken . mr. elton and i are very good friends , and nothing more ; ” and she walked on , amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances , of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into ; and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant , and in want of counsel . he said no more .
austen	emma	emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent , and answer in a manner that appropriated nothing . “ think of me to-morrow , my dear emma , about four o ’ clock , ” was mrs. weston ’ s parting injunction ; spoken with some anxiety , and meant only for her .
austen	emma	mrs. weston kissed her with tears of joy ; and when she could find utterance , assured her , that this protestation had done her more good than any thing else in the world could do .
austen	emma	she was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes , in talking and listening , and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens , that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate ; and the supper-table , which always closed such parties , and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time , was all set out and ready , and moved forwards to the fire , before she was aware . with an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively , with the real good-will of a mind delighted with its own ideas , did she then do all the honours of the meal , and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters , with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests .
austen	emma	“ i should not have thought it possible , ” she began , “ that you could have misunderstood me ! i know we agreed never to name him—but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else , i should not have thought it possible that i could be supposed to mean any other person . mr. frank churchill , indeed ! i do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other . i hope i have a better taste than to think of mr. frank churchill , who is like nobody by his side . and that you should have been so mistaken , is amazing ! —i am sure , but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment , i should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost , to dare to think of him . at first , if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened ; that there had been matches of greater disparity ( those were your very words ) ; —i should not have dared to give way to—i should not have thought it possible—but if _you_ , who had been always acquainted with him— ”
austen	emma	the child to be born at randalls must be a tie there even dearer than herself ; and mrs. weston ’ s heart and time would be occupied by it . they should lose her ; and , probably , in great measure , her husband also.—frank churchill would return among them no more ; and miss fairfax , it was reasonable to suppose , would soon cease to belong to highbury . they would be married , and settled either at or near enscombe . all that were good would be withdrawn ; and if to these losses , the loss of donwell were to be added , what would remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach ? mr. knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort ! —no longer walking in at all hours , as if ever willing to change his own home for their ’ s ! —how was it to be endured ? and if he were to be lost to them for harriet ’ s sake ; if he were to be thought of hereafter , as finding in harriet ’ s society all that he wanted ; if harriet were to be the chosen , the first , the dearest , the friend , the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence ; what could be increasing emma ’ s wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind , that it had been all her own work ?
austen	emma	mrs. bates , the widow of a former vicar of highbury , was a very old lady , almost past every thing but tea and quadrille . she lived with her single daughter in a very small way , and was considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady , under such untoward circumstances , can excite . her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young , handsome , rich , nor married . miss bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour ; and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself , or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect . she had never boasted either beauty or cleverness . her youth had passed without distinction , and her middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother , and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible . and yet she was a happy woman , and a woman whom no one named without good-will . it was her own universal good-will and contented temper which worked such wonders . she loved every body , was interested in every body ’ s happiness , quicksighted to every body ’ s merits ; thought herself a most fortunate creature , and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother , and so many good neighbours and friends , and a home that wanted for nothing . the simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature , her contented and grateful spirit , were a recommendation to every body , and a mine of felicity to herself . she was a great talker upon little matters , which exactly suited mr. woodhouse , full of trivial communications and harmless gossip .
austen	emma	it was most convenient to emma not to make a direct reply to this assertion ; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again . “ you are a very warm friend to mr. martin ; but , as i said before , are unjust to harriet . harriet ’ s claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them . she is not a clever girl , but she has better sense than you are aware of , and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly . waiving that point , however , and supposing her to be , as you describe her , only pretty and good-natured , let me tell you , that in the degree she possesses them , they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general , for she is , in fact , a beautiful girl , and must be thought so by ninety-nine people out of an hundred ; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed ; till they do fall in love with well-informed minds instead of handsome faces , a girl , with such loveliness as harriet , has a certainty of being admired and sought after , of having the power of chusing from among many , consequently a claim to be nice . her good-nature , too , is not so very slight a claim , comprehending , as it does , real , thorough sweetness of temper and manner , a very humble opinion of herself , and a great readiness to be pleased with other people . i am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty , and such temper , the highest claims a woman could possess . ”
austen	emma	“ don ’ t class us together , harriet . my playing is no more like her ’ s , than a lamp is like sunshine. ” “ oh ! dear—i think you play the best of the two . i think you play quite as well as she does . i am sure i had much rather hear you . every body last night said how well you played . ”
austen	emma	_her_ change was equal.—this one half-hour had given to each the same precious certainty of being beloved , had cleared from each the same degree of ignorance , jealousy , or distrust.—on his side , there had been a long-standing jealousy , old as the arrival , or even the expectation , of frank churchill.—he had been in love with emma , and jealous of frank churchill , from about the same period , one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other . it was his jealousy of frank churchill that had taken him from the country.—the box hill party had decided him on going away . he would save himself from witnessing again such permitted , encouraged attentions.—he had gone to learn to be indifferent.—but he had gone to a wrong place . there was too much domestic happiness in his brother ’ s house ; woman wore too amiable a form in it ; isabella was too much like emma—differing only in those striking inferiorities , which always brought the other in brilliancy before him , for much to have been done , even had his time been longer.—he had stayed on , however , vigorously , day after day—till this very morning ’ s post had conveyed the history of jane fairfax.—then , with the gladness which must be felt , nay , which he did not scruple to feel , having never believed frank churchill to be at all deserving emma , was there so much fond solicitude , so much keen anxiety for her , that he could stay no longer . he had ridden home through the rain ; and had walked up directly after dinner , to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures , faultless in spite of all her faults , bore the discovery .
austen	emma	chapter xv mr. woodhouse was soon ready for his tea ; and when he had drank his tea he was quite ready to go home ; and it was as much as his three companions could do , to entertain away his notice of the lateness of the hour , before the other gentlemen appeared . mr. weston was chatty and convivial , and no friend to early separations of any sort ; but at last the drawing-room party did receive an augmentation . mr. elton , in very good spirits , was one of the first to walk in . mrs. weston and emma were sitting together on a sofa . he joined them immediately , and , with scarcely an invitation , seated himself between them .
austen	emma	“ well , ” said she at last , trying to recover herself ; “ this is a circumstance which i must think of at least half a day , before i can at all comprehend it . what ! —engaged to her all the winter—before either of them came to highbury ? ”
austen	emma	“ oh ! very well , ” exclaimed miss bates , “ then i need not be uneasy . ‘ three things very dull indeed. ’ that will just do for me , you know . i shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever i open my mouth , shan ’ t i ? ( looking round with the most good-humoured dependence on every body ’ s assent ) —do not you all think i shall ? ”
austen	emma	such an adventure as this , —a fine young man and a lovely young woman thrown together in such a way , could hardly fail of suggesting certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain . so emma thought , at least . could a linguist , could a grammarian , could even a mathematician have seen what she did , have witnessed their appearance together , and heard their history of it , without feeling that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other ? —how much more must an imaginist , like herself , be on fire with speculation and foresight ! —especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made .
austen	emma	a very friendly shake of the hand , a very earnest “ good-bye , ” closed the speech , and the door had soon shut out frank churchill . short had been the notice—short their meeting ; he was gone ; and emma felt so sorry to part , and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry , and feeling it too much .
austen	emma	with great indignation did he continue to observe him ; with great alarm and distrust , to observe also his two blinded companions . he saw a short word prepared for emma , and given to her with a look sly and demure . he saw that emma had soon made it out , and found it highly entertaining , though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure ; for she said , “ nonsense ! for shame ! ” he heard frank churchill next say , with a glance towards jane , “ i will give it to her—shall i ? ” —and as clearly heard emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth . “ no , no , you must not ; you shall not , indeed . ”
austen	emma	emma found that she must wait ; and now it required little effort . she asked no more questions therefore , merely employed her own fancy , and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money concern—something just come to light , of a disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the family , —something which the late event at richmond had brought forward . her fancy was very active . half a dozen natural children , perhaps—and poor frank cut off ! —this , though very undesirable , would be no matter of agony to her . it inspired little more than an animating curiosity .
austen	emma	“ i should have been sorry , mr. knightley , to be dependent on _your_ recommendation , had i quitted mr. woodhouse ’ s family and wanted another situation ; i do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body . i am sure you always thought me unfit for the office i held . ”
austen	emma	chapter xii one thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely satisfactory to emma—its being fixed for a day within the granted term of frank churchill ’ s stay in surry ; for , in spite of mr. weston ’ s confidence , she could not think it so very impossible that the churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his fortnight . but this was not judged feasible . the preparations must take their time , nothing could be properly ready till the third week were entered on , and for a few days they must be planning , proceeding and hoping in uncertainty—at the risk—in her opinion , the great risk , of its being all in vain .
austen	emma	“ i have not a fault to find with her person , ” he replied . “ i think her all you describe . i love to look at her ; and i will add this praise , that i do not think her personally vain . considering how very handsome she is , she appears to be little occupied with it ; her vanity lies another way . mrs. weston , i am not to be talked out of my dislike of harriet smith , or my dread of its doing them both harm . ”
austen	emma	“ well , sir , ” cried mr. weston , “ as i took miss taylor away , it is incumbent on me to supply her place , if i can ; and i will step to mrs. goddard in a moment , if you wish it . ”
austen	emma	“ my father and mrs. weston are at the crown at this moment , ” said frank churchill , “ examining the capabilities of the house . i left them there and came on to hartfield , impatient for your opinion , and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot . i was desired to say so from both . it would be the greatest pleasure to them , if you could allow me to attend you there . they can do nothing satisfactorily without you . ”
austen	emma	such expressions , assisted as they were by every thing that look and manner could do , made emma feel that she had never loved harriet so well , nor valued her affection so highly before .
austen	emma	mr. elton was only too happy . harriet listened , and emma drew in peace . she must allow him to be still frequently coming to look ; any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover ; and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil , to jump up and see the progress , and be charmed.—there was no being displeased with such an encourager , for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible . she could not respect his eye , but his love and his complaisance were unexceptionable .
austen	emma	“ such an imagination has crossed me , i own , emma ; and if it never occurred to you before , you may as well take it into consideration now. ” “ mr . elton in love with me ! —what an idea ! ”
austen	emma	“ we can not suppose , ” said emma , smiling , “ that mr. elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a _very_ musical society in highbury ; and i hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned , in consideration of the motive . ”
austen	emma	he remained at hartfield after all the rest , his thoughts full of what he had seen ; so full , that when the candles came to assist his observations , he must—yes , he certainly must , as a friend—an anxious friend—give emma some hint , ask her some question . he could not see her in a situation of such danger , without trying to preserve her . it was his duty .
austen	emma	“ i know nothing of the large parties of london , sir—i never dine with any body. ” “ indeed ! ( in a tone of wonder and pity , ) i had no idea that the law had been so great a slavery . well , sir , the time must come when you will be paid for all this , when you will have little labour and great enjoyment . ”
austen	emma	a reasonable visit paid , mr. weston began to move.— “ he must be going . he had business at the crown about his hay , and a great many errands for mrs. weston at ford ’ s , but he need not hurry any body else. ” his son , too well bred to hear the hint , rose immediately also , saying ,
austen	emma	“ that you do not give another half-second to the subject . to hartfield , if you please , mrs. ford. ” “ aye , that will be much best , ” said harriet , quite satisfied , “ i should not at all like to have it sent to mrs. goddard ’ s . ”
austen	emma	“ to be sure . yes . not that i think mr. martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education—and been very well brought up . however , i do not mean to set up my opinion against yours—and i am sure i shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife . i shall always have a great regard for the miss martins , especially elizabeth , and should be very sorry to give them up , for they are quite as well educated as me . but if he marries a very ignorant , vulgar woman , certainly i had better not visit her , if i can help it . ”
austen	emma	mr. knightley was thoughtful again . the result of his reverie was , “ no , emma , i do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize.—i never had a thought of her in that way , i assure you. ” and soon afterwards , “ jane fairfax is a very charming young woman—but not even jane fairfax is perfect . she has a fault . she has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife . ”
austen	emma	the symptoms were favourable.—instead of answering , harriet turned away confused , and stood thoughtfully by the fire ; and though the letter was still in her hand , it was now mechanically twisted about without regard . emma waited the result with impatience , but not without strong hopes . at last , with some hesitation , harriet said—
austen	emma	some laughed , and answered good-humouredly . miss bates said a great deal ; mrs. elton swelled at the idea of miss woodhouse ’ s presiding ; mr. knightley ’ s answer was the most distinct . “ is miss woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of ? ”
austen	emma	“ oh ! no , ” said he ; “ it would be the extreme of imprudence . i could not bear it for emma ! —emma is not strong . she would catch a dreadful cold . so would poor little harriet . so you would all . mrs. weston , you would be quite laid up ; do not let them talk of such a wild thing . pray do not let them talk of it . that young man ( speaking lower ) is very thoughtless . do not tell his father , but that young man is not quite the thing . he has been opening the doors very often this evening , and keeping them open very inconsiderately . he does not think of the draught . i do not mean to set you against him , but indeed he is not quite the thing ! ”
austen	emma	he went to highbury the next morning , and satisfied himself on that point . he told her the news . was not she like a daughter , his eldest daughter ? —he must tell her ; and miss bates being present , it passed , of course , to mrs. cole , mrs. perry , and mrs. elton , immediately afterwards . it was no more than the principals were prepared for ; they had calculated from the time of its being known at randalls , how soon it would be over highbury ; and were thinking of themselves , as the evening wonder in many a family circle , with great sagacity .
austen	emma	emma returned her friend ’ s pressure with interest ; and was pleased enough to exclaim , “ you are not vain , mr. knightley . i will say that for you. ” he seemed hardly to hear her ; he was thoughtful—and in a manner which shewed him not pleased , soon afterwards said ,
austen	emma	“ exactly so ; that is what principally strikes me . so much superadded decision of character ! skilful has been the hand ! ” “ great has been the pleasure , i am sure . i never met with a disposition more truly amiable . ”
austen	emma	“ you take up an idea , mrs. weston , and run away with it ; as you have many a time reproached me with doing . i see no sign of attachment—i believe nothing of the pianoforte—and proof only shall convince me that mr. knightley has any thought of marrying jane fairfax . ”
austen	emma	“ thank you , dear miss woodhouse . yes , indeed , there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it . except the sucklings and bragges , there is not such another nursery establishment , so liberal and elegant , in all mrs. elton ’ s acquaintance . mrs. smallridge , a most delightful woman ! —a style of living almost equal to maple grove—and as to the children , except the little sucklings and little bragges , there are not such elegant sweet children anywhere . jane will be treated with such regard and kindness ! —it will be nothing but pleasure , a life of pleasure.—and her salary ! —i really can not venture to name her salary to you , miss woodhouse . even you , used as you are to great sums , would hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like jane . ”
austen	pride	she retreated from the window , fearful of being seen ; and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse .
austen	pride	“ if you _will_ thank me , ” he replied , “ let it be for yourself alone . that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on , i shall not attempt to deny . but your _family_ owe me nothing . much as i respect them , i believe i thought only of _you_ . ”
austen	pride	mr. collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed . he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way . his regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mother ’ s reproach prevented his feeling any regret .
austen	pride	“ and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ; but i am an idle fellow ; and though i have not many , i have more than i ever looked into . ”
austen	pride	“ i see what you are feeling , ” replied charlotte ; “ you must be surprised , very much surprised , so lately as mr. collins was wishing to marry you . but when you have had time to think it all over , i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done . i am not romantic , you know . i never was . i ask only a comfortable home ; and , considering mr. collins ’ s character , connections , and situation in life , i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state . ”
austen	pride	elizabeth could not oppose such a wish ; and from this time mr. bingley ’ s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them . mrs. bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more ; and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity . her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day . mrs. bennet ’ s best comfort was , that mr. bingley must be down again in the summer .
austen	pride	“ i do not know : i hope there was . but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult . my mother was in hysterics ; and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done . but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties . ”
austen	pride	“ they are generally long ; but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine. ” “ it is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter with ease can not write ill . ”
austen	pride	“ but it is fortunate , ” thought she , “ that i have something to wish for . were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain . but here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister ’ s absence , i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized . a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation . ”
austen	pride	elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards , and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr. wickham ’ s attentions . there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs. philips ’ s supper party , but his manners recommended him to everybody . whatever he said , was said well ; and whatever he did , done gracefully . elizabeth went away with her head full of him . she could think of nothing but of mr. wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither lydia nor mr. collins were once silent . lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won ; and mr. collins , in describing the civility of mr. and mrs. philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house .
austen	pride	“ how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning , mr. darcy , ” she cried : “ i never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter . she is grown so brown and coarse ! louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again . ”
austen	pride	as mrs. gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to london at the same time that mr. bennet came from it . the coach , therefore , took them the first stage of their journey , and brought its master back to longbourn .
austen	pride	to this , mary very gravely replied , “ far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures . they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds . but i confess they would have no charms for _me_ . i should infinitely prefer a book . ”
austen	pride	her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy . jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window -- she looked -- she saw mr. darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister .
austen	pride	mrs. reynolds ’ respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master . “ does that young lady know mr. darcy ? ” elizabeth coloured , and said , “ a little. ” “ and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , ma ’ am ? ”
austen	pride	“ money ! my uncle ! ” cried jane , “ what do you mean , sir ? ” “ i mean that no man in his proper senses would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life , and fifty after i am gone . ”
austen	pride	“ she is tolerable ” 15
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ but perhaps you would like to read it ” [ _copyright 1894 by george allen._ ] ] “ then it is as i always hoped , ” cried jane : “ they are married ! ” elizabeth read on : “ i have seen them both . they are not married , nor can i find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side , i hope it will not be long before they are . all that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum . these are conditions which , considering everything , i had no hesitation in complying with , as far as i thought myself privileged , for you . i shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer . you will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that mr. wickham ’ s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be . the world has been deceived in that respect ; and i am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune . if , as i conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business , i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement . there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ; therefore stay quietly at longbourn , and depend on my diligence and care . send back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to write explicitly . we have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house , of which i hope you will approve . she comes to us to-day . i shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on . yours , etc .
austen	pride	“ oh , do not repeat what i then said . these recollections will not do at all . i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it. ” darcy mentioned his letter . “ did it , ” said he , -- “ did it _soon_ make you think better of me ? did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ? ”
austen	pride	“ are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? ” “ both , ” replied elizabeth archly ; “ for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds . we are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the _éclat_ of a proverb . ”
austen	pride	“ my dearest lizzy will , i am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expense , when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingley ’ s regard for me . but , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if i still assert that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion . i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me ; but , if the same circumstances were to happen again , i am sure i should be deceived again . caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did i receive in the meantime . when she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal apology for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was , in every respect , so altered a creature , that when she went away i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer . i pity , though i can not help blaming , her . she was very wrong in singling me out as she did ; i can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side . but i pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it . i need not explain myself farther ; and though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable . i can not but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago . he knows of my being in town , i am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it would seem , by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy . i can not understand it . if i were not afraid of judging harshly , i should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this . i will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt . let me hear from you very soon . miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty . we had better not mention it . i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford . pray go to see them , with sir william and maria . i am sure you will be very comfortable there .
austen	pride	“ certainly , sir ; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world : every savage can dance. ” sir william only smiled . “ your friend performs delightfully , ” he continued , after a pause , on seeing bingley join the group ; “ and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , mr. darcy . ”
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ tenderly flirting ” [ _copyright 1894 by george allen._ ] ] had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ? they could have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the same . lydia ’ s going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband ’ s never intending to go there himself .
austen	pride	she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to elizabeth ’ s salutation than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word . elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship ’ s entrance , though no request of introduction had been made .
austen	pride	they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching : but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene . her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house , whichever it might be , where mr. darcy then was . she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of everything , she was still dear to him . perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been _that_ in his voice , which was not like ease . whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure .
austen	pride	tailpiece to chapter v. 26
austen	pride	“ removed ! ” cried bingley . “ it must not be thought of . my sister , i am sure , will not hear of her removal. ” “ you may depend upon it , madam , ” said miss bingley , with cold civility , “ that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us . ”
austen	pride	“ this was a lucky idea of mine , indeed ! ” said mrs. bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own . till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance . breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth : --
austen	pride	darcy was fixed in astonishment . “ when i consider , ” she added , in a yet more agitated voice , “ that _i_ might have prevented it ! _i_ who knew what he was . had i but explained some part of it only -- some part of what i learnt , to my own family ! had his character been known , this could not have happened . but it is all , all too late now . ”
austen	pride	“ my object _then_ , ” replied darcy , “ was to show you , by every civility in my power , that i was not so mean as to resent the past ; and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to . how soon any other wishes introduced themselves , i can hardly tell , but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you . ”
austen	pride	“ the letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , i hope , quite so easily changed as that implies . ”
austen	pride	elizabeth ’ s mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view . they gradually ascended for half a mile , and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house , situated on the opposite side of the valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound . it was a large , handsome stone building , standing well on rising ground , and backed by a ridge of high woody hills ; and in front a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater , but without any artificial appearance . its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned . elizabeth was delighted . she had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste . they were all of them warm in their admiration ; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of pemberley might be something !
austen	pride	mrs. bennet was , in fact , too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent . in the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that mr. collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and , fourthly , that the match might be broken off . two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole : one , that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day . nothing could console and nothing appease her . nor did that day wear out her resentment . a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her : a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude ; and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter .
austen	pride	“ it is _your_ turn to say something now , mr. darcy . _i_ talked about the dance , and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples . ”
austen	pride	after amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained : -- “ about a month ago i received this letter , and about a fortnight ago i answered it ; for i thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention . it is from my cousin , mr. collins , who , when i am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases . ”
austen	pride	“ but upon my honour i do _not_ . i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _that_ . tease calmness of temper and presence of mind ! no , no ; i feel he may defy us there . and as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject . mr. darcy may hug himself . ”
austen	pride	“ no , no . you forced me into visiting him last year , and promised , if i went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters . but it ended in nothing , and i will not be sent on a fool ’ s errand again . ”
austen	pride	“ oh ! where , where is my uncle ? ” cried elizabeth , darting from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without losing a moment of the time so precious ; but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and mr. darcy appeared . her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia ’ s situation , hastily exclaimed , “ i beg your pardon , but i must leave you . i must find mr. gardiner this moment on business that can not be delayed ; i have not an instant to lose . ”
austen	pride	“ i believe she did -- and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object. ” “ mr . collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife . ”
austen	pride	“ yes , ma ’ am , all. ” “ all ! what , all five out at once ? very odd ! and you only the second . the younger ones out before the elder are married ! your younger sisters must be very young ? ”
austen	pride	“ yes , ” replied darcy , who could contain himself no longer , “ but _that_ was only when i first knew her ; for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . ”
austen	pride	elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister ’ s ready acquiescence . “ i hope , ” added mrs. gardiner , “ that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her . we live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her . ”
austen	pride	their reception from mr. bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial . his countenance rather gained in austerity ; and he scarcely opened his lips . the easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him .
austen	pride	her aunt assured her that she was ; and elizabeth , having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted , -- a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented .
austen	pride	“ that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask . a lady ’ s imagination is very rapid ; it jumps from admiration to love , from love to matrimony , in a moment . i knew you would be wishing me joy . ”
austen	pride	jane had already written a few lines to her sister , to announce their safe arrival in london ; and when she wrote again , elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys .
austen	pride	from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr. darcy had been overrated , elizabeth had never yet answered mrs. gardiner ’ s long letter ; but now , having _that_ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows : --
austen	pride	“ while i can have my mornings to myself , ” said she , “ it is enough . i think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements . society has claims on us all ; and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody . ”
austen	pride	“ and if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice . i do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr. darcy . ”
austen	pride	“ nay , ” cried bingley , “ this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning . and yet , upon my honour , i believed what i said of myself to be true , and i believe it at this moment . at least , therefore , i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies . ”
austen	pride	“ piling up the fire ” 69
austen	pride	“ his parting obeisance ” 261
austen	pride	“ we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us , ” said mrs. gardiner ; “ but perhaps , to the lakes. ” no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful . “ my dear , dear aunt , ” she rapturously cried , “ what delight ! what felicity ! you give me fresh life and vigour . adieu to disappointment and spleen . what are men to rocks and mountains ? oh , what hours of transport we shall spend ! and when we _do_ return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one accurate idea of anything . we _will_ know where we have gone -- we _will_ recollect what we have seen . lakes , mountains , and rivers , shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations ; nor , when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation . let _our_ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers . ”
austen	pride	“ my dearest sister , now be , _be_ serious . i want to talk very seriously . let me know everything that i am to know without delay . will you tell me how long you have loved him ? ”
austen	pride	mr. bingley arrived . mrs. bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side be as long as it could . she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent -- hopeless of seeing him before . but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire , she saw him from her dressing-room window enter the paddock , and ride towards the house .
austen	pride	[ illustration : cheerful prognostics ] “ they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them. ” “ but if you have got them to-day , ” said elizabeth , “ my mother ’ s purpose will be answered . ”
austen	pride	“ i beg you will not put it into lizzy ’ s head to be vexed by his ill-treatment , for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him . mrs. long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips . ”
austen	pride	title-page v
austen	pride	elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make mr. darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot .
austen	pride	“ but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , ” replied her uncle . “ your great men often are ; and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . ”
austen	pride	mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs. bennet ’ s being quite unable to sit alone . mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters ’ beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance .
austen	pride	“ and do you impute it to either of those ? ” “ yes ; to the last . but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem . stop me , whilst you can . ”
austen	pride	mrs. bennet rang the bell , and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library . “ come here , child , ” cried her father as she appeared . “ i have sent for you on an affair of importance . i understand that mr. collins has made you an offer of marriage . is it true ? ”
austen	pride	“ miss bennet , there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn . i should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company . ”
austen	pride	“ this is no very striking resemblance of your own character , i am sure , ” said he . “ how near it may be to _mine_ , i can not pretend to say . _you_ think it a faithful portrait , undoubtedly . ”
austen	pride	“ my dear miss elizabeth , i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy ; for , give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom -- provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained . you must , therefore , allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which lead me to perform what i look on as a point of duty . pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself ; ” and with a low bow he left her to attack mr. darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident . her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words “ apology , ” “ hunsford , ” and “ lady catherine de bourgh. ” it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man . mr. darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder ; and when at last mr. collins allowed him to speak , replied with an air of distant civility . mr. collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and mr. darcy ’ s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech ; and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way : mr. collins then returned to elizabeth .
austen	pride	when tea was over mr. hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table -- but in vain . she had obtained private intelligence that mr. darcy did not wish for cards , and mr. hurst soon found even his open petition rejected . she assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her . mr. hurst had , therefore , nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep . darcy took up a book . miss bingley did the same ; and mrs. hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brother ’ s conversation with miss bennet .
austen	pride	lydia ’ s voice was heard in the vestibule ; the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room . her mother stepped forwards , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham , who followed his lady ; and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which showed no doubt of their happiness .
austen	pride	“ what think you of books ? ” said he , smiling . “ books -- oh no ! -- i am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings. ” “ i am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject . we may compare our different opinions . ”
austen	pride	“ mrs . bennet and her two youngest girls ” 53
austen	pride	“ not so hasty , if you please . i have by no means done . to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add . i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister ’ s infamous elopement . i know it all ; that the young man ’ s marrying her was a patched-up business , at the expense of your father and uncle . and is _such_ a girl to be my nephew ’ s sister ? is _her_ husband , who is the son of his late father ’ s steward , to be his brother ? heaven and earth ! -- of what are you thinking ? are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted ? ”
austen	pride	“ by the bye charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield ? i would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure . ”
austen	pride	“ o that my dear mother had more command over herself ! she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him . but i will not repine . it can not last long . he will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before . ”
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ will you come and see me ? ” ] chapter xxvi . [ illustration ] mrs. gardiner ’ s caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone : after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on : --
austen	pride	“ i would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone ; but i always speak what i think. ” “ i know you do : and it is _that_ which makes the wonder . with _your_ good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others ! affectation of candour is common enough ; one meets with it everywhere . but to be candid without ostentation or design , -- to take the good of everybody ’ s character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad , -- belongs to you alone . and so , you like this man ’ s sisters , too , do you ? their manners are not equal to his . ”
austen	pride	“ oh , ” said lydia , stoutly , “ i am not afraid ; for though i _am_ the youngest , i ’ m the tallest. ” the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr. bennet ’ s visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner .
austen	pride	“ when the party entered ” 12
austen	pride	“ i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation , ” replied elizabeth ; “ but it is not in my power to accept it . i must be in town next saturday . ”
austen	pride	“ the efforts of his aunt ” 448
austen	pride	“ i am astonished , my dear , ” said mrs. bennet , “ that you should be so ready to think your own children silly . if i wished to think slightingly of anybody ’ s children , it should not be of my own , however . ”
austen	pride	but elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and , having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice . the two first dances , however , brought a return of distress : they were dances of mortification . mr. collins , awkward and solemn , apologizing instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give . the moment of her release from him was ecstasy .
austen	pride	“ i am sure there is not on _his_ . i will answer for it , he never cared three straws about her . who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled thing ? ” elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of _expression_ herself , the coarseness of the _sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal !
austen	pride	then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , “ unhappy as the event must be for lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson : -- that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable , that one false step involves her in endless ruin , that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful , and that she can not be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . ”
austen	pride	elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case . “ then who taught you ? who attended to you ? without a governess , you must have been neglected . ”
austen	pride	“ do you suppose them to be in london ? ” “ yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ? ” “ and lydia used to want to go to london , ” added kitty . “ she is happy , then , ” said her father , drily ; “ and her residence there will probably be of some duration . ”
austen	pride	“ oh ! my dear father , ” she cried , “ come back and write immediately . consider how important every moment is in such a case. ” “ let me write for you , ” said jane , “ if you dislike the trouble yourself . ”
austen	pride	“ well , ” cried her mother , “ it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ? if he had not had a family of his own , i and my children must have had all his money , you know ; and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him except a few presents . well ! i am so happy . in a short time , i shall have a daughter married . mrs. wickham ! how well it sounds ! and she was only sixteen last june . my dear jane , i am in such a flutter , that i am sure i can ’ t write ; so i will dictate , and you write for me . we will settle with your father about the money afterwards ; but the things should be ordered immediately . ”
austen	pride	elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt . their first subject was her sister ; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute inquiries , that though jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were periods of dejection . it was reasonable , however , to hope that they would not continue long . mrs. gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingley ’ s visit in gracechurch street , and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance .
austen	pride	“ i believe , ma ’ am , i may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him. ” “ his pride , ” said miss lucas , “ does not offend _me_ so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it . one can not wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , everything in his favour , should think highly of himself . if i may so express it , he has a _right_ to be proud . ”
austen	pride	“ i must think your language too strong in speaking of both , ” replied jane ; “ and i hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together . but enough of this . you alluded to something else . you mentioned _two_ instances . i can not misunderstand you , but i entreat you , dear lizzy , not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk . we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured . we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect . it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us . women fancy admiration means more than it does . ”
austen	pride	elizabeth ’ s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hour ’ s quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure . everything was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed tranquilly away ; there was no longer anything material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time .
austen	pride	“ to make herself agreeable to all ” 321
austen	pride	but on her returning to the drawing-room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her . on opening the door , she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth , as if engaged in earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both , as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other , would have told it all . _their_ situation was awkward enough ; but _hers_ she thought was still worse . not a syllable was uttered by either ; and elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and , whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room .
austen	pride	“ it was greatly my wish that he should do so , ” he added , “ as soon as his marriage was fixed on . and i think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece ’ s . it is mr. wickham ’ s intention to go into the regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army . he has the promise of an ensigncy in general -- -- ’ s regiment , now quartered in the north . it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom . he promises fairly ; and i hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent . i have written to colonel forster , to inform him of our present arrangements , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr. wickham in and near brighton with assurances of speedy payment , for which i have pledged myself . and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton , of whom i shall subjoin a list , according to his information ? he has given in all his debts ; i hope at least he has not deceived us . haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week . they will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to longbourn ; and i understand from mrs. gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south . she is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother. -- yours , etc .
austen	pride	she had not been many hours at home , before she found that the brighton scheme , of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents . elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal , that her mother , though often disheartened , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last .
austen	pride	she had instinctively turned away ; but stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome . had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr. darcy , the gardener ’ s expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it . they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family . amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life . nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ; and he repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn , and of her stay in derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts .
austen	pride	it was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ; and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , “ say nothing of that . who should suffer but myself ? it has been my own doing , and i ought to feel it . ”
austen	pride	mrs. gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend , that had attended her from that part of the world . his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ; and the kind of half-expectation which mrs. gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing . elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from pemberley .
austen	pride	with a stronger voice she soon added , “ i have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself . ”
austen	pride	in another minute mr. bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend . mr. denny and mr. wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr. philips ’ s house , and then made their bows , in spite of miss lydia ’ s pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of mrs. philips ’ s throwing up the parlour window , and loudly seconding the invitation .
austen	pride	“ i shall be very fit to see jane -- which is all i want. ” “ is this a hint to me , lizzy , ” said her father , “ to send for the horses ? ” “ no , indeed . i do not wish to avoid the walk . the distance is nothing , when one has a motive ; only three miles . i shall be back by dinner . ”
austen	pride	“ in conversation with the ladies ” 198
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ protested that he never read novels ” h.t feb 94 ] to read aloud to the ladies . mr. collins readily assented , and a book was produced ; but on beholding it ( for everything announced it to be from a circulating library ) he started back , and , begging pardon , protested that he never read novels . kitty stared at him , and lydia exclaimed . other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose “ fordyce ’ s sermons. ” lydia gaped as he opened the volume ; and before he had , with very monotonous solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with , --
austen	pride	her carriage remained at the door , and elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it . they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse ; elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable .
austen	pride	“ yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had . my friend has an excellent understanding -- though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr. collins as the wisest thing she ever did . she seems perfectly happy , however ; and , in a prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for her . ”
austen	pride	this was a lucky recollection -- it saved her from something like regret . she longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it . at length , however , the question was asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm , while mrs. reynolds replied , that he was ; adding , “ but we expect him to-morrow , with a large party of friends. ” how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day !
austen	pride	“ poor wickham ! there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance ! such an openness and gentleness in his manner. ” “ there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men . one has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it . ”
austen	pride	“ my dear jane , make haste and hurry down . he is come -- mr. bingley is come . he is , indeed . make haste , make haste . here , sarah , come to miss bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown . never mind miss lizzy ’ s hair . ”
austen	pride	“ edw . gardiner. ” “ is it possible ? ” cried elizabeth , when she had finished . “ can it be possible that he will marry her ? ” “ wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him , ” said her sister . “ my dear father , i congratulate you . ”
austen	pride	“ indeed i do not dare. ” elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody , and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her . he really believed that , were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger .
austen	pride	she highly approved his forbearance ; and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendations which they civilly bestowed on each other , as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn , and during the walk he particularly attended to her . his accompanying them was a double advantage : she felt all the compliment it offered to herself ; and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother .
austen	pride	“ and yours , ” he replied , with a smile , “ is wilfully to misunderstand them. ” “ do let us have a little music , ” cried miss bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share . “ louisa , you will not mind my waking mr. hurst . ”
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ on looking up ” ] chapter xxxiii . [ illustration ] more than once did elizabeth , in her ramble within the park , unexpectedly meet mr. darcy . she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought ; and , to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him , at first , that it was a favourite haunt of hers . how it could occur a second time , therefore , was very odd ! yet it did , and even the third . it seemed like wilful ill-nature , or a voluntary penance ; for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her . he never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third rencounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questions -- about her pleasure in being at hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of mr. and mrs. collins ’ s happiness ; and that in speaking of rosings , and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying _there_ too . his words seemed to imply it . could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts ? she supposed , if he meant anything , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter . it distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage .
austen	pride	“ my dear jane , ” exclaimed elizabeth , “ you are too good . your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic ; i do not know what to say to you . i feel as if i had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve . ”
austen	pride	the rapture of lydia on this occasion , her adoration of mrs. forster , the delight of mrs. bennet , and the mortification of kitty , are scarcely to be described . wholly inattentive to her sister ’ s feelings , lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy , calling for everyone ’ s congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish .
austen	pride	mr. gardiner soon wrote again to his brother . to mr. bennet ’ s acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ; and concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again . the principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that mr. wickham had resolved on quitting the militia .
austen	pride	mrs. bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments . “ i am sure , ” she added , “ if it was not for such good friends , i do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest temper i ever met with . i often tell my other girls they are nothing to _her_ . you have a sweet room here , mr. bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk . i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield . you will not think of quitting it in a hurry , i hope , though you have but a short lease . ”
austen	pride	“ but you -- how are you ? ” cried elizabeth . “ you look pale . how much you must have gone through ! ” her sister , however , assured her of her being perfectly well ; and their conversation , which had been passing while mr. and mrs. gardiner were engaged with their children , was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party . jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears .
austen	pride	“ how good it was in you , my dear mr. bennet ! but i knew i should persuade you at last . i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance . well , how pleased i am ! and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now . ”
austen	pride	“ covering a screen ” 45
austen	pride	“ the elevation of his feelings ” 267
austen	pride	“ well , lizzy , ” said mrs. bennet , one day , “ what is your opinion _now_ of this sad business of jane ’ s ? for my part , i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody . i told my sister philips so the other day . but i can not find out that jane saw anything of him in london . well , he is a very undeserving young man -- and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now . there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer ; and i have inquired of everybody , too , who is likely to know . ”
austen	pride	she could not think of darcy ’ s leaving kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and , agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him .
austen	pride	“ of music ! then pray speak aloud . it is of all subjects my delight . i must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music . there are few people in england , i suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste . if i had ever learnt , i should have been a great proficient . and so would anne , if her health had allowed her to apply . i am confident that she would have performed delightfully . how does georgiana get on , darcy ? ”
austen	pride	“ i hope you are well , miss bennet . that lady , i suppose , is your mother ? ” elizabeth replied very concisely that she was . “ and _that_ , i suppose , is one of your sisters ? ”
austen	pride	miss bennet ’ s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings . she was sorry that mr. darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister ’ s refusal must have given him .
austen	pride	“ but you see that jane , ” said her aunt , “ does not think so ill of wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt. ” “ of whom does jane ever think ill ? and who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ? but jane knows , as well as i do , what wickham really is . we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word ; that he has neither integrity nor honour ; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating . ”
austen	pride	jane shook her head . “ indeed , jane , you ought to believe me . no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection ; miss bingley , i am sure , can not : she is not such a simpleton . could she have seen half as much love in mr. darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes . but the case is this : -- we are not rich enough or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been _one_ inter-marriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way . but , my dearest jane , you can not seriously imagine that , because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday ; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that , instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . ”
austen	pride	after sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view , mr. collins attending them to point out its beauties , and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer .
austen	pride	“ certainly not , at first ; but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them . miss bingley is to live with her brother , and keep his house ; and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her . ”
austen	pride	in a few days mr. bingley returned mr. bennet ’ s visit , and sat about ten minutes with him in his library . he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ; but he saw only the father . the ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of ascertaining , from an upper window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse .
austen	pride	“ she is so fond of mrs. forster , ” said she , “ it will be quite shocking to send her away ! and there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much . the officers may not be so pleasant in general -- -- ’ s regiment . ”
austen	pride	to mr. darcy it was welcome intelligence : elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough . she attracted him more than he liked ; and miss bingley was uncivil to _her_ and more teasing than usual to himself . he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _now_ escape him -- nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity ; sensible that , if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it . steady to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday : and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour , he adhered most conscientiously to his book , and would not even look at her .
austen	pride	“ it is unlucky , ” said she , after a short pause , “ that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country . but may we not hope that the period of future happiness , to which miss bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ? mr. bingley will not be detained in london by them . ”
austen	pride	“ and have you answered the letter ? ” said elizabeth . “ no ; but it must be done soon. ” most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he wrote .
austen	pride	the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family . mrs. bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr. bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card . jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr. wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of everything in mr. darcy ’ s look and behaviour . the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended less on any single event , or any particular person ; for though they each , like elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with mr. wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was , at any rate , a ball . and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it .
austen	pride	mrs. gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ; and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself . his apparent partiality had subsided , his attentions were over , he was the admirer of some one else . elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain . her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it . the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable ; but elizabeth , less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than in charlotte ’ s , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence . nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and , while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy .
austen	pride	“ in my opinion , the younger son of an earl can know very little of either . now , seriously , what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence ? when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for ? ”
austen	pride	five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs. bennet and the children . but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents . this was one point , with regard to lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and mr. bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him . in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him . he had never before supposed that , could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement . he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser , by the hundred that was to be paid them ; for , what with her board and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother ’ s hands , lydia ’ s expenses had been very little within that sum .
austen	pride	“ if they had uncles enough to fill _all_ cheapside , ” cried bingley , “ it would not make them one jot less agreeable. ” “ but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , ” replied darcy .
austen	pride	elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father ’ s behaviour as a husband . she had always seen it with pain ; but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible . but she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents -- talents which , rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife .
austen	pride	“ there is , i believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome. ” “ and _your_ defect is a propensity to hate everybody . ”
austen	pride	“ from the former . i had narrowly observed her , during the two visits which i had lately made her here ; and i was convinced of her affection. ” “ and your assurance of it , i suppose , carried immediate conviction to him . ”
austen	pride	“ a great many indeed , ” said her companion , with a sigh . “ we have dined nine times at rosings , besides drinking tea there twice ! how much i shall have to tell ! ” elizabeth privately added , “ and how much i shall have to conceal ! ”
austen	pride	mrs. bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes ’ conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ; with tears and lamentations of regret , invectives against the villainous conduct of wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage ; blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing .
austen	pride	elizabeth tried to join in her father ’ s pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile . never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her .
austen	pride	the possibility of mr. collins ’ s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two : but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself ; and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out , --
austen	pride	“ i can not give you credit for any philosophy of the kind . _your_ retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy , but , what is much better , of ignorance . but with _me_ , it is not so . painful recollections will intrude , which can not , which ought not to be repelled . i have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle . as a child i was taught what was _right_ , but i was not taught to correct my temper . i was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit . unfortunately an only son ( for many years an only _child_ ) , i was spoiled by my parents , who , though good themselves , ( my father particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable , ) allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to _wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own . such i was , from eight to eight-and-twenty ; and such i might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest elizabeth ! what do i not owe you ! you taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous . by you , i was properly humbled . i came to you without a doubt of my reception . you showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased . ”
austen	pride	they came . the family were assembled in the breakfast-room to receive them . smiles decked the face of mrs. bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door ; her husband looked impenetrably grave ; her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy .
austen	pride	when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose , the tables were broken up , the carriage was offered to mrs. collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered . the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow . from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach ; and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr. collins ’ s side , and as many bows on sir william ’ s , they departed . as soon as they had driven from the door , elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings , which , for charlotte ’ s sake , she made more favourable than it really was . but her commendation , though costing her some trouble , could by no means satisfy mr. collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship ’ s praise into his own hands .
austen	pride	“ i can answer your question , ” said fitzwilliam , “ without applying to him . it is because he will not give himself the trouble. ” “ i certainly have not the talent which some people possess , ” said darcy , “ of conversing easily with those i have never seen before . i can not catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as i often see done . ”
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ accompanied by their aunt ” [ _copyright 1894 by george allen._ ] ] “ what can be the meaning of this ? ” said charlotte , as soon as he was gone . “ my dear eliza , he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way . ”
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ walked back with them ” [ _copyright 1894 by george allen._ ] ] soon after their return , a letter was delivered to miss bennet ; it came from netherfield , and was opened immediately . the envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot-pressed paper , well covered with a lady ’ s fair , flowing hand ; and elizabeth saw her sister ’ s countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages . jane recollected herself soon ; and putting the letter away , tried to join , with her usual cheerfulness , in the general conversation : but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from jane invited her to follow her upstairs . when they had gained their own room , jane , taking out her letter , said , “ this is from caroline bingley : what it contains has surprised me a good deal . the whole party have left netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again . you shall hear what she says . ”
austen	pride	after playing some italian songs , miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air ; and soon afterwards mr. darcy , drawing near elizabeth , said to her , -- “ do you not feel a great inclination , miss bennet , to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel ? ”
austen	pride	“ yours , etc. ” this letter gave elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned , as she considered that jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least . all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over . she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions . his character sunk on every review of it ; and , as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr. darcy ’ s sister , as , by wickham ’ s account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away .
austen	pride	“ there _is_ something a little stately in him , to be sure , ” replied her aunt ; “ but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming . i can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , _i_ have seen nothing of it . ”
austen	pride	they now walked on in silence ; each of them deep in thought . elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased . his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind . they soon outstripped the others ; and when they had reached the carriage , mr. and mrs. gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind .
austen	pride	when they were all in the drawing-room , the questions which elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give . the sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet deserted her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from lydia or her father , to explain their proceedings , and , perhaps , announce the marriage .
austen	pride	she replied in the affirmative . “ i almost envy you the pleasure , and yet i believe it would be too much for me , or else i could take it in my way to newcastle . and you saw the old housekeeper , i suppose ? poor reynolds , she was always very fond of me . but of course she did not mention my name to you . ”
austen	pride	“ oh , yes ! of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt . poor jane ! i am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately . it had better have happened to _you_ , lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner . but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ? change of scene might be of service -- and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything . ”
austen	pride	“ but now it comes out ” 442
austen	pride	“ remember , eliza , that he does not know jane ’ s disposition as you do. ” “ but if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavor to conceal it , he must find it out . ”
austen	pride	mrs. hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when mr. hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward . as all conversation was thereby at an end , elizabeth soon afterwards left the room .
austen	pride	heading to chapter xxi . 146
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ meeting accidentally in town ” [ _copyright 1894 by george allen._ ] ] himself . as to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of inquiring . his countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue . she tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of mr. darcy ; or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class what mr. darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years ’ continuance . but no such recollection befriended her . she could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address , but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess . after pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read . but , alas ! the story which followed , of his designs on miss darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself -- from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin ’ s affairs and whose character she had no reason to question . at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr. darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin ’ s corroboration .
austen	pride	the surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it . she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her .
austen	pride	miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face , and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections . mr. darcy replied , with great intrepidity , --
austen	pride	“ oh , shocking ! ” cried miss bingley . “ i never heard anything so abominable . how shall we punish him for such a speech ? ” “ nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , ” said elizabeth . “ we can all plague and punish one another . tease him -- laugh at him . intimate as you are , you must know how it is to be done . ”
austen	pride	after many pauses and many trials of other subjects , elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first , and saying , -- “ i am astonished at his intimacy with mr. bingley . how can mr. bingley , who seems good-humour itself , and is , i really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ? how can they suit each other ? do you know mr. bingley ? ”
austen	pride	“ i dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age. ” “ did you go by the village of kympton ? ” “ i do not recollect that we did. ” “ i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had . a most delightful place ! excellent parsonage-house ! it would have suited me in every respect . ”
austen	pride	“ thank you , sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me . we must not all expect jane ’ s good fortune. ” “ true , ” said mr. bennet ; “ but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may befall you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it . ”
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ the entreaties of several ” [ _copyright 1894 by george allen._ ] ] on his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , --
austen	pride	“ i might as well inquire , ” replied she , “ why , with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ? was not this some excuse for incivility , if i _was_ uncivil ? but i have other provocations . you know i have . had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? ”
austen	pride	but the gloom of lydia ’ s prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she received an invitation from mrs. forster , the wife of the colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to brighton . this invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married . a resemblance in good-humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other , and out of their _three_ months ’ acquaintance they had been intimate _two_ .
austen	pride	having now a good house and a very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to choose one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report . this was his plan of amends -- of atonement -- for inheriting their father ’ s estate ; and he thought it an excellent one , full of eligibility and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part .
austen	pride	“ yes , ” thought elizabeth ; “ _that_ would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once . good heaven ! brighton and a whole campful of soldiers , to us , who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia , and the monthly balls of meryton ! ”
austen	pride	when to these recollections was added the development of wickham ’ s character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful .
austen	pride	miss bennet still looked all amazement . elizabeth again , and more seriously , assured her of its truth . “ good heaven ! can it be really so ? yet now i must believe you , ” cried jane . “ my dear , dear lizzy , i would , i do congratulate you ; but are you certain -- forgive the question -- are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? ”
austen	pride	elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied .
austen	pride	lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ; and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence .
austen	pride	mr. collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane ; but , as he took up his abode with the lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs. bennet . his marriage was now fast approaching ; and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say , in an ill-natured tone , that she “ _wished_ they might be happy. ” thursday was to be the wedding-day , and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit ; and when she rose to take leave , elizabeth , ashamed of her mother ’ s ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room . as they went down stairs together , charlotte said , --
austen	pride	the invitation was accepted , of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine ’ s drawing-room . her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to darcy , much more than to any other person in the room .
austen	pride	“ no , my dear ; i think not . i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse . there is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter which promises well . i am impatient to see him . ”
austen	pride	bingley she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed . he was received by mrs. bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her courtesy and address of his friend .
austen	pride	“ mrs . long and her nieces ” 420
austen	pride	“ how should you have liked making sermons ? ” “ exceedingly well . i should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing . one ought not to repine ; but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me ! the quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas of happiness ! but it was not to be . did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance when you were in kent ? ”
austen	pride	“ yes , all of them , i think . they all paint tables , cover screens , and net purses . i scarcely know any one who can not do all this ; and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished . ”
austen	pride	“ the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger. ” mrs. bennet ’ s eyes sparkled . “ a gentleman and a stranger ! it is mr. bingley , i am sure . why , jane -- you never dropped a word of this -- you sly thing ! well , i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr. bingley . but -- good lord ! how unlucky ! there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day . lydia , my love , ring the bell . i must speak to hill this moment . ”
austen	pride	as the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park . every park has its beauty and its prospects ; and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as mr. collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh .
austen	pride	“ no , ” replied jane , “ i have not forgotten him ; but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you . mr. bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr. darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour , of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that mr. wickham has deserved much less attention from mr. darcy than he has received ; and i am sorry to say that by his account , as well as his sister ’ s , mr. wickham is by no means a respectable young man . i am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose mr. darcy ’ s regard . ”
austen	pride	“ he rode a black horse ” 10
austen	pride	as for wickham and lydia , their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters . he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and , in spite of everything , was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune . the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished . the letter was to this effect : --
austen	pride	persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected . he was resolutely silent , however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , --
austen	pride	“ with an affectionate smile ” 385
austen	pride	mr. darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt ’ s ill-breeding , and made no answer . when coffee was over , colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him ; and she sat down directly to the instrument . he drew a chair near her . lady catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer ’ s countenance . elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile , and said , --
austen	pride	mrs. bennet treasured up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before , was now high in her good graces .
austen	pride	elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham ; and , therefore , gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor wickham ’ s so amiable , as they had been considered in hertfordshire . in confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming her authority , but stating it to be such as might be relied on .
austen	pride	“ oh , yes ! you will only think i feel _more_ than i ought to do when i tell you all. ” “ what do you mean ? ” “ why , i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley . i am afraid you will be angry . ”
austen	pride	with respect to wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well-known fact that , on his quitting derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which mr. darcy afterwards discharged .
austen	pride	elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend . he bore it with noble indifference ; and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr. darcy , with an expression of half-laughing alarm .
austen	pride	but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news which then began to be in circulation . the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks . mrs. bennet was quite in the fidgets . she looked at jane , and smiled , and shook her head , by turns .
austen	pride	“ ay , because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield , and he could not help answering her ; but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to. ” “ miss bingley told me , ” said jane , “ that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance . with _them_ he is remarkably agreeable . ”
austen	pride	“ no , i thank you , ” she replied , endeavouring to recover herself . “ there is nothing the matter with me . i am quite well , i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn . ”
austen	pride	everybody was surprised ; and darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away . mrs. bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him , continued her triumph , --
austen	pride	“ upon my word , sir , ” cried elizabeth , “ your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration . i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies ( if such young ladies there are ) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time . i am perfectly serious in my refusal . you could not make _me_ happy , and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make _you_ so . nay , were your friend lady catherine to know me , i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation . ”
austen	pride	“ i am grieved , indeed , ” cried darcy : “ grieved -- shocked . but is it certain , absolutely certain ? ” “ oh , yes ! they left brighton together on sunday night , and were traced almost to london , but not beyond : they are certainly not gone to scotland . ”
austen	pride	with proper civilities , the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return . mrs. bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him . she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others : there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her ; and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that , if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers , he might become a very agreeable companion . but on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away . miss lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before .
austen	pride	[ illustration ] chapter xxv . [ illustration ] after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , mr. collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday . the pain of separation , however , might be alleviated on his side by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men . he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks .
austen	pride	darcy made no answer . he seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation ; his brow contracted , his air gloomy . elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it . her power was sinking ; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace . she could neither wonder nor condemn ; but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom , afforded no palliation of her distress . it was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain .
austen	pride	not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , --
austen	pride	“ nor i , i am sure , ” said miss bingley . “ then , ” observed elizabeth , “ you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman. ” “ yes ; i do comprehend a great deal in it . ”
austen	pride	“ perfectly so , i thank you. ” she found that she was to receive no other answer ; and , after a short pause , added , -- “ i think i have understood that mr. bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again ? ”
austen	pride	“ but depend upon it , mr. collins , ” she added , “ that lizzy shall be brought to reason . i will speak to her about it myself directly . she is a very headstrong , foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but i will _make_ her know it . ”
austen	pride	by tea-time , however , the dose had been enough , and mr. bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again , and when tea was over , glad to invite him
austen	pride	“ be not alarmed , madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so disgusting to you . i write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , can not be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read . you must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention ; your feelings , i know , will bestow it unwillingly , but i demand it of your justice .
austen	pride	after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good-humour , and cheerfulness began to reappear at longbourn . everything wore a happier aspect . the families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose . mrs. bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity ; and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears , -- an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope , that by the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless , by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office , another regiment should be quartered in meryton .
austen	pride	it was not without an effort , meanwhile , that she could wait even for longbourn , before she told her sister of mr. darcy ’ s proposals . to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered , but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate , and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of bingley , which might only grieve her sister further .
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ after a short survey ” [ _copyright 1894 by george allen._ ] ] “ how could i ever think her like her nephew ? ” said she , as she looked in her face . as soon as they entered the copse , lady catherine began in the following manner : --
austen	pride	that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate .
austen	pride	“ i begin to be sorry that he comes at all , ” said jane to her sister . “ it would be nothing ; i could see him with perfect indifference ; but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of . my mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know , how much i suffer from what she says . happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is over ! ”
austen	pride	elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more . mrs. reynolds could interest her on no other point . she related the subjects of the pictures , the dimensions of the rooms , and the price of the furniture in vain . mr. gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits , as they proceeded together up the great staircase .
austen	pride	colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly , with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man , and talked very pleasantly ; but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs. collins , sat for some time without speaking to anybody . at length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of elizabeth after the health of her family . she answered him in the usual way ; and , after a moment ’ s pause , added , --
austen	pride	“ and men take care that they should. ” “ if it is designedly done , they can not be justified ; but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine . ”
austen	pride	the gardiners stayed only one night at longbourn , and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement . one enjoyment was certain -- that of suitableness as companions ; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences -- cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure -- and affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad .

austen	pride	“ he is as fine a fellow , ” said mr. bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , “ as ever i saw . he simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all . i am prodigiously proud of him . i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law . ”
austen	pride	to mr. and mrs. gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself . they had long wished to see him . the whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention . the suspicions which had just arisen of mr. darcy and their niece , directed their observation towards each with an earnest , though guarded , inquiry ; and they soon drew from those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love . of the lady ’ s sensations they remained a little in doubt ; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough .
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ to whom i have related the affair ” [ _copyright 1894 by george allen._ ] ] daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence ; though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and mrs. bennet , i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age . howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied ; in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs. collins , but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter , to whom i have related the affair . they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others : for who , as lady catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family ? and this consideration leads me , moreover , to reflect , with augmented satisfaction , on a certain event of last november ; for had it been otherwise , i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace . let me advise you , then , my dear sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence .
austen	pride	“ it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it. ” “ you have a house in town , i conclude ? ” mr. darcy bowed . “ i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself , for i am fond of superior society ; but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas . ”
austen	pride	mr. collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth -- and it was soon done -- done while mrs. bennet was stirring the fire . elizabeth , equally next to jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course .
austen	pride	she explained what its effects on her had been , and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed . “ i knew , ” said he , “ that what i wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary . i hope you have destroyed the letter . there was one part , especially the opening of it , which i should dread your having the power of reading again . i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . ”
austen	pride	they found mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature ; and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to . catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort . much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday ; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle ; a private had been flogged ; and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married .
austen	pride	to complete the favourable impression , she then told him what mr. darcy had voluntarily done for lydia . he heard her with astonishment . “ this is an evening of wonders , indeed ! and so , darcy did everything ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow ’ s debts , and got him his commission ! so much the better . it will save me a world of trouble and economy . had it been your uncle ’ s doing , i must and _would_ have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry everything their own way . i shall offer to pay him to-morrow , he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . ”
austen	pride	while they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner . such formidable accounts of her ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened maria lucas , who had been little used to company ; and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at st. james ’ s .
austen	pride	“ you did ! and it was not wholly without foundation . you may remember what i told you on that point , when first we talked of it. ” they were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ; and unwilling , for her sister ’ s sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good-humoured smile , --
austen	pride	“ yours , etc. ” “ well , my dear , ” said mr. bennet , when elizabeth had read the note aloud , “ if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness -- if she should die -- it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr. bingley , and under your orders . ”
austen	pride	“ shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her ? ” “ i am more likely to want time than courage , elizabeth . but it ought to be done ; and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly . ”
austen	pride	hope was over , entirely over ; and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort . miss darcy ’ s praise occupied the chief of it . her many attractions were again dwelt on ; and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter . she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother ’ s being an inmate of mr. darcy ’ s house , and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture .
austen	pride	“ she has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker . i shall never forget her appearance this morning . she really looked almost wild. ” “ she did indeed , louisa . i could hardly keep my countenance . very nonsensical to come at all ! why must _she_ be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ? her hair so untidy , so blowzy ! ”
austen	pride	“ tenderly flirting ” 290
austen	pride	elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them . “ but what , ” said she , after a pause , “ can have been his motive ? what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ? ”
austen	pride	“ lizzy , ” said her father , “ i have given him my consent . he is the kind of man , indeed , to whom i should never dare refuse anything , which he condescended to ask . i now give it to _you_ , if you are resolved on having him . but let me advise you to think better of it . i know your disposition , lizzy . i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband , unless you looked up to him as a superior . your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage . you could scarcely escape discredit and misery . my child , let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to respect your partner in life . you know not what you are about . ”
austen	pride	“ oh , my dear mr. bennet , ” as she entered the room , “ we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball . i wish you had been there . jane was so admired , nothing could be like it . everybody said how well she looked ; and mr. bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice . only think of _that_ , my dear : he actually danced with her twice ; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time . first of all , he asked miss lucas . i was so vexed to see him stand up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all ; indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance . so he inquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next . then , the two third he danced with miss king , and the two fourth with maria lucas , and the two fifth with jane again , and the two sixth with lizzy , and the _boulanger_ -- -- ”

austen	pride	“ take care , lizzy ; that speech savours strongly of disappointment. ” before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer .
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ m^ { rs } . long and her nieces. ” ] mrs. bennet , in short , was in very great spirits : she had seen enough of bingley ’ s behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last ; and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals .
austen	pride	“ i admire the activity of your benevolence , ” observed mary , “ but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required . ”
austen	pride	but elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , -- “ no , no ; stay where you are . you are charmingly grouped , and appear to uncommon advantage . the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth . good-bye . ”
austen	pride	“ oh no -- it is not for _me_ to be driven away by mr. darcy . if _he_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_ he must go . we are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but i have no reason for avoiding _him_ but what i might proclaim to all the world -- a sense of very great ill-usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is . his father , miss bennet , the late mr. darcy , was one of the best men that ever breathed , and the truest friend i ever had ; and i can never be in company with this mr. darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections . his behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but i verily believe i could forgive him anything and everything , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father . ”
austen	pride	in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother ’ s words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr. darcy , who sat opposite to them . her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical .
austen	pride	“ i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party. ” “ true ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room . well , colonel fitzwilliam , what do i play next ? my fingers wait your orders . ”

austen	pride	in as short a time as mr. collins ’ s long speeches would allow , everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be waived for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness . the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and miss lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained .
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ the first pleasing earnest of their welcome ” ] chapter xlvii . [ illustration ] “ i have been thinking it over again , elizabeth , ” said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; “ and really , upon serious consideration , i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter . it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonel ’ s family , that i am strongly inclined to hope the best . could he expect that her friends would not step forward ? could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to colonel forster ? his temptation is not adequate to the risk . ”
austen	pride	jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail . they had often attempted it before : but it was a subject on which mrs. bennet was beyond the reach of reason ; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about .
austen	pride	“ i have heard much of your master ’ s fine person , ” said mrs. gardiner , looking at the picture ; “ it is a handsome face . but , lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not . ”
austen	pride	“ to jane herself , ” she exclaimed , “ there could be no possibility of objection , -- all loveliness and goodness as she is ! her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating . neither could anything be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which mr. darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach. ” when she thought of her mother , indeed , her confidence gave way a little ; but she would not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with mr. darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend ’ s connections than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided , at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining mr. bingley for his sister .

[ illustration ] it was the second week in may , in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch street for the town of -- -- , in hertfordshire ; and , as they drew near the appointed inn where mr. bennet ’ s carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman ’ s punctuality , both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining-room upstairs . these two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner , watching the sentinel on guard , and dressing a salad and cucumber .
austen	pride	“ and we mean to treat you all , ” added lydia ; “ but you must lend us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there. ” then showing her purchases , -- “ look here , i have bought this bonnet . i do not think it is very pretty ; but i thought i might as well buy it as not . i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home , and see if i can make it up any better . ”
austen	pride	“ dear lizzy ! ” “ oh , you are a great deal too apt , you know , to like people in general . you never see a fault in anybody . all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes . i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life . ”
austen	pride	“ at the door ” 194
austen	pride	lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs. bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though mrs. bennet ’ s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away .
austen	pride	“ we were born in the same parish , within the same park ; the greatest part of our youth was passed together : inmates of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same parental care . _my_ father began life in the profession which your uncle , mr. philips , appears to do so much credit to ; but he gave up everything to be of use to the late mr. darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property . he was most highly esteemed by mr. darcy , a most intimate , confidential friend . mr. darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father ’ s active superintendence ; and when , immediately before my father ’ s death , mr. darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ as of affection to myself . ”
austen	pride	darcy , after inquiring of her how mr. and mrs. gardiner did -- a question which she could not answer without confusion -- said scarcely anything . he was not seated by her : perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; but it had not been so in derbyshire . there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself . but now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at jane as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground . more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please , than when they last met , were plainly expressed . she was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so .

austen	pride	“ my reasons for marrying are , first , that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish ; secondly , that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and , thirdly , which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness . twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too ! ) on this subject ; and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford , -- between our pools at quadrille , while mrs. jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh ’ s footstool , -- that she said , ‘ mr . collins , you must marry . a clergyman like you must marry . choose properly , choose a gentlewoman for _my_ sake , and for your _own_ ; let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way . this is my advice . find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to hunsford , and i will visit her. ’ allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer . you will find her manners beyond anything i can describe ; and your wit and vivacity , i think , must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite . thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where i assure you there are many amiable young women . but the fact is , that being , as i am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father ( who , however , may live many years longer ) , i could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place -- which , however , as i have already said , may not be for several years . this has been my motive , my fair cousin , and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem . and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection . to fortune i am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since i am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents. , which will not be yours till after your mother ’ s decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to . on that head , therefore , i shall be uniformly silent : and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married . ”
austen	pride	[ illustration ] chapter xxx . [ illustration ] sir william stayed only a week at hunsford ; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter ’ s being most comfortably settled , and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with . while sir william was with them , mr. collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig , and showing him the country : but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration ; for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road . the room in which the ladies sat was backwards . elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use ; it was a better sized room , and had a pleasanter aspect : but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for mr. collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement .
austen	pride	“ nay , if you are so serious about it , i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled . you will have a charming mother-in-law , indeed , and of course she will be always at pemberley with you . ”
austen	pride	“ your affectionate friend , “ lydia bennet. ” “ oh , thoughtless , thoughtless lydia ! ” cried elizabeth when she had finished it . “ what a letter is this , to be written at such a moment ! but at least it shows that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey . whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a _scheme_ of infamy . my poor father ! how he must have felt it ! ”
austen	pride	mrs. bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages , and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four months . of having another daughter married to mr. collins she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure . elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _her_ , the worth of each was eclipsed by mr. bingley and netherfield .
austen	pride	she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged ; jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day . her hopes were answered ; jane had not been gone long before it rained hard . her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted . the rain continued the whole evening without intermission ; jane certainly could not come back .
austen	pride	“ _you_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , ” said mr. darcy , looking at the eldest miss bennet . “ oh , she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld ! but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and i dare say very agreeable . do let me ask my partner to introduce you . ”
austen	pride	“ it is evident by this , ” added jane , “ that he comes back no more this winter. ” “ it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he _should_. ” “ why will you think so ? it must be his own doing ; he is his own master . but you do not know _all_ . i _will_ read you the passage which particularly hurts me . i will have no reserves from _you_ . ‘ mr . darcy is impatient to see his sister ; and to confess the truth , _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again . i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister . i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but i will not leave the country without confiding them , and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable . my brother admires her greatly already ; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing ; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own ; and a sister ’ s partiality is not misleading me , i think , when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman ’ s heart . with all these circumstances to favour an attachment , and nothing to prevent it , am i wrong , my dearest jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? ’ what think you of _this_ sentence , my dear lizzy ? ” said jane , as she finished it . “ is it not clear enough ? does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother ’ s indifference ; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means ( most kindly ! ) to put me on my guard . can there be any other opinion on the subject ? ”
austen	pride	elizabeth almost stared at her . “ can this be mr. darcy ? ” thought she . “ his father was an excellent man , ” said mrs. gardiner . “ yes , ma ’ am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him -- just as affable to the poor . ”
austen	pride	“ we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , ” said jane : “ i hope and trust they will yet be happy . his consenting to marry her is a proof , i will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking . their mutual affection will steady them ; and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten . ”
austen	pride	mr. wickham ’ s attention was caught ; and after observing mr. collins for a few moments , he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh .
austen	pride	“ i should take him , even on _my_ slight acquaintance , to be an ill-tempered man. ” wickham only shook his head . “ i wonder , ” said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , “ whether he is likely to be in this country much longer . ”
austen	pride	in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away . easter was approaching , and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at rosings , which in so small a circle must be important . elizabeth had heard , soon after her arrival , that mr. darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks ; and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley ’ s designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine , who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself .
austen	pride	here she was interrupted again . mr. bennet protested against any description of finery . she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit , and some exaggeration , the shocking rudeness of mr. darcy .
austen	pride	“ in point of composition , ” said mary , “ his letter does not seem defective . the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet i think it is well expressed . ”
austen	pride	sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity . mr. collins ’ s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair . lady lucas began directly to calculate , with more interest than the matter had ever
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ the spiteful old ladies ” [ _copyright 1894 by george allen._ ] ] chapter l. [ illustration ] mr. bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an annual sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she survived him . he now wished it more than ever . had he done his duty in that respect , lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her . the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place .
austen	pride	elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately . miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility : mr. darcy looked up . he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book . he was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would interfere . what could he mean ? she was dying to know what could be his meaning -- and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him .
austen	pride	she perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself in their first evening at mr. philips ’ s . many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory . she was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before . she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct . she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr. darcy -- that mr. darcy might leave the country , but that _he_ should stand his ground ; yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week . she remembered , also , that till the netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal , it had been everywhere discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking mr. darcy ’ s character , though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son .
austen	pride	“ you allude , perhaps , to the entail of this estate. ” “ ah , sir , i do indeed . it is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess . not that i mean to find fault with _you_ , for such things , i know , are all chance in this world . there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed . ”

austen	pride	“ what does mr. darcy mean , ” said she to charlotte , “ by listening to my conversation with colonel forster ? ” “ that is a question which mr. darcy only can answer. ” “ but if he does it any more , i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about . he has a very satirical eye , and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself , i shall soon grow afraid of him . ”
austen	pride	“ my real purpose was to see _you_ , and to judge , if i could , whether i might ever hope to make you love me . my avowed one , or what i avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister was still partial to bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which i have since made . ”
austen	pride	“ would you believe it , lizzy , that when he went to town last november he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again ? ”
austen	pride	“ when colonel miller ’ s regiment went away ” 285
austen	pride	no one but mrs. bennet regretted that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home . these parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think than such as did not .
austen	pride	“ my style of writing is very different from yours. ” “ oh , ” cried miss bingley , “ charles writes in the most careless way imaginable . he leaves out half his words , and blots the rest . ”
austen	pride	“ are they , indeed ? ” cried elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction . “ they are going to be encamped near brighton ; and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer ! it would be such a delicious scheme , and i dare say would hardly cost anything at all . mamma would like to go , too , of all things ! only think what a miserable summer else we shall have ! ”
austen	pride	elizabeth excused herself as well as she could : said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning .
austen	pride	in the afternoon , the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ; and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy . after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event , which elizabeth considered as all but certain , and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible , the former continued the subject by saying , “ but tell me all and everything about it which i have not already heard . give me further particulars . what did colonel forster say ? had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place ? they must have seen them together for ever . ”
austen	pride	“ well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual : i thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them . if you ’ ll believe me , i did not once put my foot out of doors , though i was there a fortnight . not one party , or scheme , or anything ! to be sure , london was rather thin , but , however , the little theatre was open .
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ he never failed to inform them ” ] the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week ; and , allowing for the loss of sir william , and there being only one card-table in the evening , every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first . their other engagements were few , as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the collinses ’ reach . this , however , was no evil to elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough : there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors . her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine ’ s curiosity .
austen	pride	“ i will go to meryton , ” said she , “ as soon as i am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister philips . and as i come back , i can call on lady lucas and mrs. long . kitty , run down and order the carriage . an airing would do me a great deal of good , i am sure . girls , can i do anything for you in meryton ? oh ! here comes hill . my dear hill , have you heard the good news ? miss lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding . ”
austen	pride	“ she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind . why does she not come in ? ” “ oh , charlotte says she hardly ever does . it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in . ”
austen	pride	_in respect of her art generally , mr. goldwin smith has truly observed that “ metaphor has been exhausted in depicting the perfection of it , combined with the narrowness of her field ; ” and he has justly added that we need not go beyond her own comparison to the art of a miniature painter . to make this latter observation quite exact we must not use the term miniature in its restricted sense , and must think rather of memling at one end of the history of painting and meissonier at the other , than of cosway or any of his kind . and i am not so certain that i should myself use the word “ narrow ” in connection with her . if her world is a microcosm , the cosmic quality of it is at least as eminent as the littleness . she does not touch what she did not feel herself called to paint ; i am not so sure that she could not have painted what she did not feel herself called to touch . it is at least remarkable that in two very short periods of writing -- one of about three years , and another of not much more than five -- she executed six capital works , and has not left a single failure . it is possible that the romantic paste in her composition was defective : we must always remember that hardly anybody born in her decade -- that of the eighteenth-century seventies -- independently exhibited the full romantic quality . even scott required hill and mountain and ballad , even coleridge metaphysics and german to enable them to chip the classical shell . miss austen was an english girl , brought up in a country retirement , at the time when ladies went back into the house if there was a white frost which might pierce their kid shoes , when a sudden cold was the subject of the gravest fears , when their studies , their ways , their conduct were subject to all those fantastic limits and restrictions against which mary wollstonecraft protested with better general sense than particular taste or judgment . miss austen , too , drew back when the white frost touched her shoes ; but i think she would have made a pretty good journey even in a black one._
austen	pride	“ believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and , depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire . as for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin elizabeth . ”
austen	pride	to such perseverance in wilful self-deception elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , that if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female .
austen	pride	“ you certainly do , ” she replied with a smile ; “ but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome. ” “ i should be sorry , indeed , if it were . _we_ were always good friends , and now we are better . ”
austen	pride	“ he came down to see the place ” 2
austen	pride	he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ; and before he went away an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and mrs. bennet ’ s means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband .
austen	pride	“ i want to know , ” said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister ’ s , “ what you have learnt about mr. wickham . but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person , in which case you may be sure of my pardon . ”
austen	pride	“ i suspected as much , ” replied elizabeth . “ but how did he account for it ? ” “ it must have been his sisters ’ doing . they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which i can not wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects . but when they see , as i trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again : though we can never be what we once were to each other . ”
austen	pride	“ i must ask whether you were surprised ? ” said elizabeth . “ not at all . when i went away , i felt that it would soon happen. ” “ that is to say , you had given your permission . i guessed as much. ” and though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case .
austen	pride	“ ay , no doubt : but that is what a governess will prevent ; and if i had known your mother , i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one . i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it . it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way . i am always glad to get a young person well placed out . four nieces of mrs. jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day that i recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her . mrs. collins , did i tell you of lady metcalfe ’ s calling yesterday to thank me ? she finds miss pope a treasure . ‘ lady catherine , ’ said she , ‘ you have given me a treasure. ’ are any of your younger sisters out , miss bennet ? ”
austen	pride	“ did mr. darcy give you his reasons for this interference ? ” “ i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady. ” “ and what arts did he use to separate them ? ”
austen	pride	mr. gardiner left them soon after breakfast . the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon .
austen	pride	“ may i hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth , when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? ”
austen	pride	mr. collins ’ s return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs. bennet . on the contrary , she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband . it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome . she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable . such were the gentle murmurs of mrs. bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr. bingley ’ s continued absence .
austen	pride	[ illustration ] chapter xiv [ illustration ] during dinner , mr. bennet scarcely spoke at all ; but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness . lady catherine de bourgh ’ s attention to his wishes , and consideration for his comfort , appeared very remarkable . mr. bennet could not have chosen better . mr. collins was eloquent in her praise . the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner ; and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank -- such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from lady catherine . she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her . she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings , and had sent for him only the saturday before , to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening . lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people , he knew , but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her . she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations . she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage , where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making , and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself , -- some shelves in the closets upstairs .
austen	pride	“ this is not to be borne . miss bennet , i insist on being satisfied . has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? ” “ your ladyship has declared it to be impossible . ”
austen	pride	after this day , jane said no more of her indifference . not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley ; but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless mr. darcy returned within the stated time . seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman ’ s concurrence .
austen	pride	with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr. wickham and the officers , mr. collins seemed to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs. philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin .
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ the efforts of his aunt ” [ _copyright 1894 by george allen._ ] ] chapter lviii . [ illustration ] instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as elizabeth half expected mr. bingley to do , he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine ’ s visit . the gentlemen arrived early ; and , before mrs. bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , bingley , who wanted to be alone with jane , proposed their all walking out . it was agreed to . mrs. bennet was not in the habit of walking , mary could never spare time , but the remaining five set off together . bingley and jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them . they lagged behind , while elizabeth , kitty , and darcy were to entertain each other . very little was said by either ; kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and , perhaps , he might be doing the same .
austen	pride	“ was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane , while she was ill at netherfield ? ” “ dearest jane ! who could have done less for her ? but make a virtue of it by all means . my good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and i shall begin directly , by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last ? what made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ? why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? ”
austen	pride	she would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out , as she entered the library , -- “ oh , mr. bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an uproar . you must come and make lizzy marry mr. collins , for she vows she will not have him ; and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_ . ”
austen	pride	“ blame you ! oh , no. ” “ but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham ? ” “ no -- i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did. ” “ but you _will_ know it , when i have told you what happened the very next day . ”
austen	pride	their reception at home was most kind . mrs. bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty ; and more than once during dinner did mr. bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth , -- -- “ i am glad you are come back , lizzy . ”
austen	pride	“ i can not pretend to be sorry , ” said wickham , after a short interruption , “ that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts ; but with _him_ i believe it does not often happen . the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chooses to be seen . ”
austen	pride	the effect was immediate . a deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his features , but he said not a word ; and elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on . at length darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said , --
austen	pride	the post 359
austen	pride	“ thank you , ” said lydia ; “ for if you did , i should certainly tell you all , and then wickham would be so angry. ” on such encouragement to ask , elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away .
austen	pride	“ miss elizabeth bennet. ” “ miss elizabeth bennet ! ” repeated miss bingley . “ i am all astonishment . how long has she been such a favourite ? and pray when am i to wish you joy ? ”
austen	pride	“ they had forgotten to leave any message ” 270
austen	pride	“ whatever i do is done in a hurry , ” replied he ; “ and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield , i should probably be off in five minutes . at present , however , i consider myself as quite fixed here . ”
austen	pride	elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply . mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them .
austen	pride	mr. bingley followed his advice . mr. darcy walked off ; and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him . she told the story , however , with great spirit among her friends ; for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in anything ridiculous .
austen	pride	“ that is the most unforgiving speech , ” said elizabeth , “ that i ever heard you utter . good girl ! it would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of miss bingley ’ s pretended regard . ”
austen	pride	another entreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment . when convinced on that article , miss bennet had nothing further to wish .
austen	pride	mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how . “ while mary is adjusting her ideas , ” he continued , “ let us return to mr. bingley. ” “ i am sick of mr. bingley , ” cried his wife .
austen	pride	“ perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her . but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together . jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention . when she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses . ”
austen	pride	mr. darcy ’ s letter to lady catherine was in a different style , and still different from either was what mr. bennet sent to mr. collins , in return for his last . / * “ dear sir , * /
austen	pride	elizabeth soon perceived , that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active magistrate in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr. collins ; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented , or too poor , she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold them into harmony and plenty .
austen	pride	“ it has been coming on so gradually , that i hardly know when it began ; but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley . ”
austen	pride	“ yes , my youngest is not sixteen . perhaps _she_ is full young to be much in company . but really , ma ’ am , i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement , because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early . the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first . and to be kept back on _such_ a motive ! i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind . ”
austen	pride	they walked towards the lucases ’ , because kitty wished to call upon maria ; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone . now was the moment for her resolution to be executed ; and while her courage was high , she immediately said , --
austen	pride	“ sir , you quite misunderstand me , ” said mrs. bennet , alarmed . “ lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these . in everything else she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived . i will go directly to mr. bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , i am sure . ”
austen	pride	“ i did not know before that you ever walked this way. ” “ i have been making the tour of the park , ” he replied , “ as i generally do every year , and intended to close it with a call at the parsonage . are you going much farther ? ”
austen	pride	“ it shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , ” said bingley . “ i am afraid , mr. darcy , ” observed miss bingley , in a half whisper , “ that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes . ”
austen	pride	lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ; but mr. collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said , -- “ i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp , though written solely for their benefit . it amazes me , i confess ; for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction . but i will no longer importune my young cousin . ”
austen	pride	“ that is very true , ” said elizabeth ; “ though it had not occurred to me before . his debts to be discharged , and something still to remain ! oh , it must be my uncle ’ s doings ! generous , good man , i am afraid he has distressed himself . a small sum could not do all this . ”
austen	pride	“ indeed ! ” cried wickham , with a look which did not escape her . “ and pray may i ask -- ” but checking himself , he added , in a gayer tone , “ is it in address that he improves ? has he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style ? for i dare not hope , ” he continued , in a lower and more serious tone , “ that he is improved in essentials . ”
austen	pride	mr. bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do . he delighted in going to pemberley , especially when he was least expected .
austen	pride	“ and this , ” cried darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , “ is your opinion of me ! this is the estimation in which you hold me ! i thank you for explaining it so fully . my faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed ! but , perhaps , ” added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , “ these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design . these bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had i , with greater policy , concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by everything . but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence . nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related . they were natural and just . could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ? -- to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? ”
austen	pride	“ lizzy , my dear , i want to speak to you ” 422
austen	pride	“ i am thinking of what you have been telling me , ” said she . “ your cousin ’ s conduct does not suit my feelings . why was he to be the judge ? ” “ you are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? ”
austen	pride	“ he made a little mistake , to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty. ” this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities .
austen	pride	but elizabeth had now recollected herself ; and , making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her , with tolerable firmness , that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness .
austen	pride	heading to chapter xliv . 318
austen	pride	“ certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger . i know we dine with four-and-twenty families . ”
austen	pride	but when elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to charlotte ’ s wishes , to be the case ; and , after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do , which was the more probable from the time of year . all field sports were over . within doors there was lady catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen can not be always within doors ; and in the nearness of the parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day . they called at various times of the morning , sometimes separately , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt . it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration , of her former favourite , george wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam ’ s manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind .
austen	pride	his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a tenant , miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table ; nor was mrs. hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her . mr. bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted , by an accidental recommendation , to look at netherfield house . he did look at it , and into it , for half an hour ; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately .
austen	pride	when the gentlemen rose to go away , mrs. bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days ’ time .
austen	pride	“ it was the prospect of constant society , and good society , ” he added , “ which was my chief inducement to enter the -- -- shire . i know it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps ; and my friend denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them . society , i own , is necessary to me . i have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude . i _must_ have employment and society . a military life is not what i was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible . the church _ought_ to have been my profession -- i was brought up for the church ; and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now . ”
austen	pride	“ i do , i do like him , ” she replied , with tears in her eyes ; “ i love him . indeed he has no improper pride . he is perfectly amiable . you do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . ”
austen	pride	“ yes , very handsome. ” “ i am sure _i_ know none so handsome ; but in the gallery upstairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this . this room was my late master ’ s favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then . he was very fond of them . ”
austen	pride	“ yours sincerely , ” etc . miss bingley ’ s congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere . she wrote even to jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard . jane was not deceived , but she was affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved .
austen	pride	“ certainly not. ” “ to walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone ! what could she mean by it ? it seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country-town indifference to decorum . ”
austen	pride	“ now , kitty , you may cough as much as you choose , ” said mr. bennet ; and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife . “ what an excellent father you have , girls , ” said she , when the door was shut . “ i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me either , for that matter . at our time of life , it is not so pleasant , i can tell you , to be making new acquaintances every day ; but for your sakes we would do anything . lydia , my love , though you _are_ the youngest , i dare say mr. bingley will dance with you at the next ball . ”
austen	pride	“ neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , ” replied elizabeth , “ has any possible claim on me , in the present instance . no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with mr. darcy . and with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former _were_ excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment ’ s concern -- and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn . ”
austen	pride	though elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine , have answered this question , she could not but say , after a moment ’ s deliberation , -- “ i am not. ” lady catherine seemed pleased .
austen	pride	the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written ; and when it closed , elizabeth , in the solitude of her chamber , had to meditate upon charlotte ’ s degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and composure in bearing with , her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well . she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass , the quiet tenour of their usual employments , the vexatious interruptions of mr. collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings . a lively imagination soon settled it all .
austen	pride	in her kind schemes for elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam . he was , beyond comparison , the pleasantest man : he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to counterbalance these advantages , mr. darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all .
austen	pride	they travelled as expeditiously as possible ; and sleeping one night on the road , reached longbourn by dinnertime the next day . it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations .
austen	pride	“ no , really , ” replied elizabeth ; “ i think there can not be too little said on the subject. ” “ la ! you are so strange ! but i must tell you how it went off . we were married , you know , at st. clement ’ s , because wickham ’ s lodgings were in that parish . and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o ’ clock . my uncle and aunt and i were to go together ; and the others were to meet us at the church .
austen	pride	the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of mr. darcy ’ s civility , and , above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister .
austen	pride	with the mention of derbyshire , there were many ideas connected . it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner . “ but surely , ” said she , “ i may enter his county with impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars , without his perceiving me . ”
austen	pride	on sunday , after morning service , the separation , so agreeable to almost all , took place . miss bingley ’ s civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for jane ; and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former . elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits .
austen	pride	“ you are severe on us. ” “ it will be _her_ turn soon to be teased , ” said miss lucas . “ i am going to open the instrument , eliza , and you know what follows . ”
austen	pride	the rest of the evening brought her little amusement . she was teased by mr. collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side ; and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others . in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the room . he assured her that , as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was , by delicate attentions , to recommend himself to her ; and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening . there was no arguing upon such a project . she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas , who often joined them , and good-naturedly engaged mr. collins ’ s conversation to herself .
austen	pride	“ complied with ! i am only ashamed of his asking so little. ” “ and they _must_ marry ! yet he is _such_ a man. ” “ yes , yes , they must marry . there is nothing else to be done . but there are two things that i want very much to know : -- one is , how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about ; and the other , how i am ever to pay him . ”
austen	pride	she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance . anxious and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing-room before the gentlemen came , was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil . she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend .
austen	pride	“ miss eliza bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room . i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude . ”
austen	pride	how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate ! it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him , with some confusion , of her attachment to mr. darcy .
austen	pride	“ i thank you for my share of the favour , ” said elizabeth ; “ but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands. ” their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them . mr. wickham had received his commission before he left london , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight .
austen	pride	“ when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject , i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and , perhaps , you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . ”
austen	pride	“ ’ tis too much ! ” she added , “ by far too much . i do not deserve it . oh , why is not everybody as happy ? ” elizabeth ’ s congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express . every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane . but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said , for the present .
austen	pride	“ what is his name ? ” “ bingley. ” “ is he married or single ? ” “ oh , single , my dear , to be sure ! a single man of large fortune ; four or five thousand a year . what a fine thing for our girls ! ”
austen	pride	“ you may readily comprehend , ” she added , “ what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and , comparatively speaking , a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time . pray write instantly , and let me understand it -- unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary ; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . ”
austen	pride	“ were it certain that lady catherine would think so , ” said mr. collins , very gravely -- “ but i can not imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you . and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications . ”
austen	pride	“ my dear sir , ” replied mr. collins , “ i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship ’ s concurrence . ”
austen	pride	“ oh , yes ! be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy . say that urgent business calls us home immediately . conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible . i know it can not be long . ”
austen	pride	words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings ; and he was obliged to walk about the room , while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences .
austen	pride	“ i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us . it was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention . his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling . ”
austen	pride	“ oh , my dear lydia , ” she cried , “ when shall we meet again ? ” “ oh , lord ! i don ’ t know . not these two or three years , perhaps. ” “ write to me very often , my dear . ”
austen	pride	“ without once opening his lips ” 24
austen	pride	she burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could not speak another word . darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something indistinctly of his
austen	pride	“ you can _now_ have nothing further to say , ” she resentfully answered . “ you have insulted me , in every possible method . i must beg to return to the house. ” and she rose as she spoke . lady catherine rose also , and they turned back . her ladyship was highly incensed .
austen	pride	“ if you were aware , ” said elizabeth , “ of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of lydia ’ s unguarded and imprudent manner , nay , which has already arisen from it , i am sure you would judge differently in the affair . ”
austen	pride	mr. and mrs. gardiner smiled . elizabeth could not help saying , “ it is very much to his credit , i am sure , that you should think so. ” “ i say no more than the truth , and what everybody will say that knows him , ” replied the other . elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , “ i have never had a cross word from him in my life , and i have known him ever since he was four years old . ”
austen	pride	“ my dear mr. bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother . when they get to our age , i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do . i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well -- and , indeed , so i do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , i shall not say nay to him ; and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william ’ s in his regimentals . ”
austen	pride	“ i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here. ” this part of his intelligence , though unheard by lydia , was caught by elizabeth ; and , as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham ’ s absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make . attention , forbearance , patience with darcy , was injury to wickham . she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr. bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her .
austen	pride	“ it ought to be good , ” he replied : “ it has been the work of many generations. ” “ and then you have added so much to it yourself -- you are always buying books. ” “ i can not comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these . ”
austen	pride	“ your list of the common extent of accomplishments , ” said darcy , “ has too much truth . the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen ; but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general . i can not boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished . ”
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ delighted to see their dear friend again ” ] chapter xvii . [ illustration ] elizabeth related to jane , the next day , what had passed between mr. wickham and herself . jane listened with astonishment and concern : she knew not how to believe that mr. darcy could be so unworthy of mr. bingley ’ s regard ; and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham . the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing therefore remained to be done but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained .
austen	pride	“ my dear , dear lydia ! ” she cried : “ this is delightful indeed ! she will be married ! i shall see her again ! she will be married at sixteen ! my good , kind brother ! i knew how it would be -- i knew he would manage everything . how i long to see her ! and to see dear wickham too ! but the clothes , the wedding clothes ! i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly . lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her . stay , stay , i will go myself . ring the bell , kitty , for hill . i will put on my things in a moment . my dear , dear lydia ! how merry we shall be together when we meet ! ”
austen	pride	mrs. gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces . she shared in their attendance on mrs. bennet , and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom . their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and heartening them up -- though , as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham ’ s extravagance or irregularity , she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them .
austen	pride	“ i am perfectly convinced by it that mr. darcy has no defect . he owns it himself without disguise. ” “ no , ” said darcy , “ i have made no such pretension . i have faults enough , but they are not , i hope , of understanding . my temper i dare not vouch for . it is , i believe , too little yielding ; certainly too little for the convenience of the world . i can not forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought , nor their offences against myself . my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them . my temper would perhaps be called resentful . my good opinion once lost is lost for ever . ”
austen	pride	what a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now have been gladly and gratefully received ! he was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex . but while he was mortal , there must be a triumph .
austen	pride	“ i am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins , and could say much on the subject , but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate . but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them . at present i will not say more , but , perhaps , when we are better acquainted -- -- ”
austen	pride	but of this answer lydia heard not a word . she seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute , and never attended to mary at all . in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton , and see how everybody went on ; but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme . it should not be said , that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers . there was another reason , too , for her opposition . she dreaded seeing wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible . the comfort to _her_ , of the regiment ’ s approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression . in a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account .
austen	pride	she then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card-party , and was sitting upstairs with kitty . elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation .
austen	pride	she was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee-cup himself ; and she seized the opportunity of saying , -- “ is your sister at pemberley still ? ” “ yes ; she will remain there till christmas . ”
austen	pride	heading to chapter xl . 278
austen	pride	between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject ; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again . her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return .
austen	pride	“ and i certainly _never_ shall give it . i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable . your ladyship wants mr. darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make _their_ marriage at all more probable ? supposing him to be attached to me , would _my_ refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ? allow me to say , lady catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged . you have widely mistaken my character , if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these . how far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs , i can not tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine . i must beg , therefore , to be importuned no further on the subject . ”
austen	pride	elizabeth made no objection : the door was then allowed to be shut , and the carriage drove off . “ good gracious ! ” cried maria , after a few minutes ’ silence , “ it seems but a day or two since we first came ! and yet how many things have happened ! ”
austen	pride	“ ah , jane , i take your place now , and you must go lower , because i am a married woman. ” it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first . her ease and good spirits increased . she longed to see mrs. philips , the lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called “ mrs . wickham ” by each of them ; and in the meantime she went after dinner to show her ring and boast of being married to mrs. hill and the two housemaids .
austen	pride	“ i have found out , ” said he , “ by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation to my patroness . i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh , and of her mother , lady catherine . how wonderfully these sort of things occur ! who would have thought of my meeting with -- perhaps -- a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly ! i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which i am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before . my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . ”
austen	pride	“ and what am i to do on the occasion ? it seems a hopeless business. ” “ speak to lizzy about it yourself . tell her that you insist upon her marrying him. ” “ let her be called down . she shall hear my opinion . ”
austen	pride	of mr. darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ; and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find . they could not be untouched by his politeness ; and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant ’ s report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for mr. darcy . there was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant , who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners indicated respectability , was not to be hastily rejected . neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight . they had nothing to accuse him of but pride ; pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town where the family did not visit . it was acknowledged , however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor .
austen	pride	“ i can not see that london has any great advantage over the country , for my part , except the shops and public places . the country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , mr. bingley ? ”
austen	pride	elizabeth hesitated ; but her knees trembled under her , and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them . calling back the servant , therefore , she commissioned him , though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible , to fetch his master and mistress home instantly .
austen	pride	elizabeth looked archly , and turned away . her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by miss bingley , --
austen	pride	lydia ’ s intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten : every sister except mary agreed to go with her ; and mr. collins was to attend them , at the request of mr. bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ; for thither mr. collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection , but really talking to mr. bennet , with little cessation , of his house and garden at hunsford . such doings discomposed mr. bennet exceedingly . in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there : his civility , therefore , was most prompt in inviting mr. collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and mr. collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go .
austen	pride	it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr. darcy himself ; but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day . when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ; when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible . never , even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield , or his dignified relations at rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve , as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings .
austen	pride	“ if i had been able , ” said she , “ to carry my point in going to brighton with all my family , _this_ would not have happened : but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her . why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight ? i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after . i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but i was over-ruled , as i always am . poor , dear child ! and now here ’ s mr. bennet gone away , and i know he will fight wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ? the collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , i do not know what we shall do . ”
austen	pride	the period of expectation was now doubled . four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt ’ s arrival . but they did pass away , and mr. and mrs. gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at longbourn . the children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way -- teaching them , playing with them , and loving them .
austen	pride	elizabeth asked questions in vain ; maria would tell her nothing more ; and down they ran into the dining-room which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder ; it was two ladies , stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate .
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ in conversation with the ladies ” [ copyright 1894 by george allen . ] ] “ oh , my dear eliza ! pray make haste and come into the dining-room , for there is such a sight to be seen ! i will not tell you what it is . make haste , and come down this moment . ”
austen	pride	if he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him . in that case he would return no more . lady catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way .
austen	pride	[ illustration ] chapter xviii . [ illustration ] till elizabeth entered the drawing-room at netherfield , and looked in vain for mr. wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her . the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her . she had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening . but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted , for mr. darcy ’ s pleasure , in the bingleys ’ invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr. denny , to whom lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile , --
austen	pride	“ i do not see what right mr. darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend ’ s inclination ; or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy . but , ” she continued , recollecting herself , “ as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him . it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . ”
austen	pride	“ come here , my love , i want to speak to you , ” took her out of the room . jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation , and her entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it . in a few minutes , mrs. bennet half opened the door and called out , --
austen	pride	“ well , well , and so mr. bingley is coming down , sister , ” ( for mrs. philips first brought her the news ) . “ well , so much the better . not that i care about it , though . he is nothing to us , you know , and i am sure i never want to see him again . but , however , he is very welcome to come to netherfield , if he likes it . and who knows what _may_ happen ? but that is nothing to us . you know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it . and so , it is quite certain he is coming ? ”
austen	pride	the park was very large , and contained great variety of ground . they entered it in one of its lowest points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent .
austen	pride	she had never perceived , while the regiment was in hertfordshire , that lydia had any partiality for him ; but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody . sometimes one officer , sometimes another , had been her favourite , as their attentions raised them in her opinion . her affections had been continually fluctuating , but never without an object . the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl -- oh ! how acutely did she now feel it !
austen	pride	the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished -- that of mrs. bennet perhaps surpassing the rest ; though when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while .
austen	pride	“ where is your sister ? ” said he hastily , as he opened the door . “ with my mother upstairs . she will be down in a moment , i dare say. ” he then shut the door , and , coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister . elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship . they shook hands with great cordiality ; and then , till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness , and of jane ’ s perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded , because they had for basis the excellent understanding and super-excellent disposition of jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself .
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ i am sure she did not listen. ” ] chapter lii . [ illustration ] elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could . she was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial .
austen	pride	the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening . after tea , mr. bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and mary went upstairs to her instrument . two obstacles of the five being thus removed , mrs. bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them . elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last kitty did , she very innocently said , “ what is the matter , mamma ? what do you keep winking at me for ? what am i to do ? ”
austen	pride	elizabeth did not know what to make of it . had she not seen him in derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friend ’ s permission , or being bold enough to come without it .
austen	pride	“ hearing herself called ” 243
austen	pride	“ perhaps we might be deceived. ” “ that is not very likely ; our authority was too good. ” on reaching the spacious lobby above , they were shown into a very pretty sitting-room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below ; and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to miss darcy , who had taken a liking to the room , when last at pemberley .
austen	pride	the idea of mr. collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued , --
austen	pride	mr. bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth . so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to _his_ easy temper , or _her_ affectionate heart . the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified : he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire ; and jane and elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other .
austen	pride	“ but if i do not take your likeness now , i may never have another opportunity. ” “ i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , ” he coldly replied . she said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree ; for in darcy ’ s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another .
austen	pride	_still , all this does not explain her charm , which , taking beauty as a common form of all heroines , may perhaps consist in the addition to her playfulness , her wit , her affectionate and natural disposition , of a certain fearlessness very uncommon in heroines of her type and age . nearly all of them would have been in speechless awe of the magnificent darcy ; nearly all of them would have palpitated and fluttered at the idea of proposals , even naughty ones , from the fascinating wickham . elizabeth , with nothing offensive , nothing_ viraginous , _nothing of the “ new woman ” about her , has by nature what the best modern ( not “ new ” ) women have by education and experience , a perfect freedom from the idea that all men may bully her if they choose , and that most will away with her if they can . though not in the least “ impudent and mannish grown , ” she has no mere sensibility , no nasty niceness about her . the form of passion common and likely to seem natural in miss austen ’ s day was so invariably connected with the display of one or the other , or both of these qualities , that she has not made elizabeth outwardly passionate . but i , at least , have not the slightest doubt that she would have married darcy just as willingly without pemberley as with it , and anybody who can read between lines will not find the lovers ’ conversations in the final chapters so frigid as they might have looked to the della cruscans of their own day , and perhaps do look to the della cruscans of this._
austen	pride	“ the gentlemen accompanied him ” 213
austen	pride	as for elizabeth , her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last ; and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion ; and she lay awake two whole hours , endeavouring to make them out . she certainly did not hate him . no ; hatred had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called . the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced . but above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good-will which could not be overlooked . it was gratitude ; -- gratitude , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection . he who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance ; and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister . such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitude -- for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed ; and , as such , its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined . she respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses .
austen	pride	she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance . “ i hope , ” said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , “ you will give your mother-in-law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can compass it , to cure the younger girls of running after the officers . and , if i may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady possesses . ”
austen	pride	“ oh , but the gentlemen will have mr. bingley ’ s chaise to go to meryton ; and the hursts have no horses to theirs. ” “ i had much rather go in the coach. ” “ but , my dear , your father can not spare the horses , i am sure . they are wanted in the farm , mr. bennet , are not they ? ”
austen	pride	on his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so miserably ill , that it was impossible for darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and commiseration , “ let me call your maid . is there nothing you could take to give you present relief ? a glass of wine ; shall i get you one ? you are very ill . ”
austen	pride	he answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped . to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said , --
austen	pride	“ my dear , you flatter me . i certainly _have_ had my share of beauty , but i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now . when a woman has five grown-up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty . ”
austen	sense	as mrs. jennings could talk on no other subject , elinor soon saw the necessity of preparing marianne for its discussion . no time was to be lost in undeceiving her , in making her acquainted with the real truth , and in endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others , without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister , or any resentment against edward .
austen	sense	elinor ’ s office was a painful one.—she was going to remove what she really believed to be her sister ’ s chief consolation , —to give such particulars of edward as she feared would ruin him for ever in her good opinion , -and to make marianne , by a resemblance in their situations , which to _her_ fancy would seem strong , feel all her own disappointment over again . but unwelcome as such a task must be , it was necessary to be done , and elinor therefore hastened to perform it .
austen	sense	she was very far from wishing to dwell on her own feelings , or to represent herself as suffering much , any otherwise than as the self-command she had practised since her first knowledge of edward ’ s engagement , might suggest a hint of what was practicable to marianne . her narration was clear and simple ; and though it could not be given without emotion , it was not accompanied by violent agitation , nor impetuous grief . _that_ belonged rather to the hearer , for marianne listened with horror , and cried excessively . elinor was to be the comforter of others in her own distresses , no less than in theirs ; and all the comfort that could be given by assurances of her own composure of mind , and a very earnest vindication of edward from every charge but of imprudence , was readily offered .
austen	sense	but marianne for some time would give credit to neither . edward seemed a second willoughby ; and acknowledging as elinor did , that she _had_ loved him most sincerely , could she feel less than herself ! as for lucy steele , she considered her so totally unamiable , so absolutely incapable of attaching a sensible man , that she could not be persuaded at first to believe , and afterwards to pardon , any former affection of edward for her . she would not even admit it to have been natural ; and elinor left her to be convinced that it was so , by that which only could convince her , a better knowledge of mankind .
austen	sense	her first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact of the engagement , and the length of time it had existed.—marianne ’ s feelings had then broken in , and put an end to all regularity of detail ; and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her distress , lessen her alarms , and combat her resentment . the first question on her side , which led to farther particulars , was , —
austen	sense	“ how long has this been known to you , elinor ? has he written to you ? ” “ i have known it these four months . when lucy first came to barton park last november , she told me in confidence of her engagement . ”
austen	sense	at these words , marianne ’ s eyes expressed the astonishment which her lips could not utter . after a pause of wonder , she exclaimed— “ four months ! —have you known of this four months ? ” elinor confirmed it .
austen	sense	“ what ! while attending me in all my misery , has this been on your heart ? and i have reproached you for being happy ! ” “ it was not fit that you should then know how much i was the reverse ! ”
austen	sense	“ four months ! ” cried marianne again . “ so calm ! so cheerful ! how have you been supported ? ” “ by feeling that i was doing my duty.—my promise to lucy , obliged me to be secret . i owed it to her , therefore , to avoid giving any hint of the truth ; and i owed it to my family and friends , not to create in them a solicitude about me , which it could not be in my power to satisfy . ”
austen	sense	marianne seemed much struck . “ i have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother , ” added elinor ; “ and once or twice i have attempted it ; —but without betraying my trust , i never could have convinced you . ”
austen	sense	“ four months ! and yet you loved him ! ” “ yes . but i did not love only him ; and while the comfort of others was dear to me , i was glad to spare them from knowing how much i felt . now , i can think and speak of it with little emotion . i would not have you suffer on my account ; for i assure you i no longer suffer materially myself . i have many things to support me . i am not conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own , i have borne it as much as possible without spreading it farther . i acquit edward of essential misconduct . i wish him very happy ; and i am so sure of his always doing his duty , that though now he may harbour some regret , in the end he must become so . lucy does not want sense , and that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built . and after all , marianne , after all that is bewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment , and all that can be said of one ’ s happiness depending entirely on any particular person , it is not meant—it is not fit—it is not possible that it should be so . edward will marry lucy ; he will marry a woman superior in person and understanding to half her sex ; and time and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought another superior to _her_ . ”
austen	sense	“ if such is your way of thinking , ” said marianne , “ if the loss of what is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else , your resolution , your self-command , are , perhaps , a little less to be wondered at.—they are brought more within my comprehension . ”
austen	sense	“ i understand you . you do not suppose that i have ever felt much . for four months , marianne , i have had all this hanging on my mind , without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature ; knowing that it would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you , yet unable to prepare you for it in the least . it was told me , —it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself , whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects ; and told me , as i thought , with triumph . this person ’ s suspicions , therefore , i have had to oppose , by endeavouring to appear indifferent where i have been most deeply interested ; and it has not been only once ; i have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again . i have known myself to be divided from edward for ever , without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the connection . nothing has proved him unworthy ; nor has anything declared him indifferent to me . i have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister , and the insolence of his mother ; and have suffered the punishment of an attachment , without enjoying its advantages . and all this has been going on at a time , when , as you know too well , it has not been my only unhappiness . if you can think me capable of ever feeling , surely you may suppose that i have suffered _now_ . the composure of mind with which i have brought myself at present to consider the matter , the consolation that i have been willing to admit , have been the effect of constant and painful exertion ; they did not spring up of themselves ; they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first . no , marianne . _then_ , if i had not been bound to silence , perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely—not even what i owed to my dearest friends—from openly showing that i was _very_ unhappy . ”
austen	sense	marianne was quite subdued . “ oh ! elinor , ” she cried , “ you have made me hate myself for ever.—how barbarous have i been to you ! —you , who have been my only comfort , who have borne with me in all my misery , who have seemed to be only suffering for me ! —is this my gratitude ? —is this the only return i can make you ? —because your merit cries out upon myself , i have been trying to do it away . ”
austen	sense	the tenderest caresses followed this confession . in such a frame of mind as she was now in , elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her whatever promise she required ; and at her request , marianne engaged never to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of bitterness ; to meet lucy without betraying the smallest increase of dislike to her ; and even to see edward himself , if chance should bring them together , without any diminution of her usual cordiality . these were great concessions ; but where marianne felt that she had injured , no reparation could be too much for her to make .
austen	sense	she performed her promise of being discreet , to admiration.—she attended to all that mrs. jennings had to say upon the subject , with an unchanging complexion , dissented from her in nothing , and was heard three times to say , “ yes , ma ’ am. ” —she listened to her praise of lucy with only moving from one chair to another , and when mrs. jennings talked of edward ’ s affection , it cost her only a spasm in her throat.—such advances towards heroism in her sister , made elinor feel equal to any thing herself .
austen	sense	the next morning brought a farther trial of it , in a visit from their brother , who came with a most serious aspect to talk over the dreadful affair , and bring them news of his wife .
austen	sense	“ you have heard , i suppose , ” said he with great solemnity , as soon as he was seated , “ of the very shocking discovery that took place under our roof yesterday. ” they all looked their assent ; it seemed too awful a moment for speech .
austen	sense	“ your sister , ” he continued , “ has suffered dreadfully . mrs. ferrars too—in short it has been a scene of such complicated distress—but i will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us quite overcome . poor fanny ! she was in hysterics all yesterday . but i would not alarm you too much . donavan says there is nothing materially to be apprehended ; her constitution is a good one , and her resolution equal to any thing . she has borne it all , with the fortitude of an angel ! she says she never shall think well of anybody again ; and one can not wonder at it , after being so deceived ! —meeting with such ingratitude , where so much kindness had been shown , so much confidence had been placed ! it was quite out of the benevolence of her heart , that she had asked these young women to her house ; merely because she thought they deserved some attention , were harmless , well-behaved girls , and would be pleasant companions ; for otherwise we both wished very much to have invited you and marianne to be with us , while your kind friend there , was attending her daughter . and now to be so rewarded ! ‘ i wish , with all my heart , ’ says poor fanny in her affectionate way , ‘ that we had asked your sisters instead of them . ’ ”
austen	sense	here he stopped to be thanked ; which being done , he went on . “ what poor mrs. ferrars suffered , when first fanny broke it to her , is not to be described . while she with the truest affection had been planning a most eligible connection for him , was it to be supposed that he could be all the time secretly engaged to another person ! —such a suspicion could never have entered her head ! if she suspected _any_ prepossession elsewhere , it could not be in _that_ quarter . ‘ _there_ , to be sure , ’ said she , ‘ i might have thought myself safe. ’ she was quite in an agony . we consulted together , however , as to what should be done , and at last she determined to send for edward . he came . but i am sorry to relate what ensued . all that mrs. ferrars could say to make him put an end to the engagement , assisted too as you may well suppose by my arguments , and fanny ’ s entreaties , was of no avail . duty , affection , every thing was disregarded . i never thought edward so stubborn , so unfeeling before . his mother explained to him her liberal designs , in case of his marrying miss morton ; told him she would settle on him the norfolk estate , which , clear of land-tax , brings in a good thousand a-year ; offered even , when matters grew desperate , to make it twelve hundred ; and in opposition to this , if he still persisted in this low connection , represented to him the certain penury that must attend the match . his own two thousand pounds she protested should be his all ; she would never see him again ; and so far would she be from affording him the smallest assistance , that if he were to enter into any profession with a view of better support , she would do all in her power to prevent him advancing in it . ”
austen	sense	here marianne , in an ecstasy of indignation , clapped her hands together , and cried , “ gracious god ! can this be possible ! ” “ well may you wonder , marianne , ” replied her brother , “ at the obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these . your exclamation is very natural . ”
austen	sense	marianne was going to retort , but she remembered her promises , and forbore . “ all this , however , ” he continued , “ was urged in vain . edward said very little ; but what he did say , was in the most determined manner . nothing should prevail on him to give up his engagement . he would stand to it , cost him what it might . ”
austen	sense	“ then , ” cried mrs. jennings with blunt sincerity , no longer able to be silent , “ he has acted like an honest man ! i beg your pardon , mr. dashwood , but if he had done otherwise , i should have thought him a rascal . i have some little concern in the business , as well as yourself , for lucy steele is my cousin , and i believe there is not a better kind of girl in the world , nor one who more deserves a good husband . ”
austen	sense	john dashwood was greatly astonished ; but his nature was calm , not open to provocation , and he never wished to offend anybody , especially anybody of good fortune . he therefore replied , without any resentment ,
austen	sense	“ i would by no means speak disrespectfully of any relation of yours , madam . miss lucy steele is , i dare say , a very deserving young woman , but in the present case you know , the connection must be impossible . and to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under her uncle ’ s care , the son of a woman especially of such very large fortune as mrs. ferrars , is perhaps , altogether a little extraordinary . in short , i do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person whom you have a regard for , mrs. jennings . we all wish her extremely happy ; and mrs. ferrars ’ s conduct throughout the whole , has been such as every conscientious , good mother , in like circumstances , would adopt . it has been dignified and liberal . edward has drawn his own lot , and i fear it will be a bad one . ”
austen	sense	marianne sighed out her similar apprehension ; and elinor ’ s heart wrung for the feelings of edward , while braving his mother ’ s threats , for a woman who could not reward him . “ well , sir , ” said mrs. jennings , “ and how did it end ? ”
austen	sense	“ i am sorry to say , ma ’ am , in a most unhappy rupture : —edward is dismissed for ever from his mother ’ s notice . he left her house yesterday , but where he is gone , or whether he is still in town , i do not know ; for _we_ of course can make no inquiry . ”
austen	sense	“ poor young man ! —and what is to become of him ? ” “ what , indeed , ma ’ am ! it is a melancholy consideration . born to the prospect of such affluence ! i can not conceive a situation more deplorable . the interest of two thousand pounds—how can a man live on it ? —and when to that is added the recollection , that he might , but for his own folly , within three months have been in the receipt of two thousand , five hundred a-year ( for miss morton has thirty thousand pounds , ) i can not picture to myself a more wretched condition . we must all feel for him ; and the more so , because it is totally out of our power to assist him . ”
austen	sense	“ poor young man ! ” cried mrs. jennings , “ i am sure he should be very welcome to bed and board at my house ; and so i would tell him if i could see him . it is not fit that he should be living about at his own charge now , at lodgings and taverns . ”
austen	sense	elinor ’ s heart thanked her for such kindness towards edward , though she could not forbear smiling at the form of it . “ if he would only have done as well by himself , ” said john dashwood , “ as all his friends were disposed to do by him , he might now have been in his proper situation , and would have wanted for nothing . but as it is , it must be out of anybody ’ s power to assist him . and there is one thing more preparing against him , which must be worse than all—his mother has determined , with a very natural kind of spirit , to settle _that_ estate upon robert immediately , which might have been edward ’ s , on proper conditions . i left her this morning with her lawyer , talking over the business . ”
austen	sense	“ well ! ” said mrs. jennings , “ that is _her_ revenge . everybody has a way of their own . but i don ’ t think mine would be , to make one son independent , because another had plagued me . ”
austen	sense	marianne got up and walked about the room . “ can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man , ” continued john , “ than to see his younger brother in possession of an estate which might have been his own ? poor edward ! i feel for him sincerely . ”
austen	sense	a few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion , concluded his visit ; and with repeated assurances to his sisters that he really believed there was no material danger in fanny ’ s indisposition , and that they need not therefore be very uneasy about it , he went away ; leaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments on the present occasion , as far at least as it regarded mrs. ferrars ’ s conduct , the dashwoods ’ , and edward ’ s .
austen	sense	marianne ’ s indignation burst forth as soon as he quitted the room ; and as her vehemence made reserve impossible in elinor , and unnecessary in mrs. jennings , they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the party .
austen	sense	chapter xxxviii . mrs. jennings was very warm in her praise of edward ’ s conduct , but only elinor and marianne understood its true merit . _they_ only knew how little he had had to tempt him to be disobedient , and how small was the consolation , beyond the consciousness of doing right , that could remain to him in the loss of friends and fortune . elinor gloried in his integrity ; and marianne forgave all his offences in compassion for his punishment . but though confidence between them was , by this public discovery , restored to its proper state , it was not a subject on which either of them were fond of dwelling when alone . elinor avoided it upon principle , as tending to fix still more upon her thoughts , by the too warm , too positive assurances of marianne , that belief of edward ’ s continued affection for herself which she rather wished to do away ; and marianne ’ s courage soon failed her , in trying to converse upon a topic which always left her more dissatisfied with herself than ever , by the comparison it necessarily produced between elinor ’ s conduct and her own .
austen	sense	she felt all the force of that comparison ; but not as her sister had hoped , to urge her to exertion now ; she felt it with all the pain of continual self-reproach , regretted most bitterly that she had never exerted herself before ; but it brought only the torture of penitence , without the hope of amendment . her mind was so much weakened that she still fancied present exertion impossible , and therefore it only dispirited her more .
austen	sense	nothing new was heard by them , for a day or two afterwards , of affairs in harley street , or bartlett ’ s buildings . but though so much of the matter was known to them already , that mrs. jennings might have had enough to do in spreading that knowledge farther , without seeking after more , she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort and inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could ; and nothing but the hindrance of more visitors than usual , had prevented her going to them within that time .
austen	sense	the third day succeeding their knowledge of the particulars , was so fine , so beautiful a sunday as to draw many to kensington gardens , though it was only the second week in march . mrs. jennings and elinor were of the number ; but marianne , who knew that the willoughbys were again in town , and had a constant dread of meeting them , chose rather to stay at home , than venture into so public a place .
austen	sense	an intimate acquaintance of mrs. jennings joined them soon after they entered the gardens , and elinor was not sorry that by her continuing with them , and engaging all mrs. jennings ’ s conversation , she was herself left to quiet reflection . she saw nothing of the willoughbys , nothing of edward , and for some time nothing of anybody who could by any chance whether grave or gay , be interesting to her . but at last she found herself with some surprise , accosted by miss steele , who , though looking rather shy , expressed great satisfaction in meeting them , and on receiving encouragement from the particular kindness of mrs. jennings , left her own party for a short time , to join their ’ s . mrs. jennings immediately whispered to elinor ,
austen	sense	“ get it all out of her , my dear . she will tell you any thing if you ask . you see i can not leave mrs. clarke. ” it was lucky , however , for mrs. jennings ’ s curiosity and elinor ’ s too , that she would tell any thing _without_ being asked ; for nothing would otherwise have been learnt .
austen	sense	“ i am so glad to meet you ; ” said miss steele , taking her familiarly by the arm— “ for i wanted to see you of all things in the world. ” and then lowering her voice , “ i suppose mrs. jennings has heard all about it . is she angry ? ”
austen	sense	“ not at all , i believe , with you. ” “ that is a good thing . and lady middleton , is _she_ angry ? ” “ i can not suppose it possible that she should be. ” “ i am monstrous glad of it . good gracious ! i have had such a time of it ! i never saw lucy in such a rage in my life . she vowed at first she would never trim me up a new bonnet , nor do any thing else for me again , so long as she lived ; but now she is quite come to , and we are as good friends as ever . look , she made me this bow to my hat , and put in the feather last night . there now , _you_ are going to laugh at me too . but why should not i wear pink ribbons ? i do not care if it _is_ the doctor ’ s favourite colour . i am sure , for my part , i should never have known he _did_ like it better than any other colour , if he had not happened to say so . my cousins have been so plaguing me ! i declare sometimes i do not know which way to look before them . ”
austen	sense	she had wandered away to a subject on which elinor had nothing to say , and therefore soon judged it expedient to find her way back again to the first . “ well , but miss dashwood , ” speaking triumphantly , “ people may say what they chuse about mr. ferrars ’ s declaring he would not have lucy , for it is no such thing i can tell you ; and it is quite a shame for such ill-natured reports to be spread abroad . whatever lucy might think about it herself , you know , it was no business of other people to set it down for certain . ”
austen	sense	“ i never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before , i assure you , ” said elinor . “ oh , did not you ? but it _was_ said , i know , very well , and by more than one ; for miss godby told miss sparks , that nobody in their senses could expect mr. ferrars to give up a woman like miss morton , with thirty thousand pounds to her fortune , for lucy steele that had nothing at all ; and i had it from miss sparks myself . and besides that , my cousin richard said himself , that when it came to the point he was afraid mr. ferrars would be off ; and when edward did not come near us for three days , i could not tell what to think myself ; and i believe in my heart lucy gave it up all for lost ; for we came away from your brother ’ s wednesday , and we saw nothing of him not all thursday , friday , and saturday , and did not know what was become of him . once lucy thought to write to him , but then her spirits rose against that . however this morning he came just as we came home from church ; and then it all came out , how he had been sent for wednesday to harley street , and been talked to by his mother and all of them , and how he had declared before them all that he loved nobody but lucy , and nobody but lucy would he have . and how he had been so worried by what passed , that as soon as he had went away from his mother ’ s house , he had got upon his horse , and rid into the country , some where or other ; and how he had stayed about at an inn all thursday and friday , on purpose to get the better of it . and after thinking it all over and over again , he said , it seemed to him as if , now he had no fortune , and no nothing at all , it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement , because it must be for her loss , for he had nothing but two thousand pounds , and no hope of any thing else ; and if he was to go into orders , as he had some thoughts , he could get nothing but a curacy , and how was they to live upon that ? —he could not bear to think of her doing no better , and so he begged , if she had the least mind for it , to put an end to the matter directly , and leave him shift for himself . i heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be . and it was entirely for _her_ sake , and upon _her_ account , that he said a word about being off , and not upon his own . i will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being tired of her , or of wishing to marry miss morton , or any thing like it . but , to be sure , lucy would not give ear to such kind of talking ; so she told him directly ( with a great deal about sweet and love , you know , and all that—oh , la ! one can ’ t repeat such kind of things you know ) —she told him directly , she had not the least mind in the world to be off , for she could live with him upon a trifle , and how little so ever he might have , she should be very glad to have it all , you know , or something of the kind . so then he was monstrous happy , and talked on some time about what they should do , and they agreed he should take orders directly , and they must wait to be married till he got a living . and just then i could not hear any more , for my cousin called from below to tell me mrs. richardson was come in her coach , and would take one of us to kensington gardens ; so i was forced to go into the room and interrupt them , to ask lucy if she would like to go , but she did not care to leave edward ; so i just run up stairs and put on a pair of silk stockings and came off with the richardsons . ”
austen	sense	“ i do not understand what you mean by interrupting them , ” said elinor ; “ you were all in the same room together , were not you ? ” “ no , indeed , not us . la ! miss dashwood , do you think people make love when any body else is by ? oh , for shame ! —to be sure you must know better than that . ( laughing affectedly . ) —no , no ; they were shut up in the drawing-room together , and all i heard was only by listening at the door . ”
austen	sense	“ how ! ” cried elinor ; “ have you been repeating to me what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door ? i am sorry i did not know it before ; for i certainly would not have suffered you to give me particulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known yourself . how could you behave so unfairly by your sister ? ”
austen	sense	“ oh , la ! there is nothing in _that_ . i only stood at the door , and heard what i could . and i am sure lucy would have done just the same by me ; for a year or two back , when martha sharpe and i had so many secrets together , she never made any bones of hiding in a closet , or behind a chimney-board , on purpose to hear what we said . ”
austen	sense	elinor tried to talk of something else ; but miss steele could not be kept beyond a couple of minutes , from what was uppermost in her mind . “ edward talks of going to oxford soon , ” said she ; “ but now he is lodging at no.— , pall mall . what an ill-natured woman his mother is , an ’ t she ? and your brother and sister were not very kind ! however , i shan ’ t say anything against them to _you ; _ and to be sure they did send us home in their own chariot , which was more than i looked for . and for my part , i was all in a fright for fear your sister should ask us for the huswifes she had gave us a day or two before ; but , however , nothing was said about them , and i took care to keep mine out of sight . edward have got some business at oxford , he says ; so he must go there for a time ; and after _that_ , as soon as he can light upon a bishop , he will be ordained . i wonder what curacy he will get ! good gracious ! ( giggling as she spoke ) i ’ d lay my life i know what my cousins will say , when they hear of it . they will tell me i should write to the doctor , to get edward the curacy of his new living . i know they will ; but i am sure i would not do such a thing for all the world . ‘ la ! ’ i shall say directly , ‘ i wonder how you could think of such a thing ? _i_ write to the doctor , indeed ! ’ ”
austen	sense	“ well , ” said elinor , “ it is a comfort to be prepared against the worst . you have got your answer ready. ” miss steele was going to reply on the same subject , but the approach of her own party made another more necessary .
austen	sense	“ oh , la ! here come the richardsons . i had a vast deal more to say to you , but i must not stay away from them not any longer . i assure you they are very genteel people . he makes a monstrous deal of money , and they keep their own coach . i have not time to speak to mrs. jennings about it myself , but pray tell her i am quite happy to hear she is not in anger against us , and lady middleton the same ; and if anything should happen to take you and your sister away , and mrs. jennings should want company , i am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her for as long a time as she likes . i suppose lady middleton won ’ t ask us any more this bout . good-by ; i am sorry miss marianne was not here . remember me kindly to her . la ! if you have not got your spotted muslin on ! —i wonder you was not afraid of its being torn . ”
austen	sense	such was her parting concern ; for after this , she had time only to pay her farewell compliments to mrs. jennings , before her company was claimed by mrs. richardson ; and elinor was left in possession of knowledge which might feed her powers of reflection some time , though she had learnt very little more than what had been already foreseen and foreplanned in her own mind . edward ’ s marriage with lucy was as firmly determined on , and the time of its taking place remained as absolutely uncertain , as she had concluded it would be ; —every thing depended , exactly after her expectation , on his getting that preferment , of which , at present , there seemed not the smallest chance .
austen	sense	as soon as they returned to the carriage , mrs. jennings was eager for information ; but as elinor wished to spread as little as possible intelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained , she confined herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars , as she felt assured that lucy , for the sake of her own consequence , would choose to have known . the continuance of their engagement , and the means that were able to be taken for promoting its end , was all her communication ; and this produced from mrs. jennings the following natural remark .
austen	sense	“ wait for his having a living ! —ay , we all know how _that_ will end : —they will wait a twelvemonth , and finding no good comes of it , will set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds a-year , with the interest of his two thousand pounds , and what little matter mr. steele and mr. pratt can give her . then they will have a child every year ! and lord help ’ em ! how poor they will be ! i must see what i can give them towards furnishing their house . two maids and two men , indeed ! as i talked of t ’ other day . no , no , they must get a stout girl of all works . betty ’ s sister would never do for them _now_ . ”
austen	sense	the next morning brought elinor a letter by the two-penny post from lucy herself . it was as follows : “ bartlett ’ s building , march . “ i hope my dear miss dashwood will excuse the liberty i take of writing to her ; but i know your friendship for me will make you pleased to hear such a good account of myself and my dear edward , after all the troubles we have went through lately , therefore will make no more apologies , but proceed to say that , thank god ! though we have suffered dreadfully , we are both quite well now , and as happy as we must always be in one another ’ s love . we have had great trials , and great persecutions , but however , at the same time , gratefully acknowledge many friends , yourself not the least among them , whose great kindness i shall always thankfully remember , as will edward too , who i have told of it . i am sure you will be glad to hear , as likewise dear mrs. jennings , i spent two happy hours with him yesterday afternoon , he would not hear of our parting , though earnestly did i , as i thought my duty required , urge him to it for prudence sake , and would have parted for ever on the spot , would he consent to it ; but he said it should never be , he did not regard his mother ’ s anger , while he could have my affections ; our prospects are not very bright , to be sure , but we must wait , and hope for the best ; he will be ordained shortly ; and should it ever be in your power to recommend him to any body that has a living to bestow , am very sure you will not forget us , and dear mrs. jennings too , trust she will speak a good word for us to sir john , or mr. palmer , or any friend that may be able to assist us.—poor anne was much to blame for what she did , but she did it for the best , so i say nothing ; hope mrs. jennings won ’ t think it too much trouble to give us a call , should she come this way any morning , ’ twould be a great kindness , and my cousins would be proud to know her.—my paper reminds me to conclude ; and begging to be most gratefully and respectfully remembered to her , and to sir john , and lady middleton , and the dear children , when you chance to see them , and love to miss marianne ,
austen	sense	“ i am , & c. ” as soon as elinor had finished it , she performed what she concluded to be its writer ’ s real design , by placing it in the hands of mrs. jennings , who read it aloud with many comments of satisfaction and praise .
austen	sense	“ very well indeed ! —how prettily she writes ! —aye , that was quite proper to let him be off if he would . that was just like lucy . poor soul ! i wish i _could_ get him a living , with all my heart . she calls me dear mrs. jennings , you see . she is a good-hearted girl as ever lived . very well upon my word . that sentence is very prettily turned . yes , yes , i will go and see her , sure enough . how attentive she is , to think of every body ! —thank you , my dear , for showing it me . it is as pretty a letter as ever i saw , and does lucy ’ s head and heart great credit . ”
austen	sense	chapter xxxix . the miss dashwoods had now been rather more than two months in town , and marianne ’ s impatience to be gone increased every day . she sighed for the air , the liberty , the quiet of the country ; and fancied that if any place could give her ease , barton must do it . elinor was hardly less anxious than herself for their removal , and only so much less bent on its being effected immediately , as that she was conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey , which marianne could not be brought to acknowledge . she began , however , seriously to turn her thoughts towards its accomplishment , and had already mentioned their wishes to their kind hostess , who resisted them with all the eloquence of her good-will , when a plan was suggested , which , though detaining them from home yet a few weeks longer , appeared to elinor altogether much more eligible than any other . the palmers were to remove to cleveland about the end of march , for the easter holidays ; and mrs. jennings , with both her friends , received a very warm invitation from charlotte to go with them . this would not , in itself , have been sufficient for the delicacy of miss dashwood ; —but it was inforced with so much real politeness by mr. palmer himself , as , joined to the very great amendment of his manners towards them since her sister had been known to be unhappy , induced her to accept it with pleasure .
austen	sense	when she told marianne what she had done , however , her first reply was not very auspicious . “ cleveland ! ” —she cried , with great agitation . “ no , i can not go to cleveland. ” “ you forget , ” said elinor gently , “ that its situation is not—that it is not in the neighbourhood of— ”
austen	sense	“ but it is in somersetshire.—i can not go into somersetshire.—there , where i looked forward to going ... no , elinor , you can not expect me to go there. ” elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such feelings ; —she only endeavoured to counteract them by working on others ; —represented it , therefore , as a measure which would fix the time of her returning to that dear mother , whom she so much wished to see , in a more eligible , more comfortable manner , than any other plan could do , and perhaps without any greater delay . from cleveland , which was within a few miles of bristol , the distance to barton was not beyond one day , though a long day ’ s journey ; and their mother ’ s servant might easily come there to attend them down ; and as there could be no occasion of their staying above a week at cleveland , they might now be at home in little more than three weeks ’ time . as marianne ’ s affection for her mother was sincere , it must triumph with little difficulty , over the imaginary evils she had started .
austen	sense	mrs. jennings was so far from being weary of her guests , that she pressed them very earnestly to return with her again from cleveland . elinor was grateful for the attention , but it could not alter her design ; and their mother ’ s concurrence being readily gained , every thing relative to their return was arranged as far as it could be ; —and marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the hours that were yet to divide her from barton .
austen	sense	“ ah ! colonel , i do not know what you and i shall do without the miss dashwoods ; ” —was mrs. jennings ’ s address to him when he first called on her , after their leaving her was settled— “ for they are quite resolved upon going home from the palmers ; —and how forlorn we shall be , when i come back ! —lord ! we shall sit and gape at one another as dull as two cats . ”
austen	sense	perhaps mrs. jennings was in hopes , by this vigorous sketch of their future ennui , to provoke him to make that offer , which might give himself an escape from it ; and if so , she had soon afterwards good reason to think her object gained ; for , on elinor ’ s moving to the window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print , which she was going to copy for her friend , he followed her to it with a look of particular meaning , and conversed with her there for several minutes . the effect of his discourse on the lady too , could not escape her observation , for though she was too honorable to listen , and had even changed her seat , on purpose that she might _not_ hear , to one close by the piano forte on which marianne was playing , she could not keep herself from seeing that elinor changed colour , attended with agitation , and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment . still farther in confirmation of her hopes , in the interval of marianne ’ s turning from one lesson to another , some words of the colonel ’ s inevitably reached her ear , in which he seemed to be apologising for the badness of his house . this set the matter beyond a doubt . she wondered , indeed , at his thinking it necessary to do so ; but supposed it to be the proper etiquette . what elinor said in reply she could not distinguish , but judged from the motion of her lips , that she did not think _that_ any material objection ; and mrs. jennings commended her in her heart for being so honest . they then talked on for a few minutes longer without her catching a syllable , when another lucky stop in marianne ’ s performance brought her these words in the colonel ’ s calm voice , —
austen	sense	“ i am afraid it can not take place very soon. ” astonished and shocked at so unlover-like a speech , she was almost ready to cry out , “ lord ! what should hinder it ? ” —but checking her desire , confined herself to this silent ejaculation .
austen	sense	“ this is very strange ! —sure he need not wait to be older. ” this delay on the colonel ’ s side , however , did not seem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least , for on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards , and moving different ways , mrs. jennings very plainly heard elinor say , and with a voice which showed her to feel what she said ,
austen	sense	“ i shall always think myself very much obliged to you. ” mrs. jennings was delighted with her gratitude , and only wondered that after hearing such a sentence , the colonel should be able to take leave of them , as he immediately did , with the utmost _sang-froid_ , and go away without making her any reply ! she had not thought her old friend could have made so indifferent a suitor .
austen	sense	what had really passed between them was to this effect . “ i have heard , ” said he , with great compassion , “ of the injustice your friend mr. ferrars has suffered from his family ; for if i understand the matter right , he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering in his engagement with a very deserving young woman . have i been rightly informed ? is it so ? ; ”
austen	sense	elinor told him that it was . “ the cruelty , the impolitic cruelty , ” he replied , with great feeling , “ of dividing , or attempting to divide , two young people long attached to each other , is terrible . mrs. ferrars does not know what she may be doing—what she may drive her son to . i have seen mr. ferrars two or three times in harley street , and am much pleased with him . he is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted in a short time , but i have seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake , and as a friend of yours , i wish it still more . i understand that he intends to take orders . will you be so good as to tell him that the living of delaford , now just vacant , as i am informed by this day ’ s post , is his , if he think it worth his acceptance ; but _that_ , perhaps , so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now , it may be nonsense to appear to doubt ; i only wish it were more valuable . it is a rectory , but a small one ; the late incumbent , i believe , did not make more than 200£ per annum , and though it is certainly capable of improvement , i fear , not to such an amount as to afford him a very comfortable income . such as it is , however , my pleasure in presenting it to him , will be very great . pray assure him of it . ”
austen	sense	elinor ’ s astonishment at this commission could hardly have been greater , had the colonel been really making her an offer of his hand . the preferment , which only two days before she had considered as hopeless for edward , was already provided to enable him to marry ; and _she_ , of all people in the world , was fixed on to bestow it ! her emotion was such as mrs. jennings had attributed to a very different cause ; but whatever minor feelings less pure , less pleasing , might have a share in that emotion , her esteem for the general benevolence , and her gratitude for the particular friendship , which together prompted colonel brandon to this act , were strongly felt , and warmly expressed . she thanked him for it with all her heart , spoke of edward ’ s principles and disposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve ; and promised to undertake the commission with pleasure , if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office to another . but at the same time , she could not help thinking that no one could so well perform it as himself . it was an office in short , from which , unwilling to give edward the pain of receiving an obligation from _her_ , she would have been very glad to be spared herself ; but colonel brandon , on motives of equal delicacy , declining it likewise , still seemed so desirous of its being given through her means , that she would not on any account make farther opposition . edward , she believed , was still in town , and fortunately she had heard his address from miss steele . she could undertake therefore to inform him of it , in the course of the day . after this had been settled , colonel brandon began to talk of his own advantage in securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour , and _then_ it was that he mentioned with regret , that the house was small and indifferent ; an evil which elinor , as mrs. jennings had supposed her to do , made very light of , at least as far as regarded its size .
austen	sense	“ the smallness of the house , ” said she , “ i can not imagine any inconvenience to them , for it will be in proportion to their family and income. ” by which the colonel was surprised to find that _she_ was considering mr. ferrars ’ s marriage as the certain consequence of the presentation ; for he did not suppose it possible that delaford living could supply such an income , as anybody in his style of life would venture to settle on , and he said so .
austen	sense	“ this little rectory _can_ do no more than make mr. ferrars comfortable as a bachelor ; it can not enable him to marry . i am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this ; and my interest is hardly more extensive . if , however , by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve him farther , i must think very differently of him from what i now do , if i am not as ready to be useful to him then as i sincerely wish i could be at present . what i am now doing indeed , seems nothing at all , since it can advance him so little towards what must be his principal , his only object of happiness . his marriage must still be a distant good ; at least , i am afraid it can not take place very soon . ”
austen	sense	such was the sentence which , when misunderstood , so justly offended the delicate feelings of mrs. jennings ; but after this narration of what really passed between colonel brandon and elinor , while they stood at the window , the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting , may perhaps appear in general , not less reasonably excited , nor less properly worded than if it had arisen from an offer of marriage .
austen	sense	chapter xl . “ well , miss dashwood , ” said mrs. jennings , sagaciously smiling , as soon as the gentleman had withdrawn , “ i do not ask you what the colonel has been saying to you ; for though , upon my honour , i _tried_ to keep out of hearing , i could not help catching enough to understand his business . and i assure you i never was better pleased in my life , and i wish you joy of it with all my heart . ”
austen	sense	“ thank you , ma ’ am , ” said elinor . “ it _is_ a matter of great joy to me ; and i feel the goodness of colonel brandon most sensibly . there are not many men who would act as he has done . few people who have so compassionate a heart ! i never was more astonished in my life . ”
austen	sense	“ lord ! my dear , you are very modest . i an ’ t the least astonished at it in the world , for i have often thought of late , there was nothing more likely to happen . ”
austen	sense	“ you judged from your knowledge of the colonel ’ s general benevolence ; but at least you could not foresee that the opportunity would so very soon occur. ” “ opportunity ! ” repeated mrs. jennings— “ oh ! as to that , when a man has once made up his mind to such a thing , somehow or other he will soon find an opportunity . well , my dear , i wish you joy of it again and again ; and if ever there was a happy couple in the world , i think i shall soon know where to look for them . ”
austen	sense	“ you mean to go to delaford after them i suppose , ” said elinor , with a faint smile . “ aye , my dear , that i do , indeed . and as to the house being a bad one , i do not know what the colonel would be at , for it is as good a one as ever i saw . ”
austen	sense	“ he spoke of its being out of repair. ” “ well , and whose fault is that ? why don ’ t he repair it ? —who should do it but himself ? ” they were interrupted by the servant ’ s coming in to announce the carriage being at the door ; and mrs. jennings immediately preparing to go , said , —
austen	sense	“ well , my dear , i must be gone before i have had half my talk out . but , however , we may have it all over in the evening ; for we shall be quite alone . i do not ask you to go with me , for i dare say your mind is too full of the matter to care for company ; and besides , you must long to tell your sister all about it . ”
austen	sense	marianne had left the room before the conversation began . “ certainly , ma ’ am , i shall tell marianne of it ; but i shall not mention it at present to any body else. ” “ oh ! very well , ” said mrs. jennings rather disappointed . “ then you would not have me tell it to lucy , for i think of going as far as holborn to-day . ”
austen	sense	“ no , ma ’ am , not even lucy if you please . one day ’ s delay will not be very material ; and till i have written to mr. ferrars , i think it ought not to be mentioned to any body else . i shall do _that_ directly . it is of importance that no time should be lost with him , for he will of course have much to do relative to his ordination . ”
austen	sense	this speech at first puzzled mrs. jennings exceedingly . why mr. ferrars was to have been written to about it in such a hurry , she could not immediately comprehend . a few moments ’ reflection , however , produced a very happy idea , and she exclaimed ; —
austen	sense	“ oh , ho ! —i understand you . mr. ferrars is to be the man . well , so much the better for him . ay , to be sure , he must be ordained in readiness ; and i am very glad to find things are so forward between you . but , my dear , is not this rather out of character ? should not the colonel write himself ? —sure , he is the proper person . ”
austen	sense	elinor did not quite understand the beginning of mrs. jennings ’ s speech , neither did she think it worth inquiring into ; and therefore only replied to its conclusion . “ colonel brandon is so delicate a man , that he rather wished any one to announce his intentions to mr. ferrars than himself . ”
austen	sense	“ and so _you_ are forced to do it . well _that_ is an odd kind of delicacy ! however , i will not disturb you ( seeing her preparing to write . ) you know your own concerns best . so goodby , my dear . i have not heard of any thing to please me so well since charlotte was brought to bed . ”
austen	sense	and away she went ; but returning again in a moment , “ i have just been thinking of betty ’ s sister , my dear . i should be very glad to get her so good a mistress . but whether she would do for a lady ’ s maid , i am sure i can ’ t tell . she is an excellent housemaid , and works very well at her needle . however , you will think of all that at your leisure . ”
austen	sense	“ certainly , ma ’ am , ” replied elinor , not hearing much of what she said , and more anxious to be alone , than to be mistress of the subject . how she should begin—how she should express herself in her note to edward , was now all her concern . the particular circumstances between them made a difficulty of that which to any other person would have been the easiest thing in the world ; but she equally feared to say too much or too little , and sat deliberating over her paper , with the pen in her hand , till broken in on by the entrance of edward himself .
austen	sense	he had met mrs. jennings at the door in her way to the carriage , as he came to leave his farewell card ; and she , after apologising for not returning herself , had obliged him to enter , by saying that miss dashwood was above , and wanted to speak with him on very particular business .
austen	sense	elinor had just been congratulating herself , in the midst of her perplexity , that however difficult it might be to express herself properly by letter , it was at least preferable to giving the information by word of mouth , when her visitor entered , to force her upon this greatest exertion of all . her astonishment and confusion were very great on his so sudden appearance . she had not seen him before since his engagement became public , and therefore not since his knowing her to be acquainted with it ; which , with the consciousness of what she had been thinking of , and what she had to tell him , made her feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes . he too was much distressed ; and they sat down together in a most promising state of embarrassment.—whether he had asked her pardon for his intrusion on first coming into the room , he could not recollect ; but determining to be on the safe side , he made his apology in form as soon as he could say any thing , after taking a chair .
austen	sense	“ mrs . jennings told me , ” said he , “ that you wished to speak with me , at least i understood her so—or i certainly should not have intruded on you in such a manner ; though at the same time , i should have been extremely sorry to leave london without seeing you and your sister ; especially as it will most likely be some time—it is not probable that i should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again . i go to oxford tomorrow . ”
austen	sense	“ you would not have gone , however , ” said elinor , recovering herself , and determined to get over what she so much dreaded as soon as possible , “ without receiving our good wishes , even if we had not been able to give them in person . mrs. jennings was quite right in what she said . i have something of consequence to inform you of , which i was on the point of communicating by paper . i am charged with a most agreeable office ( breathing rather faster than usual as she spoke . ) colonel brandon , who was here only ten minutes ago , has desired me to say , that understanding you mean to take orders , he has great pleasure in offering you the living of delaford now just vacant , and only wishes it were more valuable . allow me to congratulate you on having so respectable and well-judging a friend , and to join in his wish that the living—it is about two hundred a-year—were much more considerable , and such as might better enable you to—as might be more than a temporary accommodation to yourself—such , in short , as might establish all your views of happiness . ”
austen	sense	what edward felt , as he could not say it himself , it can not be expected that any one else should say for him . he _looked_ all the astonishment which such unexpected , such unthought-of information could not fail of exciting ; but he said only these two words , —
austen	sense	“ colonel brandon ! ” “ yes , ” continued elinor , gathering more resolution , as some of the worst was over , “ colonel brandon means it as a testimony of his concern for what has lately passed—for the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you—a concern which i am sure marianne , myself , and all your friends , must share ; and likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character , and his particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion . ”
austen	sense	“ colonel brandon give _me_ a living ! —can it be possible ? ” “ the unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to find friendship any where. ” “ no , ” replied he , with sudden consciousness , “ not to find it in _you ; _ for i can not be ignorant that to you , to your goodness , i owe it all.—i feel it—i would express it if i could—but , as you well know , i am no orator . ”
austen	sense	“ you are very much mistaken . i do assure you that you owe it entirely , at least almost entirely , to your own merit , and colonel brandon ’ s discernment of it . i have had no hand in it . i did not even know , till i understood his design , that the living was vacant ; nor had it ever occurred to me that he might have had such a living in his gift . as a friend of mine , of my family , he may , perhaps—indeed i know he _has_ , still greater pleasure in bestowing it ; but , upon my word , you owe nothing to my solicitation . ”
austen	sense	truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share in the action , but she was at the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefactress of edward , that she acknowledged it with hesitation ; which probably contributed to fix that suspicion in his mind which had recently entered it . for a short time he sat deep in thought , after elinor had ceased to speak ; —at last , and as if it were rather an effort , he said ,
austen	sense	“ colonel brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability . i have always heard him spoken of as such , and your brother i know esteems him highly . he is undoubtedly a sensible man , and in his manners perfectly the gentleman . ”
austen	sense	“ indeed , ” replied elinor , “ i believe that you will find him , on farther acquaintance , all that you have heard him to be , and as you will be such very near neighbours ( for i understand the parsonage is almost close to the mansion-house , ) it is particularly important that he _should_ be all this . ”
austen	sense	edward made no answer ; but when she had turned away her head , gave her a look so serious , so earnest , so uncheerful , as seemed to say , that he might hereafter wish the distance between the parsonage and the mansion-house much greater .
austen	sense	“ colonel brandon , i think , lodges in st. james street , ” said he , soon afterwards , rising from his chair . elinor told him the number of the house . “ i must hurry away then , to give him those thanks which you will not allow me to give _you ; _ to assure him that he has made me a very—an exceedingly happy man . ”
austen	sense	elinor did not offer to detain him ; and they parted , with a very earnest assurance on _her_ side of her unceasing good wishes for his happiness in every change of situation that might befall him ; on _his_ , with rather an attempt to return the same good will , than the power of expressing it .
austen	sense	“ when i see him again , ” said elinor to herself , as the door shut him out , “ i shall see him the husband of lucy. ” and with this pleasing anticipation , she sat down to reconsider the past , recall the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings of edward ; and , of course , to reflect on her own with discontent .
austen	sense	when mrs. jennings came home , though she returned from seeing people whom she had never seen before , and of whom therefore she must have a great deal to say , her mind was so much more occupied by the important secret in her possession , than by anything else , that she reverted to it again as soon as elinor appeared .
austen	sense	“ well , my dear , ” she cried , “ i sent you up the young man . did not i do right ? —and i suppose you had no great difficulty—you did not find him very unwilling to accept your proposal ? ”
austen	sense	“ no , ma ’ am ; _that_ was not very likely. ” “ well , and how soon will he be ready ? —for it seems all to depend upon that. ” “ really , ” said elinor , “ i know so little of these kind of forms , that i can hardly even conjecture as to the time , or the preparation necessary ; but i suppose two or three months will complete his ordination . ”
austen	sense	“ two or three months ! ” cried mrs. jennings ; “ lord ! my dear , how calmly you talk of it ; and can the colonel wait two or three months ! lord bless me ! —i am sure it would put _me_ quite out of patience ! —and though one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor mr. ferrars , i do think it is not worth while to wait two or three months for him . sure somebody else might be found that would do as well ; somebody that is in orders already . ”
austen	sense	“ my dear ma ’ am , ” said elinor , “ what can you be thinking of ? why , colonel brandon ’ s only object is to be of use to mr. ferrars. ” “ lord bless you , my dear ! sure you do not mean to persuade me that the colonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to mr. ferrars ! ”
austen	sense	the deception could not continue after this ; and an explanation immediately took place , by which both gained considerable amusement for the moment , without any material loss of happiness to either , for mrs. jennings only exchanged one form of delight for another , and still without forfeiting her expectation of the first .
austen	sense	“ aye , aye , the parsonage is but a small one , ” said she , after the first ebullition of surprise and satisfaction was over , “ and very likely _may_ be out of repair ; but to hear a man apologising , as i thought , for a house that to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground-floor , and i think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds ! and to you too , that had been used to live in barton cottage ! it seems quite ridiculous . but , my dear , we must touch up the colonel to do some thing to the parsonage , and make it comfortable for them , before lucy goes to it . ”
austen	sense	“ but colonel brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living ’ s being enough to allow them to marry. ” “ the colonel is a ninny , my dear ; because he has two thousand a-year himself , he thinks that nobody else can marry on less . take my word for it , that , if i am alive , i shall be paying a visit at delaford parsonage before michaelmas ; and i am sure i shan ’ t go if lucy an ’ t there . ”
austen	sense	elinor was quite of her opinion , as to the probability of their not waiting for any thing more . chapter xli . edward , having carried his thanks to colonel brandon , proceeded with his happiness to lucy ; and such was the excess of it by the time he reached bartlett ’ s buildings , that she was able to assure mrs. jennings , who called on her again the next day with her congratulations , that she had never seen him in such spirits before in her life .
austen	sense	her own happiness , and her own spirits , were at least very certain ; and she joined mrs. jennings most heartily in her expectation of their being all comfortably together in delaford parsonage before michaelmas . so far was she , at the same time , from any backwardness to give elinor that credit which edward _would_ give her , that she spoke of her friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth , was ready to own all their obligation to her , and openly declared that no exertion for their good on miss dashwood ’ s part , either present or future , would ever surprise her , for she believed her capable of doing any thing in the world for those she really valued . as for colonel brandon , she was not only ready to worship him as a saint , but was moreover truly anxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly concerns ; anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost ; and secretly resolved to avail herself , at delaford , as far as she possibly could , of his servants , his carriage , his cows , and his poultry .
austen	sense	it was now above a week since john dashwood had called in berkeley street , and as since that time no notice had been taken by them of his wife ’ s indisposition , beyond one verbal enquiry , elinor began to feel it necessary to pay her a visit.—this was an obligation , however , which not only opposed her own inclination , but which had not the assistance of any encouragement from her companions . marianne , not contented with absolutely refusing to go herself , was very urgent to prevent her sister ’ s going at all ; and mrs. jennings , though her carriage was always at elinor ’ s service , so very much disliked mrs. john dashwood , that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after the late discovery , nor her strong desire to affront her by taking edward ’ s part , could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again . the consequence was , that elinor set out by herself to pay a visit , for which no one could really have less inclination , and to run the risk of a tête-à-tête with a woman , whom neither of the others had so much reason to dislike .
austen	sense	mrs. dashwood was denied ; but before the carriage could turn from the house , her husband accidentally came out . he expressed great pleasure in meeting elinor , told her that he had been just going to call in berkeley street , and , assuring her that fanny would be very glad to see her , invited her to come in .
austen	sense	they walked up stairs in to the drawing-room.—nobody was there . “ fanny is in her own room , i suppose , ” said he : “ i will go to her presently , for i am sure she will not have the least objection in the world to seeing _you_ . very far from it , indeed . _now_ especially there can not be—but however , you and marianne were always great favourites . why would not marianne come ? ”
austen	sense	elinor made what excuse she could for her . “ i am not sorry to see you alone , ” he replied , “ for i have a good deal to say to you . this living of colonel brandon ’ s—can it be true ? —has he really given it to edward ? —i heard it yesterday by chance , and was coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it . ”
austen	sense	“ it is perfectly true.—colonel brandon has given the living of delaford to edward. ” “ really ! —well , this is very astonishing ! —no relationship ! —no connection between them ! —and now that livings fetch such a price ! —what was the value of this ? ”
austen	sense	“ about two hundred a year. ” “ very well—and for the next presentation to a living of that value—supposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly , and likely to vacate it soon—he might have got i dare say—fourteen hundred pounds . and how came he not to have settled that matter before this person ’ s death ? _now_ , indeed it would be too late to sell it , but a man of colonel brandon ’ s sense ! i wonder he should be so improvident in a point of such common , such natural , concern ! well , i am convinced that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every human character . i suppose , however—on recollection—that the case may probably be _this_ . edward is only to hold the living till the person to whom the colonel has really sold the presentation , is old enough to take it . aye , aye , that is the fact , depend upon it . ”
austen	sense	elinor contradicted it , however , very positively ; and by relating that she had herself been employed in conveying the offer from colonel brandon to edward , and , therefore , must understand the terms on which it was given , obliged him to submit to her authority .
austen	sense	“ it is truly astonishing ! ” —he cried , after hearing what she said— “ what could be the colonel ’ s motive ? ” “ a very simple one—to be of use to mr. ferrars. ” “ well , well ; whatever colonel brandon may be , edward is a very lucky man.—you will not mention the matter to fanny , however , for though i have broke it to her , and she bears it vastly well , —she will not like to hear it much talked of . ”
austen	sense	elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing , that she thought fanny might have borne with composure , an acquisition of wealth to her brother , by which neither she nor her child could be possibly impoverished .
austen	sense	“ mrs . ferrars , ” added he , lowering his voice to the tone becoming so important a subject , “ knows nothing about it at present , and i believe it will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may be . when the marriage takes place , i fear she must hear of it all . ”
austen	sense	“ but why should such precaution be used ? though it is not to be supposed that mrs. ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has money enough to live upon , for _that_ must be quite out of the question ; yet why , upon her late behaviour , is she supposed to feel at all ? she has done with her son , —she cast him off for ever , and has made all those over whom she had any influence , cast him off likewise . surely , after doing so , she can not be imagined liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account : she can not be interested in any thing that befalls him . she would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort of a child , and yet retain the anxiety of a parent ! ”
austen	sense	“ ah ! elinor , ” said john , “ your reasoning is very good , but it is founded on ignorance of human nature . when edward ’ s unhappy match takes place , depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him ; and , therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that dreadful event , must be concealed from her as much as possible . mrs. ferrars can never forget that edward is her son . ”
austen	sense	“ you surprise me ; i should think it must nearly have escaped her memory by _this_ time. ” “ you wrong her exceedingly . mrs. ferrars is one of the most affectionate mothers in the world . ”
austen	sense	elinor was silent . “ we think _now_ , ” —said mr. dashwood , after a short pause , “ of _robert ’ s_ marrying miss morton. ” elinor , smiling at the grave and decisive importance of her brother ’ s tone , calmly replied , —
austen	sense	“ the lady , i suppose , has no choice in the affair. ” “ choice ! —how do you mean ? ” “ i only mean that i suppose , from your manner of speaking , it must be the same to miss morton whether she marry edward or robert . ”
austen	sense	“ certainly , there can be no difference ; for robert will now to all intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son ; —and as to any thing else , they are both very agreeable young men : i do not know that one is superior to the other . ”
austen	sense	elinor said no more , and john was also for a short time silent.—his reflections ended thus . “ of _one_ thing , my dear sister , ” kindly taking her hand , and speaking in an awful whisper , “ i may assure you ; —and i _will_ do it , because i know it must gratify you . i have good reason to think—indeed i have it from the best authority , or i should not repeat it , for otherwise it would be very wrong to say any thing about it , —but i have it from the very best authority , —not that i ever precisely heard mrs. ferrars say it herself—but her daughter _did_ , and i have it from her , —that in short , whatever objections there might be against a certain—a certain connection , you understand me , —it would have been far preferable to her , —it would not have given her half the vexation that _this_ does . i was exceedingly pleased to hear that mrs. ferrars considered it in that light ; a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all . ‘ it would have been beyond comparison , ’ she said , ‘ the least evil of the two , and she would be glad to compound _now_ for nothing worse. ’ but however , all that is quite out of the question , —not to be thought of or mentioned—as to any attachment you know , it never could be : all that is gone by . but i thought i would just tell you of this , because i knew how much it must please you . not that you have any reason to regret , my dear elinor . there is no doubt of your doing exceedingly well , —quite as well , or better , perhaps , all things considered . has colonel brandon been with you lately ? ”
austen	sense	elinor had heard enough , if not to gratify her vanity , and raise her self-importance , to agitate her nerves and fill her mind ; —and she was therefore glad to be spared from the necessity of saying much in reply herself , and from the danger of hearing any thing more from her brother , by the entrance of mr. robert ferrars . after a few moments ’ chat , john dashwood , recollecting that fanny was yet uninformed of her sister ’ s being there , quitted the room in quest of her ; and elinor was left to improve her acquaintance with robert , who , by the gay unconcern , the happy self-complacency of his manner while enjoying so unfair a division of his mother ’ s love and liberality , to the prejudice of his banished brother , earned only by his own dissipated course of life , and that brother ’ s integrity , was confirming her most unfavourable opinion of his head and heart .
austen	sense	they had scarcely been two minutes by themselves , before he began to speak of edward ; for he , too , had heard of the living , and was very inquisitive on the subject . elinor repeated the particulars of it , as she had given them to john ; and their effect on robert , though very different , was not less striking than it had been on _him_ . he laughed most immoderately . the idea of edward ’ s being a clergyman , and living in a small parsonage-house , diverted him beyond measure ; —and when to that was added the fanciful imagery of edward reading prayers in a white surplice , and publishing the banns of marriage between john smith and mary brown , he could conceive nothing more ridiculous .
austen	sense	elinor , while she waited in silence and immovable gravity , the conclusion of such folly , could not restrain her eyes from being fixed on him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited . it was a look , however , very well bestowed , for it relieved her own feelings , and gave no intelligence to him . he was recalled from wit to wisdom , not by any reproof of hers , but by his own sensibility .
austen	sense	“ we may treat it as a joke , ” said he , at last , recovering from the affected laugh which had considerably lengthened out the genuine gaiety of the moment ; “ but , upon my soul , it is a most serious business . poor edward ! he is ruined for ever . i am extremely sorry for it ; for i know him to be a very good-hearted creature ; as well-meaning a fellow perhaps , as any in the world . you must not judge of him , miss dashwood , from _your_ slight acquaintance . poor edward ! his manners are certainly not the happiest in nature . but we are not all born , you know , with the same powers , —the same address . poor fellow ! to see him in a circle of strangers ! to be sure it was pitiable enough ; but upon my soul , i believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom ; and i declare and protest to you i never was so shocked in my life , as when it all burst forth . i could not believe it . my mother was the first person who told me of it ; and i , feeling myself called on to act with resolution , immediately said to her , ‘ my dear madam , i do not know what you may intend to do on the occasion , but as for myself , i must say , that if edward does marry this young woman , _i_ never will see him again. ’ that was what i said immediately . i was most uncommonly shocked , indeed ! poor edward ! he has done for himself completely , —shut himself out for ever from all decent society ! but , as i directly said to my mother , i am not in the least surprised at it ; from his style of education , it was always to be expected . my poor mother was half frantic . ”
austen	sense	“ have you ever seen the lady ? ” “ yes ; once , while she was staying in this house , i happened to drop in for ten minutes ; and i saw quite enough of her . the merest awkward country girl , without style , or elegance , and almost without beauty . i remember her perfectly . just the kind of girl i should suppose likely to captivate poor edward . i offered immediately , as soon as my mother related the affair to me , to talk to him myself , and dissuade him from the match ; but it was too late _then_ , i found , to do any thing , for unluckily , i was not in the way at first , and knew nothing of it till after the breach had taken place , when it was not for me , you know , to interfere . but had i been informed of it a few hours earlier , i think it is most probable that something might have been hit on . i certainly should have represented it to edward in a very strong light . ‘ my dear fellow , ’ i should have said , ‘ consider what you are doing . you are making a most disgraceful connection , and such a one as your family are unanimous in disapproving. ’ i can not help thinking , in short , that means might have been found . but now it is all too late . he must be starved , you know , that is certain ; absolutely starved . ”
austen	sense	he had just settled this point with great composure , when the entrance of mrs. john dashwood put an end to the subject . but though _she_ never spoke of it out of her own family , elinor could see its influence on her mind , in the something like confusion of countenance with which she entered , and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself . she even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that elinor and her sister were so soon to leave town , as she had hoped to see more of them ; —an exertion in which her husband , who attended her into the room , and hung enamoured over her accents , seemed to distinguish every thing that was most affectionate and graceful .
austen	sense	chapter xlii . one other short call in harley street , in which elinor received her brother ’ s congratulations on their travelling so far towards barton without any expense , and on colonel brandon ’ s being to follow them to cleveland in a day or two , completed the intercourse of the brother and sisters in town ; —and a faint invitation from fanny , to come to norland whenever it should happen to be in their way , which of all things was the most unlikely to occur , with a more warm , though less public , assurance , from john to elinor , of the promptitude with which he should come to see her at delaford , was all that foretold any meeting in the country .
austen	sense	it amused her to observe that all her friends seemed determined to send her to delaford ; —a place , in which , of all others , she would now least chuse to visit , or wish to reside ; for not only was it considered as her future home by her brother and mrs. jennings , but even lucy , when they parted , gave her a pressing invitation to visit her there .
austen	sense	very early in april , and tolerably early in the day , the two parties from hanover square and berkeley street set out from their respective homes , to meet , by appointment , on the road . for the convenience of charlotte and her child , they were to be more than two days on their journey , and mr. palmer , travelling more expeditiously with colonel brandon , was to join them at cleveland soon after their arrival .
austen	sense	marianne , few as had been her hours of comfort in london , and eager as she had long been to quit it , could not , when it came to the point , bid adieu to the house in which she had for the last time enjoyed those hopes , and that confidence , in willoughby , which were now extinguished for ever , without great pain . nor could she leave the place in which willoughby remained , busy in new engagements , and new schemes , in which _she_ could have no share , without shedding many tears .
austen	sense	elinor ’ s satisfaction , at the moment of removal , was more positive . she had no such object for her lingering thoughts to fix on , she left no creature behind , from whom it would give her a moment ’ s regret to be divided for ever , she was pleased to be free herself from the persecution of lucy ’ s friendship , she was grateful for bringing her sister away unseen by willoughby since his marriage , and she looked forward with hope to what a few months of tranquility at barton might do towards restoring marianne ’ s peace of mind , and confirming her own .
austen	sense	their journey was safely performed . the second day brought them into the cherished , or the prohibited , county of somerset , for as such was it dwelt on by turns in marianne ’ s imagination ; and in the forenoon of the third they drove up to cleveland .
austen	sense	cleveland was a spacious , modern-built house , situated on a sloping lawn . it had no park , but the pleasure-grounds were tolerably extensive ; and like every other place of the same degree of importance , it had its open shrubbery , and closer wood walk , a road of smooth gravel winding round a plantation , led to the front , the lawn was dotted over with timber , the house itself was under the guardianship of the fir , the mountain-ash , and the acacia , and a thick screen of them altogether , interspersed with tall lombardy poplars , shut out the offices .
austen	sense	marianne entered the house with a heart swelling with emotion from the consciousness of being only eighty miles from barton , and not thirty from combe magna ; and before she had been five minutes within its walls , while the others were busily helping charlotte to show her child to the housekeeper , she quitted it again , stealing away through the winding shrubberies , now just beginning to be in beauty , to gain a distant eminence ; where , from its grecian temple , her eye , wandering over a wide tract of country to the south-east , could fondly rest on the farthest ridge of hills in the horizon , and fancy that from their summits combe magna might be seen .
austen	sense	in such moments of precious , invaluable misery , she rejoiced in tears of agony to be at cleveland ; and as she returned by a different circuit to the house , feeling all the happy privilege of country liberty , of wandering from place to place in free and luxurious solitude , she resolved to spend almost every hour of every day while she remained with the palmers , in the indulgence of such solitary rambles .
austen	sense	she returned just in time to join the others as they quitted the house , on an excursion through its more immediate premises ; and the rest of the morning was easily whiled away , in lounging round the kitchen garden , examining the bloom upon its walls , and listening to the gardener ’ s lamentations upon blights , in dawdling through the green-house , where the loss of her favourite plants , unwarily exposed , and nipped by the lingering frost , raised the laughter of charlotte , —and in visiting her poultry-yard , where , in the disappointed hopes of her dairy-maid , by hens forsaking their nests , or being stolen by a fox , or in the rapid decrease of a promising young brood , she found fresh sources of merriment .
austen	sense	the morning was fine and dry , and marianne , in her plan of employment abroad , had not calculated for any change of weather during their stay at cleveland . with great surprise therefore , did she find herself prevented by a settled rain from going out again after dinner . she had depended on a twilight walk to the grecian temple , and perhaps all over the grounds , and an evening merely cold or damp would not have deterred her from it ; but a heavy and settled rain even _she_ could not fancy dry or pleasant weather for walking .
austen	sense	their party was small , and the hours passed quietly away . mrs. palmer had her child , and mrs. jennings her carpet-work ; they talked of the friends they had left behind , arranged lady middleton ’ s engagements , and wondered whether mr. palmer and colonel brandon would get farther than reading that night . elinor , however little concerned in it , joined in their discourse ; and marianne , who had the knack of finding her way in every house to the library , however it might be avoided by the family in general , soon procured herself a book .
austen	sense	nothing was wanting on mrs. palmer ’ s side that constant and friendly good humour could do , to make them feel themselves welcome . the openness and heartiness of her manner more than atoned for that want of recollection and elegance which made her often deficient in the forms of politeness ; her kindness , recommended by so pretty a face , was engaging ; her folly , though evident was not disgusting , because it was not conceited ; and elinor could have forgiven every thing but her laugh .
austen	sense	the two gentlemen arrived the next day to a very late dinner , affording a pleasant enlargement of the party , and a very welcome variety to their conversation , which a long morning of the same continued rain had reduced very low .
austen	sense	elinor had seen so little of mr. palmer , and in that little had seen so much variety in his address to her sister and herself , that she knew not what to expect to find him in his own family . she found him , however , perfectly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his visitors , and only occasionally rude to his wife and her mother ; she found him very capable of being a pleasant companion , and only prevented from being so always , by too great an aptitude to fancy himself as much superior to people in general , as he must feel himself to be to mrs. jennings and charlotte . for the rest of his character and habits , they were marked , as far as elinor could perceive , with no traits at all unusual in his sex and time of life . he was nice in his eating , uncertain in his hours ; fond of his child , though affecting to slight it ; and idled away the mornings at billiards , which ought to have been devoted to business . she liked him , however , upon the whole , much better than she had expected , and in her heart was not sorry that she could like him no more ; —not sorry to be driven by the observation of his epicurism , his selfishness , and his conceit , to rest with complacency on the remembrance of edward ’ s generous temper , simple taste , and diffident feelings .
austen	sense	of edward , or at least of some of his concerns , she now received intelligence from colonel brandon , who had been into dorsetshire lately ; and who , treating her at once as the disinterested friend of mr. ferrars , and the kind confidante of himself , talked to her a great deal of the parsonage at delaford , described its deficiencies , and told her what he meant to do himself towards removing them.—his behaviour to her in this , as well as in every other particular , his open pleasure in meeting her after an absence of only ten days , his readiness to converse with her , and his deference for her opinion , might very well justify mrs. jennings ’ s persuasion of his attachment , and would have been enough , perhaps , had not elinor still , as from the first , believed marianne his real favourite , to make her suspect it herself . but as it was , such a notion had scarcely ever entered her head , except by mrs. jennings ’ s suggestion ; and she could not help believing herself the nicest observer of the two ; —she watched his eyes , while mrs. jennings thought only of his behaviour ; —and while his looks of anxious solicitude on marianne ’ s feeling , in her head and throat , the beginning of a heavy cold , because unexpressed by words , entirely escaped the latter lady ’ s observation ; —_she_ could discover in them the quick feelings , and needless alarm of a lover .
austen	sense	two delightful twilight walks on the third and fourth evenings of her being there , not merely on the dry gravel of the shrubbery , but all over the grounds , and especially in the most distant parts of them , where there was something more of wildness than in the rest , where the trees were the oldest , and the grass was the longest and wettest , had—assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting in her wet shoes and stockings—given marianne a cold so violent as , though for a day or two trifled with or denied , would force itself by increasing ailments on the concern of every body , and the notice of herself . prescriptions poured in from all quarters , and as usual , were all declined . though heavy and feverish , with a pain in her limbs , and a cough , and a sore throat , a good night ’ s rest was to cure her entirely ; and it was with difficulty that elinor prevailed on her , when she went to bed , to try one or two of the simplest of the remedies .
austen	sense	chapter xliii . marianne got up the next morning at her usual time ; to every inquiry replied that she was better , and tried to prove herself so , by engaging in her accustomary employments . but a day spent in sitting shivering over the fire with a book in her hand , which she was unable to read , or in lying , weary and languid , on a sofa , did not speak much in favour of her amendment ; and when , at last , she went early to bed , more and more indisposed , colonel brandon was only astonished at her sister ’ s composure , who , though attending and nursing her the whole day , against marianne ’ s inclination , and forcing proper medicines on her at night , trusted , like marianne , to the certainty and efficacy of sleep , and felt no real alarm .
austen	sense	a very restless and feverish night , however , disappointed the expectation of both ; and when marianne , after persisting in rising , confessed herself unable to sit up , and returned voluntarily to her bed , elinor was very ready to adopt mrs. jennings ’ s advice , of sending for the palmers ’ apothecary .
austen	sense	he came , examined his patient , and though encouraging miss dashwood to expect that a very few days would restore her sister to health , yet , by pronouncing her disorder to have a putrid tendency , and allowing the word “ infection ” to pass his lips , gave instant alarm to mrs. palmer , on her baby ’ s account . mrs. jennings , who had been inclined from the first to think marianne ’ s complaint more serious than elinor , now looked very grave on mr. harris ’ s report , and confirming charlotte ’ s fears and caution , urged the necessity of her immediate removal with her infant ; and mr. palmer , though treating their apprehensions as idle , found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great to be withstood . her departure , therefore , was fixed on ; and within an hour after mr. harris ’ s arrival , she set off , with her little boy and his nurse , for the house of a near relation of mr. palmer ’ s , who lived a few miles on the other side of bath ; whither her husband promised , at her earnest entreaty , to join her in a day or two ; and whither she was almost equally urgent with her mother to accompany her . mrs. jennings , however , with a kindness of heart which made elinor really love her , declared her resolution of not stirring from cleveland as long as marianne remained ill , and of endeavouring , by her own attentive care , to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from ; and elinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate , desirous to share in all her fatigues , and often by her better experience in nursing , of material use .
austen	sense	poor marianne , languid and low from the nature of her malady , and feeling herself universally ill , could no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered ; and the idea of what tomorrow would have produced , but for this unlucky illness , made every ailment severe ; for on that day they were to have begun their journey home ; and , attended the whole way by a servant of mrs. jennings , were to have taken their mother by surprise on the following forenoon . the little she said was all in lamentation of this inevitable delay ; though elinor tried to raise her spirits , and make her believe , as she _then_ really believed herself , that it would be a very short one .
austen	sense	the next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the patient ; she certainly was not better , and , except that there was no amendment , did not appear worse . their party was now farther reduced ; for mr. palmer , though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity and good-nature , as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away by his wife , was persuaded at last by colonel brandon to perform his promise of following her ; and while he was preparing to go , colonel brandon himself , with a much greater exertion , began to talk of going likewise.—here , however , the kindness of mrs. jennings interposed most acceptably ; for to send the colonel away while his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister ’ s account , would be to deprive them both , she thought , of every comfort ; and therefore telling him at once that his stay at cleveland was necessary to herself , that she should want him to play at piquet of an evening , while miss dashwood was above with her sister , & c. she urged him so strongly to remain , that he , who was gratifying the first wish of his own heart by a compliance , could not long even affect to demur ; especially as mrs. jennings ’ s entreaty was warmly seconded by mr. palmer , who seemed to feel a relief to himself , in leaving behind him a person so well able to assist or advise miss dashwood in any emergence .
austen	sense	marianne was , of course , kept in ignorance of all these arrangements . she knew not that she had been the means of sending the owners of cleveland away , in about seven days from the time of their arrival . it gave her no surprise that she saw nothing of mrs. palmer ; and as it gave her likewise no concern , she never mentioned her name .
austen	sense	two days passed away from the time of mr. palmer ’ s departure , and her situation continued , with little variation , the same . mr. harris , who attended her every day , still talked boldly of a speedy recovery , and miss dashwood was equally sanguine ; but the expectation of the others was by no means so cheerful . mrs. jennings had determined very early in the seizure that marianne would never get over it , and colonel brandon , who was chiefly of use in listening to mrs. jennings ’ s forebodings , was not in a state of mind to resist their influence . he tried to reason himself out of fears , which the different judgment of the apothecary seemed to render absurd ; but the many hours of each day in which he was left entirely alone , were but too favourable for the admission of every melancholy idea , and he could not expel from his mind the persuasion that he should see marianne no more .
austen	sense	on the morning of the third day however , the gloomy anticipations of both were almost done away ; for when mr. harris arrived , he declared his patient materially better . her pulse was much stronger , and every symptom more favourable than on the preceding visit . elinor , confirmed in every pleasant hope , was all cheerfulness ; rejoicing that in her letters to her mother , she had pursued her own judgment rather than her friend ’ s , in making very light of the indisposition which delayed them at cleveland ; and almost fixing on the time when marianne would be able to travel .
austen	sense	but the day did not close so auspiciously as it began . towards the evening marianne became ill again , growing more heavy , restless , and uncomfortable than before . her sister , however , still sanguine , was willing to attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue of having sat up to have her bed made ; and carefully administering the cordials prescribed , saw her , with satisfaction , sink at last into a slumber , from which she expected the most beneficial effects . her sleep , though not so quiet as elinor wished to see it , lasted a considerable time ; and anxious to observe the result of it herself , she resolved to sit with her during the whole of it . mrs. jennings , knowing nothing of any change in the patient , went unusually early to bed ; her maid , who was one of the principal nurses , was recreating herself in the housekeeper ’ s room , and elinor remained alone with marianne .
austen	sense	the repose of the latter became more and more disturbed ; and her sister , who watched , with unremitting attention her continual change of posture , and heard the frequent but inarticulate sounds of complaint which passed her lips , was almost wishing to rouse her from so painful a slumber , when marianne , suddenly awakened by some accidental noise in the house , started hastily up , and , with feverish wildness , cried out , —
austen	sense	“ is mama coming ? ” “ not yet , ” cried the other , concealing her terror , and assisting marianne to lie down again , “ but she will be here , i hope , before it is long . it is a great way , you know , from hence to barton . ”
austen	sense	“ but she must not go round by london , ” cried marianne , in the same hurried manner . “ i shall never see her , if she goes by london. ” elinor perceived with alarm that she was not quite herself , and , while attempting to soothe her , eagerly felt her pulse . it was lower and quicker than ever ! and marianne , still talking wildly of mama , her alarm increased so rapidly , as to determine her on sending instantly for mr. harris , and despatching a messenger to barton for her mother . to consult with colonel brandon on the best means of effecting the latter , was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of its performance ; and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place by her sister , she hastened down to the drawing-room , where she knew he was generally to be found at a much later hour than the present .
austen	sense	it was no time for hesitation . her fears and her difficulties were immediately before him . her fears , he had no courage , no confidence to attempt the removal of : —he listened to them in silent despondence ; —but her difficulties were instantly obviated , for with a readiness that seemed to speak the occasion , and the service pre-arranged in his mind , he offered himself as the messenger who should fetch mrs. dashwood . elinor made no resistance that was not easily overcome . she thanked him with brief , though fervent gratitude , and while he went to hurry off his servant with a message to mr. harris , and an order for post-horses directly , she wrote a few lines to her mother .
austen	sense	the comfort of such a friend at that moment as colonel brandon—or such a companion for her mother , —how gratefully was it felt ! —a companion whose judgment would guide , whose attendance must relieve , and whose friendship might soothe her ! —as far as the shock of such a summons _could_ be lessened to her , his presence , his manners , his assistance , would lessen it .
austen	sense	_he_ , meanwhile , whatever he might feel , acted with all the firmness of a collected mind , made every necessary arrangement with the utmost despatch , and calculated with exactness the time in which she might look for his return . not a moment was lost in delay of any kind . the horses arrived , even before they were expected , and colonel brandon only pressing her hand with a look of solemnity , and a few words spoken too low to reach her ear , hurried into the carriage . it was then about twelve o ’ clock , and she returned to her sister ’ s apartment to wait for the arrival of the apothecary , and to watch by her the rest of the night . it was a night of almost equal suffering to both . hour after hour passed away in sleepless pain and delirium on marianne ’ s side , and in the most cruel anxiety on elinor ’ s , before mr. harris appeared . her apprehensions once raised , paid by their excess for all her former security ; and the servant who sat up with her , for she would not allow mrs. jennings to be called , only tortured her more , by hints of what her mistress had always thought .
austen	sense	marianne ’ s ideas were still , at intervals , fixed incoherently on her mother , and whenever she mentioned her name , it gave a pang to the heart of poor elinor , who , reproaching herself for having trifled with so many days of illness , and wretched for some immediate relief , fancied that all relief might soon be in vain , that every thing had been delayed too long , and pictured to herself her suffering mother arriving too late to see this darling child , or to see her rational .
austen	sense	she was on the point of sending again for mr. harris , or if _he_ could not come , for some other advice , when the former—but not till after five o ’ clock—arrived . his opinion , however , made some little amends for his delay , for though acknowledging a very unexpected and unpleasant alteration in his patient , he would not allow the danger to be material , and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment must procure , with a confidence which , in a lesser degree , was communicated to elinor . he promised to call again in the course of three or four hours , and left both the patient and her anxious attendant more composed than he had found them .
austen	sense	with strong concern , and with many reproaches for not being called to their aid , did mrs. jennings hear in the morning of what had passed . her former apprehensions , now with greater reason restored , left her no doubt of the event ; and though trying to speak comfort to elinor , her conviction of her sister ’ s danger would not allow her to offer the comfort of hope . her heart was really grieved . the rapid decay , the early death of a girl so young , so lovely as marianne , must have struck a less interested person with concern . on mrs. jennings ’ s compassion she had other claims . she had been for three months her companion , was still under her care , and she was known to have been greatly injured , and long unhappy . the distress of her sister too , particularly a favourite , was before her ; —and as for their mother , when mrs. jennings considered that marianne might probably be to _her_ what charlotte was to herself , her sympathy in _her_ sufferings was very sincere .
austen	sense	mr. harris was punctual in his second visit ; —but he came to be disappointed in his hopes of what the last would produce . his medicines had failed ; —the fever was unabated ; and marianne only more quiet—not more herself—remained in a heavy stupor . elinor , catching all , and more than all , his fears in a moment , proposed to call in further advice . but he judged it unnecessary : he had still something more to try , some more fresh application , of whose success he was as confident as the last , and his visit concluded with encouraging assurances which reached the ear , but could not enter the heart of miss dashwood . she was calm , except when she thought of her mother ; but she was almost hopeless ; and in this state she continued till noon , scarcely stirring from her sister ’ s bed , her thoughts wandering from one image of grief , one suffering friend to another , and her spirits oppressed to the utmost by the conversation of mrs. jennings , who scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack to the many weeks of previous indisposition which marianne ’ s disappointment had brought on . elinor felt all the reasonableness of the idea , and it gave fresh misery to her reflections .
austen	sense	about noon , however , she began—but with a caution—a dread of disappointment which for some time kept her silent , even to her friend—to fancy , to hope she could perceive a slight amendment in her sister ’ s pulse ; —she waited , watched , and examined it again and again ; —and at last , with an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior calmness , than all her foregoing distress , ventured to communicate her hopes . mrs. jennings , though forced , on examination , to acknowledge a temporary revival , tried to keep her young friend from indulging a thought of its continuance ; —and elinor , conning over every injunction of distrust , told herself likewise not to hope . but it was too late . hope had already entered ; and feeling all its anxious flutter , she bent over her sister to watch—she hardly knew for what . half an hour passed away , and the favourable symptom yet blessed her . others even arose to confirm it . her breath , her skin , her lips , all flattered elinor with signs of amendment ; and marianne fixed her eyes on her with a rational , though languid , gaze . anxiety and hope now oppressed her in equal degrees , and left her no moment of tranquillity till the arrival of mr. harris at four o ’ clock ; —when his assurances , his felicitations on a recovery in her sister even surpassing his expectation , gave her confidence , comfort , and tears of joy .
austen	sense	marianne was in every respect materially better , and he declared her entirely out of danger . mrs. jennings , perhaps satisfied with the partial justification of her forebodings which had been found in their late alarm , allowed herself to trust in his judgment , and admitted , with unfeigned joy , and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness , the probability of an entire recovery .
austen	sense	elinor could not be cheerful . her joy was of a different kind , and led to any thing rather than to gaiety . marianne restored to life , health , friends , and to her doting mother , was an idea to fill her heart with sensations of exquisite comfort , and expand it in fervent gratitude ; —but it led to no outward demonstrations of joy , no words , no smiles . all within elinor ’ s breast was satisfaction , silent and strong .
austen	sense	she continued by the side of her sister , with little intermission the whole afternoon , calming every fear , satisfying every inquiry of her enfeebled spirits , supplying every succour , and watching almost every look and every breath . the possibility of a relapse would of course , in some moments , occur to remind her of what anxiety was—but when she saw , on her frequent and minute examination , that every symptom of recovery continued , and saw marianne at six o ’ clock sink into a quiet , steady , and to all appearance comfortable , sleep , she silenced every doubt .
austen	sense	the time was now drawing on , when colonel brandon might be expected back . at ten o ’ clock , she trusted , or at least not much later her mother would be relieved from the dreadful suspense in which she must now be travelling towards them . the colonel , too ! —perhaps scarcely less an object of pity ! —oh ! —how slow was the progress of time which yet kept them in ignorance !
austen	sense	at seven o ’ clock , leaving marianne still sweetly asleep , she joined mrs. jennings in the drawing-room to tea . of breakfast she had been kept by her fears , and of dinner by their sudden reverse , from eating much ; —and the present refreshment , therefore , with such feelings of content as she brought to it , was particularly welcome . mrs. jennings would have persuaded her , at its conclusion , to take some rest before her mother ’ s arrival , and allow _her_ to take her place by marianne ; but elinor had no sense of fatigue , no capability of sleep at that moment about her , and she was not to be kept away from her sister an unnecessary instant . mrs. jennings therefore attending her up stairs into the sick chamber , to satisfy herself that all continued right , left her there again to her charge and her thoughts , and retired to her own room to write letters and sleep .
austen	sense	the night was cold and stormy . the wind roared round the house , and the rain beat against the windows ; but elinor , all happiness within , regarded it not . marianne slept through every blast ; and the travellers—they had a rich reward in store , for every present inconvenience .
austen	sense	the clock struck eight . had it been ten , elinor would have been convinced that at that moment she heard a carriage driving up to the house ; and so strong was the persuasion that she _did_ , in spite of the _almost_ impossibility of their being already come , that she moved into the adjoining dressing-closet and opened a window shutter , to be satisfied of the truth . she instantly saw that her ears had not deceived her . the flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in view . by their uncertain light she thought she could discern it to be drawn by four horses ; and this , while it told the excess of her poor mother ’ s alarm , gave some explanation to such unexpected rapidity .
austen	sense	never in her life had elinor found it so difficult to be calm , as at that moment . the knowledge of what her mother must be feeling as the carriage stopt at the door—of her doubt—her dread—perhaps her despair ! —and of what _she_ had to tell ! —with such knowledge it was impossible to be calm . all that remained to be done was to be speedy ; and , therefore staying only till she could leave mrs. jennings ’ s maid with her sister , she hurried down stairs .
austen	sense	the bustle in the vestibule , as she passed along an inner lobby , assured her that they were already in the house . she rushed to the drawing-room , —she entered it , —and saw only willoughby .
austen	sense	chapter xliv . elinor , starting back with a look of horror at the sight of him , obeyed the first impulse of her heart in turning instantly to quit the room , and her hand was already on the lock , when its action was suspended by his hastily advancing , and saying , in a voice rather of command than supplication ,
austen	sense	“ miss dashwood , for half an hour—for ten minutes—i entreat you to stay. ” “ no , sir , ” she replied with firmness , “ i shall _not_ stay . your business can not be with _me_ . the servants , i suppose , forgot to tell you that mr. palmer was not in the house . ”
austen	sense	“ had they told me , ” he cried with vehemence , “ that mr. palmer and all his relations were at the devil , it would not have turned me from the door . my business is with you , and only you . ”
austen	sense	“ with me ! ” —in the utmost amazement— “ well , sir , —be quick—and if you can—less violent. ” “ sit down , and i will be both. ” she hesitated ; she knew not what to do . the possibility of colonel brandon ’ s arriving and finding her there , came across her . but she had promised to hear him , and her curiosity no less than her honor was engaged . after a moment ’ s recollection , therefore , concluding that prudence required dispatch , and that her acquiescence would best promote it , she walked silently towards the table , and sat down . he took the opposite chair , and for half a minute not a word was said by either .
austen	sense	“ pray be quick , sir , ” —said elinor , impatiently ; — “ i have no time to spare. ” he was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation , and seemed not to hear her . “ your sister , ” said he , with abruptness , a moment afterwards— “ is out of danger . i heard it from the servant . god be praised ! —but is it true ? is it really true ? ”
austen	sense	elinor would not speak . he repeated the inquiry with yet greater eagerness . “ for god ’ s sake tell me , is she out of danger , or is she not ? ” “ we hope she is . ”
austen	sense	he rose up , and walked across the room . “ had i known as much half an hour ago ; —but since i _am_ here , ” speaking with a forced vivacity as he returned to his seat , — “ what does it signify ? for once , miss dashwood—it will be the last time , perhaps—let us be cheerful together . i am in a fine mood for gaiety . tell me honestly ” a deeper glow overspreading his cheeks , “ do you think me most a knave or a fool ? ”
austen	sense	elinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever . she began to think that he must be in liquor ; —the strangeness of such a visit , and of such manners , seemed no otherwise intelligible ; and with this impression she immediately rose , saying ,
austen	sense	“ mr . willoughby , i advise you at present to return to combe . i am not at leisure to remain with you longer . whatever your business may be with me , it will be better recollected and explained to-morrow . ”
austen	sense	“ i understand you , ” he replied , with an expressive smile , and a voice perfectly calm ; “ yes , i am very drunk . a pint of porter with my cold beef at marlborough was enough to over-set me . ”
austen	sense	“ at marlborough ! ” —cried elinor , more and more at a loss to understand what he would be at . “ yes , —i left london this morning at eight o ’ clock , and the only ten minutes i have spent out of my chaise since that time procured me a nuncheon at marlborough . ”
austen	sense	the steadiness of his manner , and the intelligence of his eye as he spoke , convincing elinor , that whatever other unpardonable folly might bring him to cleveland , he was not brought there by intoxication , she said , after a moment ’ s recollection ,
austen	sense	“ mr . willoughby , you _ought_ to feel , and i certainly _do_ , that after what has passed , your coming here in this manner , and forcing yourself upon my notice , requires a very particular excuse . what is it , that you mean by it ? ”
austen	sense	“ i mean , ” said he , with serious energy , “ if i can , to make you hate me one degree less than you do _now_ . i mean to offer some kind of explanation , some kind of apology , for the past ; to open my whole heart to you , and by convincing you , that though i have been always a blockhead , i have not been always a rascal , to obtain something like forgiveness from ma— from your sister . ”
austen	sense	“ is this the real reason of your coming ? ” “ upon my soul it is , ” —was his answer , with a warmth which brought all the former willoughby to her remembrance , and in spite of herself made her think him sincere .
austen	sense	“ if that is all , you may be satisfied already ; for marianne _does_ , she has _long_ forgiven you. ” “ has she ? ” he cried , in the same eager tone . “ then she has forgiven me before she ought to have done it . but she shall forgive me again , and on more reasonable grounds . _now_ will you listen to me ? ”
austen	sense	elinor bowed her assent . “ i do not know , ” said he , after a pause of expectation on her side , and thoughtfulness on his own , “ how _you_ may have accounted for my behaviour to your sister , or what diabolical motive you may have imputed to me . perhaps you will hardly think the better of me , —it is worth the trial however , and you shall hear every thing . when i first became intimate in your family , i had no other intention , no other view in the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while i was obliged to remain in devonshire , more pleasantly than i had ever done before . your sister ’ s lovely person and interesting manners could not but please me ; and her behaviour to me almost from the first , was of a kind—it is astonishing , when i reflect on what it was , and what _she_ was , that my heart should have been so insensible ! but at first i must confess , my vanity only was elevated by it . careless of her happiness , thinking only of my own amusement , giving way to feelings which i had always been too much in the habit of indulging , i endeavoured , by every means in my power , to make myself pleasing to her , without any design of returning her affection . ”
austen	sense	miss dashwood , at this point , turning her eyes on him with the most angry contempt , stopped him , by saying , “ it is hardly worth while , mr. willoughby , for you to relate , or for me to listen any longer . such a beginning as this can not be followed by any thing . do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on the subject . ”
austen	sense	“ i insist on you hearing the whole of it , ” he replied , “ my fortune was never large , and i had always been expensive , always in the habit of associating with people of better income than myself . every year since my coming of age , or even before , i believe , had added to my debts ; and though the death of my old cousin , mrs. smith , was to set me free ; yet that event being uncertain , and possibly far distant , it had been for some time my intention to re-establish my circumstances by marrying a woman of fortune . to attach myself to your sister , therefore , was not a thing to be thought of ; and with a meanness , selfishness , cruelty , which no indignant , no contemptuous look , even of yours , miss dashwood , can ever reprobate too much , —i was acting in this manner , trying to engage her regard , without a thought of returning it . but one thing may be said for me : even in that horrid state of selfish vanity , i did not know the extent of the injury i meditated , because i did not _then_ know what it was to love . but have i ever known it ? well may it be doubted ; for , had i really loved , could i have sacrificed my feelings to vanity , to avarice ? or , what is more , could i have sacrificed hers ? but i have done it . to avoid a comparative poverty , which her affection and her society would have deprived of all its horrors , i have , by raising myself to affluence , lost every thing that could make it a blessing . ”
austen	sense	“ you did then , ” said elinor , a little softened , “ believe yourself at one time attached to her ? ” “ to have resisted such attractions , to have withstood such tenderness ! is there a man on earth who could have done it ? yes , i found myself , by insensible degrees , sincerely fond of her ; and the happiest hours of my life were what i spent with her when i felt my intentions were strictly honourable , and my feelings blameless . even _then_ , however , when fully determined on paying my addresses to her , i allowed myself most improperly to put off , from day to day , the moment of doing it , from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed . i will not reason here—nor will i stop for _you_ to expatiate on the absurdity , and the worse than absurdity , of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was already bound . the event has proved , that i was a cunning fool , providing with great circumspection for a possible opportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched for ever . at last , however , my resolution was taken , and i had determined , as soon as i could engage her alone , to justify the attentions i had so invariably paid her , and openly assure her of an affection which i had already taken such pains to display . but in the interim—in the interim of the very few hours that were to pass , before i could have an opportunity of speaking with her in private—a circumstance occurred—an unlucky circumstance , to ruin all my resolution , and with it all my comfort . a discovery took place , ” —here he hesitated and looked down . “ mrs . smith had somehow or other been informed , i imagine by some distant relation , whose interest it was to deprive me of her favour , of an affair , a connection—but i need not explain myself farther , ” he added , looking at her with an heightened colour and an enquiring eye , — “ your particular intimacy—you have probably heard the whole story long ago . ”
austen	sense	“ i have , ” returned elinor , colouring likewise , and hardening her heart anew against any compassion for him , “ i have heard it all . and how you will explain away any part of your guilt in that dreadful business , i confess is beyond my comprehension . ”
austen	sense	“ remember , ” cried willoughby , “ from whom you received the account . could it be an impartial one ? i acknowledge that her situation and her character ought to have been respected by me . i do not mean to justify myself , but at the same time can not leave you to suppose that i have nothing to urge—that because she was injured she was irreproachable , and because _i_ was a libertine , _she_ must be a saint . if the violence of her passions , the weakness of her understanding—i do not mean , however , to defend myself . her affection for me deserved better treatment , and i often , with great self-reproach , recall the tenderness which , for a very short time , had the power of creating any return . i wish—i heartily wish it had never been . but i have injured more than herself ; and i have injured one , whose affection for me ( may i say it ? ) was scarcely less warm than hers ; and whose mind—oh ! how infinitely superior ! ”
austen	sense	“ your indifference , however , towards that unfortunate girl—i must say it , unpleasant to me as the discussion of such a subject may well be—your indifference is no apology for your cruel neglect of her . do not think yourself excused by any weakness , any natural defect of understanding on her side , in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours . you must have known , that while you were enjoying yourself in devonshire pursuing fresh schemes , always gay , always happy , she was reduced to the extremest indigence . ”
austen	sense	“ but , upon my soul , i did _not_ know it , ” he warmly replied ; “ i did not recollect that i had omitted to give her my direction ; and common sense might have told her how to find it out . ”
austen	sense	“ well , sir , and what said mrs. smith ? ” “ she taxed me with the offence at once , and my confusion may be guessed . the purity of her life , the formality of her notions , her ignorance of the world—every thing was against me . the matter itself i could not deny , and vain was every endeavour to soften it . she was previously disposed , i believe , to doubt the morality of my conduct in general , and was moreover discontented with the very little attention , the very little portion of my time that i had bestowed on her , in my present visit . in short , it ended in a total breach . by one measure i might have saved myself . in the height of her morality , good woman ! she offered to forgive the past , if i would marry eliza . that could not be—and i was formally dismissed from her favour and her house . the night following this affair—i was to go the next morning—was spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be . the struggle was great—but it ended too soon . my affection for marianne , my thorough conviction of her attachment to me—it was all insufficient to outweigh that dread of poverty , or get the better of those false ideas of the necessity of riches , which i was naturally inclined to feel , and expensive society had increased . i had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife , if i chose to address her , and i persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do . a heavy scene however awaited me , before i could leave devonshire ; —i was engaged to dine with you on that very day ; some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement . but whether i should write this apology , or deliver it in person , was a point of long debate . to see marianne , i felt , would be dreadful , and i even doubted whether i could see her again , and keep to my resolution . in that point , however , i undervalued my own magnanimity , as the event declared ; for i went , i saw her , and saw her miserable , and left her miserable—and left her hoping never to see her again . ”
austen	sense	“ why did you call , mr. willoughby ? ” said elinor , reproachfully ; “ a note would have answered every purpose . why was it necessary to call ? ” “ it was necessary to my own pride . i could not bear to leave the country in a manner that might lead you , or the rest of the neighbourhood , to suspect any part of what had really passed between mrs. smith and myself—and i resolved therefore on calling at the cottage , in my way to honiton . the sight of your dear sister , however , was really dreadful ; and , to heighten the matter , i found her alone . you were all gone i do not know where . i had left her only the evening before , so fully , so firmly resolved within my self on doing right ! a few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever ; and i remember how happy , how gay were my spirits , as i walked from the cottage to allenham , satisfied with myself , delighted with every body ! but in this , our last interview of friendship , i approached her with a sense of guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembling . her sorrow , her disappointment , her deep regret , when i told her that i was obliged to leave devonshire so immediately—i never shall forget it—united too with such reliance , such confidence in me ! —oh , god ! —what a hard-hearted rascal i was ! ”
austen	sense	they were both silent for a few moments . elinor first spoke . “ did you tell her that you should soon return ? ” “ i do not know what i told her , ” he replied , impatiently ; “ less than was due to the past , beyond a doubt , and in all likelihood much more than was justified by the future . i can not think of it.—it won ’ t do.—then came your dear mother to torture me farther , with all her kindness and confidence . thank heaven ! it _did_ torture me . i was miserable . miss dashwood , you can not have an idea of the comfort it gives me to look back on my own misery . i owe such a grudge to myself for the stupid , rascally folly of my own heart , that all my past sufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now . well , i went , left all that i loved , and went to those to whom , at best , i was only indifferent . my journey to town—travelling with my own horses , and therefore so tediously—no creature to speak to—my own reflections so cheerful—when i looked forward every thing so inviting ! —when i looked back at barton , the picture so soothing ! —oh , it was a blessed journey ! ”
austen	sense	he stopped . “ well , sir , ” said elinor , who , though pitying him , grew impatient for his departure , “ and this is all ? ” “ all ! —no : —have you forgot what passed in town ? that infamous letter ? did she show it you ? ”
austen	sense	“ yes , i saw every note that passed. ” “ when the first of hers reached me ( as it immediately did , for i was in town the whole time , ) what i felt is—in the common phrase , not to be expressed ; in a more simple one—perhaps too simple to raise any emotion—my feelings were very , very painful.—every line , every word was—in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer , were she here , would forbid—a dagger to my heart . to know that marianne was in town was—in the same language—a thunderbolt.—thunderbolts and daggers ! —what a reproof would she have given me ! —her taste , her opinions—i believe they are better known to me than my own , —and i am sure they are dearer . ”
austen	sense	elinor ’ s heart , which had undergone many changes in the course of this extraordinary conversation , was now softened again ; —yet she felt it her duty to check such ideas in her companion as the last .
austen	sense	“ this is not right , mr. willoughby.—remember that you are married . relate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me to hear. ” “ marianne ’ s note , by assuring me that i was still as dear to her as in former days , —that in spite of the many , many weeks we had been separated , she was as constant in her own feelings , and as full of faith in the constancy of mine as ever , —awakened all my remorse . i say awakened , because time and london , business and dissipation , had in some measure quieted it , and i had been growing a fine hardened villain , fancying myself indifferent to her , and chusing to fancy that she too must have become indifferent to me ; talking to myself of our past attachment as a mere idle , trifling business , shrugging up my shoulders in proof of its being so , and silencing every reproach , overcoming every scruple , by secretly saying now and then , ‘ i shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married. ’ but this note made me know myself better . i felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman in the world , and that i was using her infamously . but every thing was then just settled between miss grey and me . to retreat was impossible . all that i had to do , was to avoid you both . i sent no answer to marianne , intending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice ; and for some time i was even determined not to call in berkeley street ; —but at last , judging it wiser to affect the air of a cool , common acquaintance than anything else , i watched you all safely out of the house one morning , and left my name . ”
austen	sense	“ watched us out of the house ! ” “ even so . you would be surprised to hear how often i watched you , how often i was on the point of falling in with you . i have entered many a shop to avoid your sight , as the carriage drove by . lodging as i did in bond street , there was hardly a day in which i did not catch a glimpse of one or other of you ; and nothing but the most constant watchfulness on my side , a most invariably prevailing desire to keep out of your sight , could have separated us so long . i avoided the middletons as much as possible , as well as everybody else who was likely to prove an acquaintance in common . not aware of their being in town , however , i blundered on sir john , i believe , the first day of his coming , and the day after i had called at mrs. jennings ’ s . he asked me to a party , a dance at his house in the evening . had he _not_ told me as an inducement that you and your sister were to be there , i should have felt it too certain a thing , to trust myself near him . the next morning brought another short note from marianne—still affectionate , open , artless , confiding—everything that could make _my_ conduct most hateful . i could not answer it . i tried—but could not frame a sentence . but i thought of her , i believe , every moment of the day . if you _can_ pity me , miss dashwood , pity my situation as it was _then_ . with my head and heart full of your sister , i was forced to play the happy lover to another woman ! those three or four weeks were worse than all . well , at last , as i need not tell you , you were forced on me ; and what a sweet figure i cut ! what an evening of agony it was ! marianne , beautiful as an angel on one side , calling me willoughby in such a tone ! oh , god ! holding out her hand to me , asking me for an explanation , with those bewitching eyes fixed in such speaking solicitude on my face ! and sophia , jealous as the devil on the other hand , looking all that was—well , it does not signify ; it is over now . such an evening ! i ran away from you all as soon as i could ; but not before i had seen marianne ’ s sweet face as white as death . _that_ was the last , last look i ever had of her ; the last manner in which she appeared to me . it was a horrid sight ! yet when i thought of her to-day as really dying , it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that i knew exactly how she would appear to those , who saw her last in this world . she was before me , constantly before me , as i travelled , in the same look and hue . ”
austen	sense	a short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded . willoughby first rousing himself , broke it thus : “ well , let me make haste and be gone . your sister is certainly better , certainly out of danger ? ”
austen	sense	“ we are assured of it. ” “ your poor mother , too ! —doting on marianne. ” “ but the letter , mr. willoughby , your own letter ; have you any thing to say about that ? ” “ yes , yes , _that_ in particular . your sister wrote to me again , you know , the very next morning . you saw what she said . i was breakfasting at the ellisons , —and her letter , with some others , was brought to me there from my lodgings . it happened to catch sophia ’ s eye before it caught mine—and its size , the elegance of the paper , the hand-writing altogether , immediately gave her a suspicion . some vague report had reached her before of my attachment to some young lady in devonshire , and what had passed within her observation the preceding evening had marked who the young lady was , and made her more jealous than ever . affecting that air of playfulness , therefore , which is delightful in a woman one loves , she opened the letter directly , and read its contents . she was well paid for her impudence . she read what made her wretched . her wretchedness i could have borne , but her passion—her malice—at all events it must be appeased . and , in short—what do you think of my wife ’ s style of letter-writing ? —delicate—tender—truly feminine—was it not ? ”
austen	sense	“ your wife ! —the letter was in your own hand-writing. ” “ yes , but i had only the credit of servilely copying such sentences as i was ashamed to put my name to . the original was all her own—her own happy thoughts and gentle diction . but what could i do ! —we were engaged , every thing in preparation , the day almost fixed—but i am talking like a fool . preparation ! day ! in honest words , her money was necessary to me , and in a situation like mine , any thing was to be done to prevent a rupture . and after all , what did it signify to my character in the opinion of marianne and her friends , in what language my answer was couched ? it must have been only to one end . my business was to declare myself a scoundrel , and whether i did it with a bow or a bluster was of little importance . ‘ i am ruined for ever in their opinion , ’ said i to myself : ‘ i am shut out for ever from their society , they already think me an unprincipled fellow , this letter will only make them think me a blackguard one. ’ such were my reasonings , as , in a sort of desperate carelessness , i copied my wife ’ s words , and parted with the last relics of marianne . her three notes , —unluckily they were all in my pocketbook , or i should have denied their existence , and hoarded them for ever , —i was forced to put them up , and could not even kiss them . and the lock of hair—that too i had always carried about me in the same pocket-book , which was now searched by madam with the most ingratiating virulence , —the dear lock , —all , every memento was torn from me . ”
austen	sense	“ you are very wrong , mr. willoughby , very blamable , ” said elinor , while her voice , in spite of herself , betrayed her compassionate emotion ; “ you ought not to speak in this way , either of mrs. willoughby or my sister . you had made your own choice . it was not forced on you . your wife has a claim to your politeness , to your respect , at least . she must be attached to you , or she would not have married you . to treat her with unkindness , to speak of her slightingly is no atonement to marianne—nor can i suppose it a relief to your own conscience . ”
austen	sense	“ do not talk to me of my wife , ” said he with a heavy sigh ; “ she does not deserve your compassion . she knew i had no regard for her when we married . well , married we were , and came down to combe magna to be happy , and afterwards returned to town to be gay . and now do you pity me , miss dashwood ? or have i said all this to no purpose ? am i , —be it only one degree , —am i less guilty in your opinion than i was before ? my intentions were not always wrong . have i explained away any part of my guilt ? ”
austen	sense	“ yes , you have certainly removed something—a little . you have proved yourself , on the whole , less faulty than i had believed you . you have proved your heart less wicked , much less wicked . but i hardly know—the misery that you have inflicted—i hardly know what could have made it worse . ”
austen	sense	“ will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered , what i have been telling you ? —let me be a little lightened too in her opinion as well as in yours . you tell me that she has forgiven me already . let me be able to fancy that a better knowledge of my heart , and of my present feelings , will draw from her a more spontaneous , more natural , more gentle , less dignified , forgiveness . tell her of my misery and my penitence—tell her that my heart was never inconstant to her , and if you will , that at this moment she is dearer to me than ever . ”
austen	sense	“ i will tell her all that is necessary to what may comparatively be called , your justification . but you have not explained to me the particular reason of your coming now , nor how you heard of her illness . ”
austen	sense	“ last night , in drury lane lobby , i ran against sir john middleton , and when he saw who i was , for the first time these two months , he spoke to me . that he had cut me ever since my marriage , i had seen without surprise or resentment . now , however , his good-natured , honest , stupid soul , full of indignation against me , and concern for your sister , could not resist the temptation of telling me what he knew ought to , though probably he did not think it _would_ , vex me horridly . as bluntly as he could speak it , therefore , he told me that marianne dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at cleveland—a letter that morning received from mrs. jennings declared her danger most imminent—the palmers are all gone off in a fright , & c. i was too much shocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the undiscerning sir john . his heart was softened in seeing mine suffer ; and so much of his ill-will was done away , that when we parted , he almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise about a pointer puppy . what i felt on hearing that your sister was dying , and dying too , believing me the greatest villain upon earth , scorning , hating me in her latest moments—for how could i tell what horrid projects might not have been imputed ? _one_ person i was sure would represent me as capable of anything—what i felt was dreadful ! my resolution was soon made , and at eight o ’ clock this morning i was in my carriage . now you know all . ”
austen	sense	elinor made no answer . her thoughts were silently fixed on the irreparable injury which too early an independence and its consequent habits of idleness , dissipation , and luxury , had made in the mind , the character , the happiness , of a man who , to every advantage of person and talents , united a disposition naturally open and honest , and a feeling , affectionate temper . the world had made him extravagant and vain—extravagance and vanity had made him cold-hearted and selfish . vanity , while seeking its own guilty triumph at the expense of another , had involved him in a real attachment , which extravagance , or at least its offspring , necessity , had required to be sacrificed . each faulty propensity in leading him to evil , had led him likewise to punishment . the attachment , from which against honour , against feeling , against every better interest he had outwardly torn himself , now , when no longer allowable , governed every thought ; and the connection , for the sake of which he had , with little scruple , left her sister to misery , was likely to prove a source of unhappiness to himself of a far more incurable nature . from a reverie of this kind she was recalled at the end of some minutes by willoughby , who , rousing himself from a reverie at least equally painful , started up in preparation for going , and said—
austen	sense	“ there is no use in staying here ; i must be off. ” “ are you going back to town ? ” “ no—to combe magna . i have business there ; from thence to town in a day or two . good bye . ”
austen	sense	he held out his hand . she could not refuse to give him hers ; —he pressed it with affection . “ and you _do_ think something better of me than you did ? ” said he , letting it fall , and leaning against the mantel-piece as if forgetting he was to go .
austen	sense	elinor assured him that she did ; —that she forgave , pitied , wished him well—was even interested in his happiness—and added some gentle counsel as to the behaviour most likely to promote it . his answer was not very encouraging .
austen	sense	“ as to that , ” said he , “ i must rub through the world as well as i can . domestic happiness is out of the question . if , however , i am allowed to think that you and yours feel an interest in my fate and actions , it may be the means—it may put me on my guard—at least , it may be something to live for . marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever . were i even by any blessed chance at liberty again— ”
austen	sense	elinor stopped him with a reproof . “ well , ” —he replied— “ once more good bye . i shall now go away and live in dread of one event. ” “ what do you mean ? ” “ your sister ’ s marriage . ”
austen	sense	“ you are very wrong . she can never be more lost to you than she is now. ” “ but she will be gained by some one else . and if that some one should be the very he whom , of all others , i could least bear—but i will not stay to rob myself of all your compassionate goodwill , by showing that where i have most injured i can least forgive . good bye , —god bless you ! ”
austen	sense	and with these words , he almost ran out of the room . chapter xlv . elinor , for some time after he left her , for some time even after the sound of his carriage had died away , remained too much oppressed by a crowd of ideas , widely differing in themselves , but of which sadness was the general result , to think even of her sister .
austen	sense	willoughby , he , whom only half an hour ago she had abhorred as the most worthless of men , willoughby , in spite of all his faults , excited a degree of commiseration for the sufferings produced by them , which made her think of him as now separated for ever from her family , with a tenderness , a regret , rather in proportion , as she soon acknowledged within herself—to his wishes than to his merits . she felt that his influence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason to have weight ; by that person of uncommon attraction , that open , affectionate , and lively manner which it was no merit to possess ; and by that still ardent love for marianne , which it was not even innocent to indulge . but she felt that it was so , long , long before she could feel his influence less .
austen	sense	when at last she returned to the unconscious marianne , she found her just awaking , refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of her hopes . elinor ’ s heart was full . the past , the present , the future , willoughby ’ s visit , marianne ’ s safety , and her mother ’ s expected arrival , threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits which kept off every indication of fatigue , and made her only fearful of betraying herself to her sister . short was the time , however , in which that fear could affect her , for within half an hour after willoughby ’ s leaving the house , she was again called down stairs by the sound of another carriage.—eager to save her mother from every unnecessary moment ’ s horrible suspense , she ran immediately into the hall , and reached the outward door just in time to receive and support her as she entered it .
austen	sense	mrs. dashwood , whose terror as they drew near the house had produced almost the conviction of marianne ’ s being no more , had no voice to inquire after her , no voice even for elinor ; but _she_ , waiting neither for salutation nor inquiry , instantly gave the joyful relief ; and her mother , catching it with all her usual warmth , was in a moment as much overcome by her happiness , as she had been before by her fears . she was supported into the drawing-room between her daughter and her friend ; and there , shedding tears of joy , though still unable to speak , embraced elinor again and again , turning from her at intervals to press colonel brandon ’ s hand , with a look which spoke at once her gratitude , and her conviction of his sharing with herself in the bliss of the moment . he shared it , however , in a silence even greater than her own .
austen	sense	as soon as mrs. dashwood had recovered herself , to see marianne was her first desire ; and in two minutes she was with her beloved child , rendered dearer to her than ever by absence , unhappiness , and danger . elinor ’ s delight , as she saw what each felt in the meeting , was only checked by an apprehension of its robbing marianne of farther sleep : but mrs. dashwood could be calm , could be even prudent , when the life of a child was at stake , and marianne , satisfied in knowing her mother was near her , and conscious of being too weak for conversation , submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by every nurse around her . mrs. dashwood _would_ sit up with her all night ; and elinor , in compliance with her mother ’ s entreaty , went to bed . but the rest , which one night entirely sleepless , and many hours of the most wearing anxiety seemed to make requisite , was kept off by irritation of spirits . willoughby , “ poor willoughby , ” as she now allowed herself to call him , was constantly in her thoughts ; she would not but have heard his vindication for the world , and now blamed , now acquitted herself for having judged him so harshly before . but her promise of relating it to her sister was invariably painful . she dreaded the performance of it , dreaded what its effect on marianne might be ; doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever be happy with another ; and for a moment wished willoughby a widower . then , remembering colonel brandon , reproved herself , felt that to _his_ sufferings and _his_ constancy far more than to his rival ’ s , the reward of her sister was due , and wished any thing rather than mrs. willoughby ’ s death .
austen	sense	the shock of colonel brandon ’ s errand at barton had been much softened to mrs. dashwood by her own previous alarm ; for so great was her uneasiness about marianne , that she had already determined to set out for cleveland on that very day , without waiting for any further intelligence , and had so far settled her journey before his arrival , that the careys were then expected every moment to fetch margaret away , as her mother was unwilling to take her where there might be infection .
austen	sense	marianne continued to mend every day , and the brilliant cheerfulness of mrs. dashwood ’ s looks and spirits proved her to be , as she repeatedly declared herself , one of the happiest women in the world . elinor could not hear the declaration , nor witness its proofs without sometimes wondering whether her mother ever recollected edward . but mrs. dashwood , trusting to the temperate account of her own disappointment which elinor had sent her , was led away by the exuberance of her joy to think only of what would increase it . marianne was restored to her from a danger in which , as she now began to feel , her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate attachment to willoughby , had contributed to place her ; —and in her recovery she had yet another source of joy unthought of by elinor . it was thus imparted to her , as soon as any opportunity of private conference between them occurred .
austen	sense	“ at last we are alone . my elinor , you do not yet know all my happiness . colonel brandon loves marianne . he has told me so himself. ” her daughter , feeling by turns both pleased and pained , surprised and not surprised , was all silent attention .
austen	sense	“ you are never like me , dear elinor , or i should wonder at your composure now . had i sat down to wish for any possible good to my family , i should have fixed on colonel brandon ’ s marrying one of you as the object most desirable . and i believe marianne will be the most happy with him of the two . ”
austen	sense	elinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so , because satisfied that none founded on an impartial consideration of their age , characters , or feelings , could be given ; —but her mother must always be carried away by her imagination on any interesting subject , and therefore instead of an inquiry , she passed it off with a smile .
austen	sense	“ he opened his whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled . it came out quite unawares , quite undesignedly . i , you may well believe , could talk of nothing but my child ; —he could not conceal his distress ; i saw that it equalled my own , and he perhaps , thinking that mere friendship , as the world now goes , would not justify so warm a sympathy—or rather , not thinking at all , i suppose—giving way to irresistible feelings , made me acquainted with his earnest , tender , constant , affection for marianne . he has loved her , my elinor , ever since the first moment of seeing her . ”
austen	sense	here , however , elinor perceived , —not the language , not the professions of colonel brandon , but the natural embellishments of her mother ’ s active fancy , which fashioned every thing delightful to her as it chose .
austen	sense	“ his regard for her , infinitely surpassing anything that willoughby ever felt or feigned , as much more warm , as more sincere or constant—which ever we are to call it—has subsisted through all the knowledge of dear marianne ’ s unhappy prepossession for that worthless young man ! —and without selfishness—without encouraging a hope ! —could he have seen her happy with another—such a noble mind ! —such openness , such sincerity ! —no one can be deceived in _him_ . ”
austen	sense	“ colonel brandon ’ s character , ” said elinor , “ as an excellent man , is well established. ” “ i know it is , ” —replied her mother seriously , “ or after such a warning , _i_ should be the last to encourage such affection , or even to be pleased by it . but his coming for me as he did , with such active , such ready friendship , is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men . ”
austen	sense	“ his character , however , ” answered elinor , “ does not rest on _one_ act of kindness , to which his affection for marianne , were humanity out of the case , would have prompted him . to mrs. jennings , to the middletons , he has been long and intimately known ; they equally love and respect him ; and even my own knowledge of him , though lately acquired , is very considerable ; and so highly do _i_ value and esteem him , that if marianne can be happy with him , i shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world . what answer did you give him ? —did you allow him to hope ? ”
austen	sense	“ oh ! my love , i could not then talk of hope to him or to myself . marianne might at that moment be dying . but he did not ask for hope or encouragement . his was an involuntary confidence , an irrepressible effusion to a soothing friend , not an application to a parent . yet after a time i _did_ say , for at first i was quite overcome , that if she lived , as i trusted she might , my greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage ; and since our arrival , since our delightful security , i have repeated it to him more fully , have given him every encouragement in my power . time , a very little time , i tell him , will do everything ; marianne ’ s heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a man as willoughby . his own merits must soon secure it . ”
austen	sense	“ to judge from the colonel ’ s spirits , however , you have not yet made him equally sanguine. ” “ no . he thinks marianne ’ s affection too deeply rooted for any change in it under a great length of time , and even supposing her heart again free , is too diffident of himself to believe , that with such a difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her . there , however , he is quite mistaken . his age is only so much beyond hers as to be an advantage , as to make his character and principles fixed ; and his disposition , i am well convinced , is exactly the very one to make your sister happy . and his person , his manners too , are all in his favour . my partiality does not blind me ; he certainly is not so handsome as willoughby ; but at the same time , there is something much more pleasing in his countenance . there was always a something , if you remember , in willoughby ’ s eyes at times , which i did not like . ”
austen	sense	elinor could _not_ remember it ; but her mother , without waiting for her assent , continued , “ and his manners , the colonel ’ s manners are not only more pleasing to me than willoughby ’ s ever were , but they are of a kind i well know to be more solidly attaching to marianne . their gentleness , their genuine attention to other people , and their manly unstudied simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition , than the liveliness , often artificial , and often ill-timed of the other . i am very sure myself , that had willoughby turned out as really amiable , as he has proved himself the contrary , marianne would yet never have been so happy with _him_ as she will be with colonel brandon . ”
austen	sense	she paused.—her daughter could not quite agree with her , but her dissent was not heard , and therefore gave no offence . “ at delaford , she will be within an easy distance of me , ” added mrs. dashwood , “ even if i remain at barton ; and in all probability , —for i hear it is a large village , —indeed there certainly _must_ be some small house or cottage close by , that would suit us quite as well as our present situation . ”
austen	sense	poor elinor ! —here was a new scheme for getting her to delaford ! —but her spirit was stubborn . “ his fortune too ! —for at my time of life you know , everybody cares about _that ; _—and though i neither know nor desire to know , what it really is , i am sure it must be a good one . ”
austen	sense	here they were interrupted by the entrance of a third person , and elinor withdrew to think it all over in private , to wish success to her friend , and yet in wishing it , to feel a pang for willoughby .
austen	sense	chapter xlvi . marianne ’ s illness , though weakening in its kind , had not been long enough to make her recovery slow ; and with youth , natural strength , and her mother ’ s presence in aid , it proceeded so smoothly as to enable her to remove , within four days after the arrival of the latter , into mrs. palmer ’ s dressing-room . when there , at her own particular request , for she was impatient to pour forth her thanks to him for fetching her mother , colonel brandon was invited to visit her .
austen	sense	his emotion on entering the room , in seeing her altered looks , and in receiving the pale hand which she immediately held out to him , was such , as , in elinor ’ s conjecture , must arise from something more than his affection for marianne , or the consciousness of its being known to others ; and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying complexion as he looked at her sister , the probable recurrence of many past scenes of misery to his mind , brought back by that resemblance between marianne and eliza already acknowledged , and now strengthened by the hollow eye , the sickly skin , the posture of reclining weakness , and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation .
austen	sense	mrs. dashwood , not less watchful of what passed than her daughter , but with a mind very differently influenced , and therefore watching to very different effect , saw nothing in the colonel ’ s behaviour but what arose from the most simple and self-evident sensations , while in the actions and words of marianne she persuaded herself to think that something more than gratitude already dawned .
austen	sense	at the end of another day or two , marianne growing visibly stronger every twelve hours , mrs. dashwood , urged equally by her own and her daughter ’ s wishes , began to talk of removing to barton . on _her_ measures depended those of her two friends ; mrs. jennings could not quit cleveland during the dashwoods ’ stay ; and colonel brandon was soon brought , by their united request , to consider his own abode there as equally determinate , if not equally indispensable . at his and mrs. jennings ’ s united request in return , mrs. dashwood was prevailed on to accept the use of his carriage on her journey back , for the better accommodation of her sick child ; and the colonel , at the joint invitation of mrs. dashwood and mrs. jennings , whose active good-nature made her friendly and hospitable for other people as well as herself , engaged with pleasure to redeem it by a visit at the cottage , in the course of a few weeks .
austen	sense	the day of separation and departure arrived ; and marianne , after taking so particular and lengthened a leave of mrs. jennings , one so earnestly grateful , so full of respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her own heart from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention , and bidding colonel brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend , was carefully assisted by him into the carriage , of which he seemed anxious that she should engross at least half . mrs. dashwood and elinor then followed , and the others were left by themselves , to talk of the travellers , and feel their own dullness , till mrs. jennings was summoned to her chaise to take comfort in the gossip of her maid for the loss of her two young companions ; and colonel brandon immediately afterwards took his solitary way to delaford .
austen	sense	the dashwoods were two days on the road , and marianne bore her journey on both , without essential fatigue . every thing that the most zealous affection , the most solicitous care could do to render her comfortable , was the office of each watchful companion , and each found their reward in her bodily ease , and her calmness of spirits . to elinor , the observation of the latter was particularly grateful . she , who had seen her week after week so constantly suffering , oppressed by anguish of heart which she had neither courage to speak of , nor fortitude to conceal , now saw with a joy , which no other could equally share , an apparent composure of mind , which , in being the result as she trusted of serious reflection , must eventually lead her to contentment and cheerfulness .
austen	sense	as they approached barton , indeed , and entered on scenes of which every field and every tree brought some peculiar , some painful recollection , she grew silent and thoughtful , and turning away her face from their notice , sat earnestly gazing through the window . but here , elinor could neither wonder nor blame ; and when she saw , as she assisted marianne from the carriage , that she had been crying , she saw only an emotion too natural in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity , and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise . in the whole of her subsequent manner , she traced the direction of a mind awakened to reasonable exertion ; for no sooner had they entered their common sitting-room , than marianne turned her eyes around it with a look of resolute firmness , as if determined at once to accustom herself to the sight of every object with which the remembrance of willoughby could be connected.—she said little , but every sentence aimed at cheerfulness , and though a sigh sometimes escaped her , it never passed away without the atonement of a smile . after dinner she would try her piano-forte . she went to it ; but the music on which her eye first rested was an opera , procured for her by willoughby , containing some of their favourite duets , and bearing on its outward leaf her own name in his hand-writing.—that would not do.—she shook her head , put the music aside , and after running over the keys for a minute , complained of feebleness in her fingers , and closed the instrument again ; declaring however with firmness as she did so , that she should in future practice much .
austen	sense	the next morning produced no abatement in these happy symptoms . on the contrary , with a mind and body alike strengthened by rest , she looked and spoke with more genuine spirit , anticipating the pleasure of margaret ’ s return , and talking of the dear family party which would then be restored , of their mutual pursuits and cheerful society , as the only happiness worth a wish .
austen	sense	“ when the weather is settled , and i have recovered my strength , ” said she , “ we will take long walks together every day . we will walk to the farm at the edge of the down , and see how the children go on ; we will walk to sir john ’ s new plantations at barton cross , and the abbeyland ; and we will often go to the old ruins of the priory , and try to trace its foundations as far as we are told they once reached . i know we shall be happy . i know the summer will pass happily away . i mean never to be later in rising than six , and from that time till dinner i shall divide every moment between music and reading . i have formed my plan , and am determined to enter on a course of serious study . our own library is too well known to me , to be resorted to for any thing beyond mere amusement . but there are many works well worth reading at the park ; and there are others of more modern production which i know i can borrow of colonel brandon . by reading only six hours a-day , i shall gain in the course of a twelve-month a great deal of instruction which i now feel myself to want . ”
austen	sense	elinor honoured her for a plan which originated so nobly as this ; though smiling to see the same eager fancy which had been leading her to the extreme of languid indolence and selfish repining , now at work in introducing excess into a scheme of such rational employment and virtuous self-control . her smile however changed to a sigh when she remembered that promise to willoughby was yet unfulfilled , and feared she had that to communicate which might again unsettle the mind of marianne , and ruin at least for a time this fair prospect of busy tranquillity . willing therefore to delay the evil hour , she resolved to wait till her sister ’ s health were more secure , before she appointed it . but the resolution was made only to be broken .
austen	sense	marianne had been two or three days at home , before the weather was fine enough for an invalid like herself to venture out . but at last a soft , genial morning appeared ; such as might tempt the daughter ’ s wishes and the mother ’ s confidence ; and marianne , leaning on elinor ’ s arm , was authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue , in the lane before the house .
austen	sense	the sisters set out at a pace , slow as the feebleness of marianne in an exercise hitherto untried since her illness required ; and they had advanced only so far beyond the house as to admit a full view of the hill , the important hill behind , when pausing with her eyes turned towards it , marianne calmly said , —
austen	sense	“ there , exactly there , ” —pointing with one hand , “ on that projecting mound , —there i fell ; and there i first saw willoughby. ” her voice sunk with the word , but presently reviving she added , “ i am thankful to find that i can look with so little pain on the spot ! shall we ever talk on that subject , elinor ? ” hesitatingly it was said . “ or will it be wrong ? i _can_ talk of it now , i hope , as i ought to do . ”
austen	sense	elinor tenderly invited her to be open . “ as for regret , ” said marianne , “ i have done with that , as far as _he_ is concerned . i do not mean to talk to you of what my feelings have been for him , but what they are _now_ . at present , if i could be satisfied on one point , if i could be allowed to think that he was not _always_ acting a part , not _always_ deceiving me ; but above all , if i could be assured that he never was so _very_ wicked as my fears have sometimes fancied him , since the story of that unfortunate girl— ”
austen	sense	she stopt . elinor joyfully treasured her words as she answered , “ if you could be assured of that , you think you should be easy. ” “ yes . my peace of mind is doubly involved in it ; for not only is it horrible to suspect a person , who has been what _he_ has been to _me_ , of such designs , but what must it make me appear to myself ? what in a situation like mine , but a most shamefully unguarded affection could expose me to— ”
austen	sense	“ how then , ” asked her sister , “ would you account for his behaviour ? ” “ i would suppose him , —oh , how gladly would i suppose him , only fickle , very , very fickle. ” elinor said no more . she was debating within herself on the eligibility of beginning her story directly , or postponing it till marianne were in stronger health ; —and they crept on for a few minutes in silence .
austen	sense	“ i am not wishing him too much good , ” said marianne at last with a sigh , “ when i wish his secret reflections may be no more unpleasant than my own . he will suffer enough in them . ”
austen	sense	“ do you compare your conduct with his ? ” “ no . i compare it with what it ought to have been ; i compare it with yours. ” “ our situations have borne little resemblance. ” “ they have borne more than our conduct . do not , my dearest elinor , let your kindness defend what i know your judgment must censure . my illness has made me think . it has given me leisure and calmness for serious recollection . long before i was enough recovered to talk , i was perfectly able to reflect . i considered the past : i saw in my own behaviour , since the beginning of our acquaintance with him last autumn , nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself , and want of kindness to others . i saw that my own feelings had prepared my sufferings , and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me to the grave . my illness , i well knew , had been entirely brought on by myself by such negligence of my own health , as i had felt even at the time to be wrong . had i died , it would have been self-destruction . i did not know my danger till the danger was removed ; but with such feelings as these reflections gave me , i wonder at my recovery , —wonder that the very eagerness of my desire to live , to have time for atonement to my god , and to you all , did not kill me at once . had i died , in what peculiar misery should i have left you , my nurse , my friend , my sister ! you , who had seen all the fretful selfishness of my latter days ; who had known all the murmurings of my heart ! how should i have lived in _your_ remembrance ! my mother too ! how could you have consoled her ! i can not express my own abhorrence of myself . whenever i looked towards the past , i saw some duty neglected , or some failing indulged . every body seemed injured by me . the kindness , the unceasing kindness of mrs. jennings , i had repaid with ungrateful contempt . to the middletons , to the palmers , the steeles , to every common acquaintance even , i had been insolent and unjust ; with a heart hardened against their merits , and a temper irritated by their very attention . to john , to fanny , yes , even to them , little as they deserve , i had given less than their due . but you , you above all , above my mother , had been wronged by me . i , and only i , knew your heart and its sorrows ; yet to what did it influence me ? —not to any compassion that could benefit you or myself.—your example was before me ; but to what avail ? was i more considerate of you and your comfort ? did i imitate your forbearance , or lessen your restraints , by taking any part in those offices of general complaisance or particular gratitude which you had hitherto been left to discharge alone ? no ; not less when i knew you to be unhappy , than when i had believed you at ease , did i turn away from every exertion of duty or friendship ; scarcely allowing sorrow to exist but with me , regretting only _that_ heart which had deserted and wronged me , and leaving you , for whom i professed an unbounded affection , to be miserable for my sake . ”
austen	sense	here ceased the rapid flow of her self-reproving spirit ; and elinor , impatient to soothe , though too honest to flatter , gave her instantly that praise and support which her frankness and her contrition so well deserved . marianne pressed her hand and replied , —
austen	sense	“ you are very good.—the future must be my proof . i have laid down my plan , and if i am capable of adhering to it—my feelings shall be governed and my temper improved . they shall no longer worry others , nor torture myself . i shall now live solely for my family . you , my mother , and margaret , must henceforth be all the world to me ; you will share my affections entirely between you . from you , from my home , i shall never again have the smallest incitement to move ; and if i do mix in other society , it will be only to show that my spirit is humbled , my heart amended , and that i can practise the civilities , the lesser duties of life , with gentleness and forbearance . as for willoughby—to say that i shall soon or that i shall ever forget him , would be idle . his remembrance can be overcome by no change of circumstances or opinions . but it shall be regulated , it shall be checked by religion , by reason , by constant employment . ”
austen	sense	she paused—and added in a low voice , “ if i could but know _his_ heart , everything would become easy. ” elinor , who had now been for some time reflecting on the propriety or impropriety of speedily hazarding her narration , without feeling at all nearer decision than at first , heard this ; and perceiving that as reflection did nothing , resolution must do all , soon found herself leading to the fact .
austen	sense	she managed the recital , as she hoped , with address ; prepared her anxious listener with caution ; related simply and honestly the chief points on which willoughby grounded his apology ; did justice to his repentance , and softened only his protestations of present regard . marianne said not a word.—she trembled , her eyes were fixed on the ground , and her lips became whiter than even sickness had left them . a thousand inquiries sprung up from her heart , but she dared not urge one . she caught every syllable with panting eagerness ; her hand , unknowingly to herself , closely pressed her sister ’ s , and tears covered her cheeks .
austen	sense	elinor , dreading her being tired , led her towards home ; and till they reached the door of the cottage , easily conjecturing what her curiosity must be though no question was suffered to speak it , talked of nothing but willoughby , and their conversation together ; and was carefully minute in every particular of speech and look , where minuteness could be safely indulged . as soon as they entered the house , marianne with a kiss of gratitude and these two words just articulate through her tears , “ tell mama , ” withdrew from her sister and walked slowly up stairs . elinor would not attempt to disturb a solitude so reasonable as what she now sought ; and with a mind anxiously pre-arranging its result , and a resolution of reviving the subject again , should marianne fail to do it , she turned into the parlour to fulfill her parting injunction .
austen	sense	chapter xlvii . mrs. dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication of her former favourite . she rejoiced in his being cleared from some part of his imputed guilt ; —she was sorry for him ; —she wished him happy . but the feelings of the past could not be recalled.—nothing could restore him with a faith unbroken—a character unblemished , to marianne . nothing could do away the knowledge of what the latter had suffered through his means , nor remove the guilt of his conduct towards eliza . nothing could replace him , therefore , in her former esteem , nor injure the interests of colonel brandon .
austen	sense	had mrs. dashwood , like her daughter , heard willoughby ’ s story from himself—had she witnessed his distress , and been under the influence of his countenance and his manner , it is probable that her compassion would have been greater . but it was neither in elinor ’ s power , nor in her wish , to rouse such feelings in another , by her retailed explanation , as had at first been called forth in herself . reflection had given calmness to her judgment , and sobered her own opinion of willoughby ’ s deserts ; —she wished , therefore , to declare only the simple truth , and lay open such facts as were really due to his character , without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancy astray .
austen	sense	in the evening , when they were all three together , marianne began voluntarily to speak of him again ; —but that it was not without an effort , the restless , unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for some time previously sitting—her rising colour , as she spoke , —and her unsteady voice , plainly showed .
austen	sense	“ i wish to assure you both , ” said she , “ that i see every thing—as you can desire me to do. ” mrs. dashwood would have interrupted her instantly with soothing tenderness , had not elinor , who really wished to hear her sister ’ s unbiased opinion , by an eager sign , engaged her silence . marianne slowly continued , —
austen	sense	“ it is a great relief to me—what elinor told me this morning—i have now heard exactly what i wished to hear. ” —for some moments her voice was lost ; but recovering herself , she added , and with greater calmness than before— “ i am now perfectly satisfied , i wish for no change . i never could have been happy with him , after knowing , as sooner or later i must have known , all this.—i should have had no confidence , no esteem . nothing could have done it away to my feelings . ”
austen	sense	“ i know it—i know it , ” cried her mother . “ happy with a man of libertine practices ! —with one who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends , and the best of men ! —no—my marianne has not a heart to be made happy with such a man ! —her conscience , her sensitive conscience , would have felt all that the conscience of her husband ought to have felt . ”
austen	sense	marianne sighed , and repeated , “ i wish for no change. ” “ you consider the matter , ” said elinor , “ exactly as a good mind and a sound understanding must consider it ; and i dare say you perceive , as well as myself , not only in this , but in many other circumstances , reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you in many certain troubles and disappointments , in which you would have been poorly supported by an affection , on his side , much less certain . had you married , you must have been always poor . his expensiveness is acknowledged even by himself , and his whole conduct declares that self-denial is a word hardly understood by him . his demands and your inexperience together , on a small , very small income , must have brought on distresses which would not be the _less_ grievous to you , from having been entirely unknown and unthought of before . _your_ sense of honour and honesty would have led you , i know , when aware of your situation , to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible : and , perhaps , as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort , you might have been suffered to practice it , but beyond that—and how little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage ? beyond _that_ , had you endeavoured , however reasonably , to abridge _his_ enjoyments , is it not to be feared , that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it , you would have lessened your own influence on his heart , and made him regret the connection which had involved him in such difficulties ? ”
austen	sense	marianne ’ s lips quivered , and she repeated the word “ selfish ? ” in a tone that implied— “ do you really think him selfish ? ” “ the whole of his behaviour , ” replied elinor , “ from the beginning to the end of the affair , has been grounded on selfishness . it was selfishness which first made him sport with your affections ; which afterwards , when his own were engaged , made him delay the confession of it , and which finally carried him from barton . his own enjoyment , or his own ease , was , in every particular , his ruling principle . ”
austen	sense	“ it is very true . _my_ happiness never was his object. ” “ at present , ” continued elinor , “ he regrets what he has done . and why does he regret it ? —because he finds it has not answered towards himself . it has not made him happy . his circumstances are now unembarrassed—he suffers from no evil of that kind ; and he thinks only that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself . but does it follow that had he married you , he would have been happy ? —the inconveniences would have been different . he would then have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which , because they are removed , he now reckons as nothing . he would have had a wife of whose temper he could make no complaint , but he would have been always necessitous—always poor ; and probably would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance , even to domestic happiness , than the mere temper of a wife . ”
austen	sense	“ i have not a doubt of it , ” said marianne ; “ and i have nothing to regret—nothing but my own folly. ” “ rather say your mother ’ s imprudence , my child , ” said mrs. dashwood ; “ _she_ must be answerable . ”
austen	sense	marianne would not let her proceed ; —and elinor , satisfied that each felt their own error , wished to avoid any survey of the past that might weaken her sister ’ s spirits ; she , therefore , pursuing the first subject , immediately continued ,
austen	sense	“ _one_ observation may , i think , be fairly drawn from the whole of the story—that all willoughby ’ s difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue , in his behaviour to eliza williams . that crime has been the origin of every lesser one , and of all his present discontents . ”
austen	sense	marianne assented most feelingly to the remark ; and her mother was led by it to an enumeration of colonel brandon ’ s injuries and merits , warm as friendship and design could unitedly dictate . her daughter did not look , however , as if much of it were heard by her .
austen	sense	elinor , according to her expectation , saw on the two or three following days , that marianne did not continue to gain strength as she had done ; but while her resolution was unsubdued , and she still tried to appear cheerful and easy , her sister could safely trust to the effect of time upon her health .
austen	sense	margaret returned , and the family were again all restored to each other , again quietly settled at the cottage ; and if not pursuing their usual studies with quite so much vigour as when they first came to barton , at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future .
austen	sense	elinor grew impatient for some tidings of edward . she had heard nothing of him since her leaving london , nothing new of his plans , nothing certain even of his present abode . some letters had passed between her and her brother , in consequence of marianne ’ s illness ; and in the first of john ’ s , there had been this sentence : — “ we know nothing of our unfortunate edward , and can make no enquiries on so prohibited a subject , but conclude him to be still at oxford ; ” which was all the intelligence of edward afforded her by the correspondence , for his name was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters . she was not doomed , however , to be long in ignorance of his measures .
austen	sense	their man-servant had been sent one morning to exeter on business ; and when , as he waited at table , he had satisfied the inquiries of his mistress as to the event of his errand , this was his voluntary communication , —
austen	sense	“ i suppose you know , ma ’ am , that mr. ferrars is married. ” marianne gave a violent start , fixed her eyes upon elinor , saw her turning pale , and fell back in her chair in hysterics . mrs. dashwood , whose eyes , as she answered the servant ’ s inquiry , had intuitively taken the same direction , was shocked to perceive by elinor ’ s countenance how much she really suffered , and a moment afterwards , alike distressed by marianne ’ s situation , knew not on which child to bestow her principal attention .
austen	sense	the servant , who saw only that miss marianne was taken ill , had sense enough to call one of the maids , who , with mrs. dashwood ’ s assistance , supported her into the other room . by that time , marianne was rather better , and her mother leaving her to the care of margaret and the maid , returned to elinor , who , though still much disordered , had so far recovered the use of her reason and voice as to be just beginning an inquiry of thomas , as to the source of his intelligence . mrs. dashwood immediately took all that trouble on herself ; and elinor had the benefit of the information without the exertion of seeking it .
austen	sense	“ who told you that mr. ferrars was married , thomas ? ” “ i see mr. ferrars myself , ma ’ am , this morning in exeter , and his lady too , miss steele as was . they was stopping in a chaise at the door of the new london inn , as i went there with a message from sally at the park to her brother , who is one of the post-boys . i happened to look up as i went by the chaise , and so i see directly it was the youngest miss steele ; so i took off my hat , and she knew me and called to me , and inquired after you , ma ’ am , and the young ladies , especially miss marianne , and bid me i should give her compliments and mr. ferrars ’ s , their best compliments and service , and how sorry they was they had not time to come on and see you , but they was in a great hurry to go forwards , for they was going further down for a little while , but howsever , when they come back , they ’ d make sure to come and see you . ”
austen	sense	“ but did she tell you she was married , thomas ? ” “ yes , ma ’ am . she smiled , and said how she had changed her name since she was in these parts . she was always a very affable and free-spoken young lady , and very civil behaved . so , i made free to wish her joy . ”
austen	sense	“ was mr. ferrars in the carriage with her ? ” “ yes , ma ’ am , i just see him leaning back in it , but he did not look up ; —he never was a gentleman much for talking . ”
austen	sense	elinor ’ s heart could easily account for his not putting himself forward ; and mrs. dashwood probably found the same explanation . “ was there no one else in the carriage ? ” “ no , ma ’ am , only they two . ”
austen	sense	“ do you know where they came from ? ” “ they come straight from town , as miss lucy—mrs . ferrars told me. ” “ and are they going farther westward ? ” “ yes , ma ’ am—but not to bide long . they will soon be back again , and then they ’ d be sure and call here . ”
austen	sense	mrs. dashwood now looked at her daughter ; but elinor knew better than to expect them . she recognised the whole of lucy in the message , and was very confident that edward would never come near them . she observed in a low voice , to her mother , that they were probably going down to mr. pratt ’ s , near plymouth .
austen	sense	thomas ’ s intelligence seemed over . elinor looked as if she wished to hear more . “ did you see them off , before you came away ? ” “ no , ma ’ am—the horses were just coming out , but i could not bide any longer ; i was afraid of being late . ”
austen	sense	“ did mrs. ferrars look well ? ” “ yes , ma ’ am , she said how she was very well ; and to my mind she was always a very handsome young lady—and she seemed vastly contented . ”
austen	sense	mrs. dashwood could think of no other question , and thomas and the tablecloth , now alike needless , were soon afterwards dismissed . marianne had already sent to say , that she should eat nothing more . mrs. dashwood ’ s and elinor ’ s appetites were equally lost , and margaret might think herself very well off , that with so much uneasiness as both her sisters had lately experienced , so much reason as they had often had to be careless of their meals , she had never been obliged to go without her dinner before .
austen	sense	when the dessert and the wine were arranged , and mrs. dashwood and elinor were left by themselves , they remained long together in a similarity of thoughtfulness and silence . mrs. dashwood feared to hazard any remark , and ventured not to offer consolation . she now found that she had erred in relying on elinor ’ s representation of herself ; and justly concluded that every thing had been expressly softened at the time , to spare her from an increase of unhappiness , suffering as she then had suffered for marianne . she found that she had been misled by the careful , the considerate attention of her daughter , to think the attachment , which once she had so well understood , much slighter in reality , than she had been wont to believe , or than it was now proved to be . she feared that under this persuasion she had been unjust , inattentive , nay , almost unkind , to her elinor ; —that marianne ’ s affliction , because more acknowledged , more immediately before her , had too much engrossed her tenderness , and led her away to forget that in elinor she might have a daughter suffering almost as much , certainly with less self-provocation , and greater fortitude .
austen	sense	chapter xlviii . elinor now found the difference between the expectation of an unpleasant event , however certain the mind may be told to consider it , and certainty itself . she now found , that in spite of herself , she had always admitted a hope , while edward remained single , that something would occur to prevent his marrying lucy ; that some resolution of his own , some mediation of friends , or some more eligible opportunity of establishment for the lady , would arise to assist the happiness of all . but he was now married ; and she condemned her heart for the lurking flattery , which so much heightened the pain of the intelligence .
austen	sense	that he should be married soon , before ( as she imagined ) he could be in orders , and consequently before he could be in possession of the living , surprised her a little at first . but she soon saw how likely it was that lucy , in her self-provident care , in her haste to secure him , should overlook every thing but the risk of delay . they were married , married in town , and now hastening down to her uncle ’ s . what had edward felt on being within four miles from barton , on seeing her mother ’ s servant , on hearing lucy ’ s message !
austen	sense	they would soon , she supposed , be settled at delaford.—delaford , —that place in which so much conspired to give her an interest ; which she wished to be acquainted with , and yet desired to avoid . she saw them in an instant in their parsonage-house ; saw in lucy , the active , contriving manager , uniting at once a desire of smart appearance with the utmost frugality , and ashamed to be suspected of half her economical practices ; —pursuing her own interest in every thought , courting the favour of colonel brandon , of mrs. jennings , and of every wealthy friend . in edward—she knew not what she saw , nor what she wished to see ; —happy or unhappy , —nothing pleased her ; she turned away her head from every sketch of him .
austen	sense	elinor flattered herself that some one of their connections in london would write to them to announce the event , and give farther particulars , —but day after day passed off , and brought no letter , no tidings . though uncertain that any one were to blame , she found fault with every absent friend . they were all thoughtless or indolent .
austen	sense	“ when do you write to colonel brandon , ma ’ am ? ” was an inquiry which sprung from the impatience of her mind to have something going on . “ i wrote to him , my love , last week , and rather expect to see , than to hear from him again . i earnestly pressed his coming to us , and should not be surprised to see him walk in today or tomorrow , or any day . ”
austen	sense	this was gaining something , something to look forward to . colonel brandon _must_ have some information to give . scarcely had she so determined it , when the figure of a man on horseback drew her eyes to the window . he stopt at their gate . it was a gentleman , it was colonel brandon himself . now she could hear more ; and she trembled in expectation of it . but it was _not_ colonel brandon ; neither his air , nor his height . were it possible , she must say it must be edward . she looked again . he had just dismounted : she could not be mistaken , —it _was_ edward . she moved away and sat down . “ he comes from mr. pratt ’ s purposely to see us . i _will_ be calm ; i _will_ be mistress of myself . ”
austen	sense	in a moment she perceived that the others were likewise aware of the mistake . she saw her mother and marianne change colour ; saw them look at herself , and whisper a few sentences to each other . she would have given the world to be able to speak—and to make them understand that she hoped no coolness , no slight , would appear in their behaviour to him ; —but she had no utterance , and was obliged to leave all to their own discretion .
austen	sense	not a syllable passed aloud . they all waited in silence for the appearance of their visitor . his footsteps were heard along the gravel path ; in a moment he was in the passage , and in another he was before them .
austen	sense	his countenance , as he entered the room , was not too happy , even for elinor . his complexion was white with agitation , and he looked as if fearful of his reception , and conscious that he merited no kind one . mrs. dashwood , however , conforming , as she trusted , to the wishes of that daughter , by whom she then meant in the warmth of her heart to be guided in every thing , met him with a look of forced complacency , gave him her hand , and wished him joy .
austen	sense	he coloured , and stammered out an unintelligible reply . elinor ’ s lips had moved with her mother ’ s , and , when the moment of action was over , she wished that she had shaken hands with him too . but it was then too late , and with a countenance meaning to be open , she sat down again and talked of the weather .
austen	sense	marianne had retreated as much as possible out of sight , to conceal her distress ; and margaret , understanding some part , but not the whole of the case , thought it incumbent on her to be dignified , and therefore took a seat as far from him as she could , and maintained a strict silence .
austen	sense	when elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness of the season , a very awful pause took place . it was put an end to by mrs. dashwood , who felt obliged to hope that he had left mrs. ferrars very well . in a hurried manner , he replied in the affirmative .
austen	sense	another pause . elinor resolving to exert herself , though fearing the sound of her own voice , now said , “ is mrs. ferrars at longstaple ? ” “ at longstaple ! ” he replied , with an air of surprise . “ no , my mother is in town . ”
austen	sense	“ i meant , ” said elinor , taking up some work from the table , “ to enquire for mrs. _edward_ ferrars. ” she dared not look up ; —but her mother and marianne both turned their eyes on him . he coloured , seemed perplexed , looked doubtingly , and , after some hesitation , said , —
austen	sense	“ perhaps you mean—my brother—you mean mrs.—mrs . _robert_ ferrars. ” “ mrs . robert ferrars ! ” was repeated by marianne and her mother in an accent of the utmost amazement ; and though elinor could not speak , even _her_ eyes were fixed on him with the same impatient wonder . he rose from his seat , and walked to the window , apparently from not knowing what to do ; took up a pair of scissors that lay there , and while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting the latter to pieces as he spoke , said , in a hurried voice , —
austen	sense	“ perhaps you do not know : you may not have heard that my brother is lately married to—to the youngest—to miss lucy steele. ” his words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment by all but elinor , who sat with her head leaning over her work , in a state of such agitation as made her hardly know where she was .
austen	sense	“ yes , ” said he , “ they were married last week , and are now at dawlish. ” elinor could sit it no longer . she almost ran out of the room , and as soon as the door was closed , burst into tears of joy , which at first she thought would never cease . edward , who had till then looked any where , rather than at her , saw her hurry away , and perhaps saw—or even heard , her emotion ; for immediately afterwards he fell into a reverie , which no remarks , no inquiries , no affectionate address of mrs. dashwood could penetrate , and at last , without saying a word , quitted the room , and walked out towards the village—leaving the others in the greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change in his situation , so wonderful and so sudden ; —a perplexity which they had no means of lessening but by their own conjectures .
austen	sense	chapter xlix . unaccountable , however , as the circumstances of his release might appear to the whole family , it was certain that edward was free ; and to what purpose that freedom would be employed was easily pre-determined by all ; —for after experiencing the blessings of _one_ imprudent engagement , contracted without his mother ’ s consent , as he had already done for more than four years , nothing less could be expected of him in the failure of _that_ , than the immediate contraction of another .
austen	sense	his errand at barton , in fact , was a simple one . it was only to ask elinor to marry him ; —and considering that he was not altogether inexperienced in such a question , it might be strange that he should feel so uncomfortable in the present case as he really did , so much in need of encouragement and fresh air .
austen	sense	how soon he had walked himself into the proper resolution , however , how soon an opportunity of exercising it occurred , in what manner he expressed himself , and how he was received , need not be particularly told . this only need be said ; —that when they all sat down to table at four o ’ clock , about three hours after his arrival , he had secured his lady , engaged her mother ’ s consent , and was not only in the rapturous profession of the lover , but , in the reality of reason and truth , one of the happiest of men . his situation indeed was more than commonly joyful . he had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to swell his heart , and raise his spirits . he was released without any reproach to himself , from an entanglement which had long formed his misery , from a woman whom he had long ceased to love ; —and elevated at once to that security with another , which he must have thought of almost with despair , as soon as he had learnt to consider it with desire . he was brought , not from doubt or suspense , but from misery to happiness ; —and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine , flowing , grateful cheerfulness , as his friends had never witnessed in him before .
austen	sense	his heart was now open to elinor , all its weaknesses , all its errors confessed , and his first boyish attachment to lucy treated with all the philosophic dignity of twenty-four . “ it was a foolish , idle inclination on my side , ” said he , “ the consequence of ignorance of the world , and want of employment . had my mother given me some active profession when i was removed at eighteen from the care of mr. pratt , i think , nay , i am sure , it would never have happened ; for though i left longstaple with what i thought , at the time , a most unconquerable preference for his niece , yet had i then had any pursuit , any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance from her for a few months , i should very soon have outgrown the fancied attachment , especially by mixing more with the world , as in such case i must have done . but instead of having any thing to do , instead of having any profession chosen for me , or being allowed to chuse any myself , i returned home to be completely idle ; and for the first twelvemonth afterwards i had not even the nominal employment , which belonging to the university would have given me ; for i was not entered at oxford till i was nineteen . i had therefore nothing in the world to do , but to fancy myself in love ; and as my mother did not make my home in every respect comfortable , as i had no friend , no companion in my brother , and disliked new acquaintance , it was not unnatural for me to be very often at longstaple , where i always felt myself at home , and was always sure of a welcome ; and accordingly i spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen : lucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging . she was pretty too—at least i thought so _then ; _ and i had seen so little of other women , that i could make no comparisons , and see no defects . considering everything , therefore , i hope , foolish as our engagement was , foolish as it has since in every way been proved , it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable piece of folly . ”
austen	sense	the change which a few hours had wrought in the minds and the happiness of the dashwoods , was such—so great—as promised them all , the satisfaction of a sleepless night . mrs. dashwood , too happy to be comfortable , knew not how to love edward , nor praise elinor enough , how to be enough thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy , nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained conversation together , and yet enjoy , as she wished , the sight and society of both .
austen	sense	marianne could speak _her_ happiness only by tears . comparisons would occur—regrets would arise ; and her joy , though sincere as her love for her sister , was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor language .
austen	sense	but elinor—how are _her_ feelings to be described ? from the moment of learning that lucy was married to another , that edward was free , to the moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed , she was every thing by turns but tranquil . but when the second moment had passed , when she found every doubt , every solicitude removed , compared her situation with what so lately it had been , —saw him honourably released from his former engagement , —saw him instantly profiting by the release , to address herself and declare an affection as tender , as constant as she had ever supposed it to be , —she was oppressed , she was overcome by her own felicity ; and happily disposed as is the human mind to be easily familiarized with any change for the better , it required several hours to give sedateness to her spirits , or any degree of tranquillity to her heart .
austen	sense	edward was now fixed at the cottage at least for a week ; —for whatever other claims might be made on him , it was impossible that less than a week should be given up to the enjoyment of elinor ’ s company , or suffice to say half that was to be said of the past , the present , and the future ; —for though a very few hours spent in the hard labor of incessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be in common between any two rational creatures , yet with lovers it is different . between _them_ no subject is finished , no communication is even made , till it has been made at least twenty times over .
austen	sense	lucy ’ s marriage , the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all , formed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers ; —and elinor ’ s particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her in every view , as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable circumstances she had ever heard . how they could be thrown together , and by what attraction robert could be drawn on to marry a girl , of whose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any admiration , —a girl too already engaged to his brother , and on whose account that brother had been thrown off by his family—it was beyond her comprehension to make out . to her own heart it was a delightful affair , to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one , but to her reason , her judgment , it was completely a puzzle .
austen	sense	edward could only attempt an explanation by supposing , that , perhaps , at first accidentally meeting , the vanity of the one had been so worked on by the flattery of the other , as to lead by degrees to all the rest . elinor remembered what robert had told her in harley street , of his opinion of what his own mediation in his brother ’ s affairs might have done , if applied to in time . she repeated it to edward .
austen	sense	“ _that_ was exactly like robert , ” was his immediate observation . “ and _that_ , ” he presently added , “ might perhaps be in _his_ head when the acquaintance between them first began . and lucy perhaps at first might think only of procuring his good offices in my favour . other designs might afterward arise . ”
austen	sense	how long it had been carrying on between them , however , he was equally at a loss with herself to make out ; for at oxford , where he had remained for choice ever since his quitting london , he had had no means of hearing of her but from herself , and her letters to the very last were neither less frequent , nor less affectionate than usual . not the smallest suspicion , therefore , had ever occurred to prepare him for what followed ; —and when at last it burst on him in a letter from lucy herself , he had been for some time , he believed , half stupified between the wonder , the horror , and the joy of such a deliverance . he put the letter into elinor ’ s hands .
austen	sense	“ dear sir , “ being very sure i have long lost your affections , i have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own on another , and have no doubt of being as happy with him as i once used to think i might be with you ; but i scorn to accept a hand while the heart was another ’ s . sincerely wish you happy in your choice , and it shall not be my fault if we are not always good friends , as our near relationship now makes proper . i can safely say i owe you no ill-will , and am sure you will be too generous to do us any ill offices . your brother has gained my affections entirely , and as we could not live without one another , we are just returned from the altar , and are now on our way to dawlish for a few weeks , which place your dear brother has great curiosity to see , but thought i would first trouble you with these few lines , and shall always remain ,
austen	sense	“ your sincere well-wisher , friend , and sister , “ lucy ferrars . “ i have burnt all your letters , and will return your picture the first opportunity . please to destroy my scrawls—but the ring with my hair you are very welcome to keep . ”
austen	sense	elinor read and returned it without any comment . “ i will not ask your opinion of it as a composition , ” said edward.— “ for worlds would not i have had a letter of hers seen by _you_ in former days.—in a sister it is bad enough , but in a wife ! —how i have blushed over the pages of her writing ! —and i believe i may say that since the first half year of our foolish—business—this is the only letter i ever received from her , of which the substance made me any amends for the defect of the style . ”
austen	sense	“ however it may have come about , ” said elinor , after a pause , — “ they are certainly married . and your mother has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment . the independence she settled on robert , through resentment against you , has put it in his power to make his own choice ; and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand a-year , to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for intending to do . she will hardly be less hurt , i suppose , by robert ’ s marrying lucy , than she would have been by your marrying her . ”
austen	sense	“ she will be more hurt by it , for robert always was her favourite.—she will be more hurt by it , and on the same principle will forgive him much sooner. ” in what state the affair stood at present between them , edward knew not , for no communication with any of his family had yet been attempted by him . he had quitted oxford within four and twenty hours after lucy ’ s letter arrived , and with only one object before him , the nearest road to barton , had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct , with which that road did not hold the most intimate connection . he could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with miss dashwood ; and by his rapidity in seeking _that_ fate , it is to be supposed , in spite of the jealousy with which he had once thought of colonel brandon , in spite of the modesty with which he rated his own deserts , and the politeness with which he talked of his doubts , he did not , upon the whole , expect a very cruel reception . it was his business , however , to say that he _did_ , and he said it very prettily . what he might say on the subject a twelvemonth after , must be referred to the imagination of husbands and wives .
austen	sense	that lucy had certainly meant to deceive , to go off with a flourish of malice against him in her message by thomas , was perfectly clear to elinor ; and edward himself , now thoroughly enlightened on her character , had no scruple in believing her capable of the utmost meanness of wanton ill-nature . though his eyes had been long opened , even before his acquaintance with elinor began , to her ignorance and a want of liberality in some of her opinions—they had been equally imputed , by him , to her want of education ; and till her last letter reached him , he had always believed her to be a well-disposed , good-hearted girl , and thoroughly attached to himself . nothing but such a persuasion could have prevented his putting an end to an engagement , which , long before the discovery of it laid him open to his mother ’ s anger , had been a continual source of disquiet and regret to him .
austen	sense	“ i thought it my duty , ” said he , “ independent of my feelings , to give her the option of continuing the engagement or not , when i was renounced by my mother , and stood to all appearance without a friend in the world to assist me . in such a situation as that , where there seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature , how could i suppose , when she so earnestly , so warmly insisted on sharing my fate , whatever it might be , that any thing but the most disinterested affection was her inducement ? and even now , i can not comprehend on what motive she acted , or what fancied advantage it could be to her , to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard , and who had only two thousand pounds in the world . she could not foresee that colonel brandon would give me a living . ”
austen	sense	“ no ; but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour ; that your own family might in time relent . and at any rate , she lost nothing by continuing the engagement , for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination nor her actions . the connection was certainly a respectable one , and probably gained her consideration among her friends ; and , if nothing more advantageous occurred , it would be better for her to marry _you_ than be single . ”
austen	sense	edward was , of course , immediately convinced that nothing could have been more natural than lucy ’ s conduct , nor more self-evident than the motive of it . elinor scolded him , harshly as ladies always scold the imprudence which compliments themselves , for having spent so much time with them at norland , when he must have felt his own inconstancy .
austen	sense	“ your behaviour was certainly very wrong , ” said she ; “ because—to say nothing of my own conviction , our relations were all led away by it to fancy and expect _what_ , as you were _then_ situated , could never be . ”
austen	sense	he could only plead an ignorance of his own heart , and a mistaken confidence in the force of his engagement . “ i was simple enough to think , that because my _faith_ was plighted to another , there could be no danger in my being with you ; and that the consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour . i felt that i admired you , but i told myself it was only friendship ; and till i began to make comparisons between yourself and lucy , i did not know how far i was got . after that , i suppose , i _was_ wrong in remaining so much in sussex , and the arguments with which i reconciled myself to the expediency of it , were no better than these : —the danger is my own ; i am doing no injury to anybody but myself . ”
austen	sense	elinor smiled , and shook her head . edward heard with pleasure of colonel brandon ’ s being expected at the cottage , as he really wished not only to be better acquainted with him , but to have an opportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented his giving him the living of delaford— “ which , at present , ” said he , “ after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion , he must think i have never forgiven him for offering . ”
austen	sense	_now_ he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been to the place . but so little interest had he taken in the matter , that he owed all his knowledge of the house , garden , and glebe , extent of the parish , condition of the land , and rate of the tithes , to elinor herself , who had heard so much of it from colonel brandon , and heard it with so much attention , as to be entirely mistress of the subject .
austen	sense	one question after this only remained undecided , between them , one difficulty only was to be overcome . they were brought together by mutual affection , with the warmest approbation of their real friends ; their intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make their happiness certain—and they only wanted something to live upon . edward had two thousand pounds , and elinor one , which , with delaford living , was all that they could call their own ; for it was impossible that mrs. dashwood should advance anything ; and they were neither of them quite enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a-year would supply them with the comforts of life .
austen	sense	edward was not entirely without hopes of some favourable change in his mother towards him ; and on _that_ he rested for the residue of their income . but elinor had no such dependence ; for since edward would still be unable to marry miss morton , and his chusing herself had been spoken of in mrs. ferrars ’ s flattering language as only a lesser evil than his chusing lucy steele , she feared that robert ’ s offence would serve no other purpose than to enrich fanny .
austen	sense	about four days after edward ’ s arrival colonel brandon appeared , to complete mrs. dashwood ’ s satisfaction , and to give her the dignity of having , for the first time since her living at barton , more company with her than her house would hold . edward was allowed to retain the privilege of first comer , and colonel brandon therefore walked every night to his old quarters at the park ; from whence he usually returned in the morning , early enough to interrupt the lovers ’ first tête-à-tête before breakfast .
austen	sense	a three weeks ’ residence at delaford , where , in his evening hours at least , he had little to do but to calculate the disproportion between thirty-six and seventeen , brought him to barton in a temper of mind which needed all the improvement in marianne ’ s looks , all the kindness of her welcome , and all the encouragement of her mother ’ s language , to make it cheerful . among such friends , however , and such flattery , he did revive . no rumour of lucy ’ s marriage had yet reached him : —he knew nothing of what had passed ; and the first hours of his visit were consequently spent in hearing and in wondering . every thing was explained to him by mrs. dashwood , and he found fresh reason to rejoice in what he had done for mr. ferrars , since eventually it promoted the interest of elinor .
austen	sense	it would be needless to say , that the gentlemen advanced in the good opinion of each other , as they advanced in each other ’ s acquaintance , for it could not be otherwise . their resemblance in good principles and good sense , in disposition and manner of thinking , would probably have been sufficient to unite them in friendship , without any other attraction ; but their being in love with two sisters , and two sisters fond of each other , made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate , which might otherwise have waited the effect of time and judgment .
austen	sense	the letters from town , which a few days before would have made every nerve in elinor ’ s body thrill with transport , now arrived to be read with less emotion than mirth . mrs. jennings wrote to tell the wonderful tale , to vent her honest indignation against the jilting girl , and pour forth her compassion towards poor mr. edward , who , she was sure , had quite doted upon the worthless hussy , and was now , by all accounts , almost broken-hearted , at oxford . “ i do think , ” she continued , “ nothing was ever carried on so sly ; for it was but two days before lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me . not a soul suspected anything of the matter , not even nancy , who , poor soul ! came crying to me the day after , in a great fright for fear of mrs. ferrars , as well as not knowing how to get to plymouth ; for lucy it seems borrowed all her money before she went off to be married , on purpose we suppose to make a show with , and poor nancy had not seven shillings in the world ; so i was very glad to give her five guineas to take her down to exeter , where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with mrs. burgess , in hopes , as i tell her , to fall in with the doctor again . and i must say that lucy ’ s crossness not to take them along with them in the chaise is worse than all . poor mr. edward ! i can not get him out of my head , but you must send for him to barton , and miss marianne must try to comfort him . ”
austen	sense	mr. dashwood ’ s strains were more solemn . mrs. ferrars was the most unfortunate of women—poor fanny had suffered agonies of sensibility—and he considered the existence of each , under such a blow , with grateful wonder . robert ’ s offence was unpardonable , but lucy ’ s was infinitely worse . neither of them were ever again to be mentioned to mrs. ferrars ; and even , if she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son , his wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter , nor be permitted to appear in her presence . the secrecy with which everything had been carried on between them , was rationally treated as enormously heightening the crime , because , had any suspicion of it occurred to the others , proper measures would have been taken to prevent the marriage ; and he called on elinor to join with him in regretting that lucy ’ s engagement with edward had not rather been fulfilled , than that she should thus be the means of spreading misery farther in the family . he thus continued : —
austen	sense	“ mrs . ferrars has never yet mentioned edward ’ s name , which does not surprise us ; but , to our great astonishment , not a line has been received from him on the occasion . perhaps , however , he is kept silent by his fear of offending , and i shall , therefore , give him a hint , by a line to oxford , that his sister and i both think a letter of proper submission from him , addressed perhaps to fanny , and by her shown to her mother , might not be taken amiss ; for we all know the tenderness of mrs. ferrars ’ s heart , and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be on good terms with her children . ”
austen	sense	this paragraph was of some importance to the prospects and conduct of edward . it determined him to attempt a reconciliation , though not exactly in the manner pointed out by their brother and sister .
austen	sense	“ a letter of proper submission ! ” repeated he ; “ would they have me beg my mother ’ s pardon for robert ’ s ingratitude to _her_ , and breach of honour to _me ? _ i can make no submission . i am grown neither humble nor penitent by what has passed . i am grown very happy ; but that would not interest . i know of no submission that _is_ proper for me to make . ”
austen	sense	“ you may certainly ask to be forgiven , ” said elinor , “ because you have offended ; —and i should think you might _now_ venture so far as to profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew on you your mother ’ s anger . ”
austen	sense	he agreed that he might . “ and when she has forgiven you , perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement , almost as imprudent in _her_ eyes as the first . ”
austen	sense	he had nothing to urge against it , but still resisted the idea of a letter of proper submission ; and therefore , to make it easier to him , as he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions by word of mouth than on paper , it was resolved that , instead of writing to fanny , he should go to london , and personally intreat her good offices in his favour . “ and if they really _do_ interest themselves , ” said marianne , in her new character of candour , “ in bringing about a reconciliation , i shall think that even john and fanny are not entirely without merit . ”
austen	sense	after a visit on colonel brandon ’ s side of only three or four days , the two gentlemen quitted barton together . they were to go immediately to delaford , that edward might have some personal knowledge of his future home , and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what improvements were needed to it ; and from thence , after staying there a couple of nights , he was to proceed on his journey to town .
austen	sense	chapter l. after a proper resistance on the part of mrs. ferrars , just so violent and so steady as to preserve her from that reproach which she always seemed fearful of incurring , the reproach of being too amiable , edward was admitted to her presence , and pronounced to be again her son .
austen	sense	her family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating . for many years of her life she had had two sons ; but the crime and annihilation of edward a few weeks ago , had robbed her of one ; the similar annihilation of robert had left her for a fortnight without any ; and now , by the resuscitation of edward , she had one again .
austen	sense	in spite of his being allowed once more to live , however , he did not feel the continuance of his existence secure , till he had revealed his present engagement ; for the publication of that circumstance , he feared , might give a sudden turn to his constitution , and carry him off as rapidly as before . with apprehensive caution therefore it was revealed , and he was listened to with unexpected calmness . mrs. ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying miss dashwood , by every argument in her power ; —told him , that in miss morton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune ; —and enforced the assertion , by observing that miss morton was the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds , while miss dashwood was only the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than _three ; _ but when she found that , though perfectly admitting the truth of her representation , he was by no means inclined to be guided by it , she judged it wisest , from the experience of the past , to submit—and therefore , after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own dignity , and as served to prevent every suspicion of good-will , she issued her decree of consent to the marriage of edward and elinor .
austen	sense	what she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to be considered ; and here it plainly appeared , that though edward was now her only son , he was by no means her eldest ; for while robert was inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a-year , not the smallest objection was made against edward ’ s taking orders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost ; nor was anything promised either for the present or in future , beyond the ten thousand pounds , which had been given with fanny .
austen	sense	it was as much , however , as was desired , and more than was expected , by edward and elinor ; and mrs. ferrars herself , by her shuffling excuses , seemed the only person surprised at her not giving more .
austen	sense	with an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them , they had nothing to wait for after edward was in possession of the living , but the readiness of the house , to which colonel brandon , with an eager desire for the accommodation of elinor , was making considerable improvements ; and after waiting some time for their completion , after experiencing , as usual , a thousand disappointments and delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen , elinor , as usual , broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying till every thing was ready , and the ceremony took place in barton church early in the autumn .
austen	sense	the first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at the mansion-house ; from whence they could superintend the progress of the parsonage , and direct every thing as they liked on the spot ; —could chuse papers , project shrubberies , and invent a sweep . mrs. jennings ’ s prophecies , though rather jumbled together , were chiefly fulfilled ; for she was able to visit edward and his wife in their parsonage by michaelmas , and she found in elinor and her husband , as she really believed , one of the happiest couples in the world . they had in fact nothing to wish for , but the marriage of colonel brandon and marianne , and rather better pasturage for their cows .
austen	sense	they were visited on their first settling by almost all their relations and friends . mrs. ferrars came to inspect the happiness which she was almost ashamed of having authorised ; and even the dashwoods were at the expense of a journey from sussex to do them honour .
austen	sense	“ i will not say that i am disappointed , my dear sister , ” said john , as they were walking together one morning before the gates of delaford house , “ _that_ would be saying too much , for certainly you have been one of the most fortunate young women in the world , as it is . but , i confess , it would give me great pleasure to call colonel brandon brother . his property here , his place , his house , every thing is in such respectable and excellent condition ! and his woods , —i have not seen such timber any where in dorsetshire , as there is now standing in delaford hanger ! and though , perhaps , marianne may not seem exactly the person to attract him , yet i think it would altogether be advisable for you to have them now frequently staying with you , for as colonel brandon seems a great deal at home , nobody can tell what may happen ; for , when people are much thrown together , and see little of anybody else , —and it will always be in your power to set her off to advantage , and so forth . in short , you may as well give her a chance : you understand me . ”
austen	sense	but though mrs. ferrars _did_ come to see them , and always treated them with the make-believe of decent affection , they were never insulted by her real favour and preference . _that_ was due to the folly of robert , and the cunning of his wife ; and it was earned by them before many months had passed away . the selfish sagacity of the latter , which had at first drawn robert into the scrape , was the principal instrument of his deliverance from it ; for her respectful humility , assiduous attentions , and endless flatteries , as soon as the smallest opening was given for their exercise , reconciled mrs. ferrars to his choice , and re-established him completely in her favour .
austen	sense	the whole of lucy ’ s behaviour in the affair , and the prosperity which crowned it , therefore , may be held forth as a most encouraging instance of what an earnest , an unceasing attention to self-interest , however its progress may be apparently obstructed , will do in securing every advantage of fortune , with no other sacrifice than that of time and conscience . when robert first sought her acquaintance , and privately visited her in bartlett ’ s buildings , it was only with the view imputed to him by his brother . he merely meant to persuade her to give up the engagement ; and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection of both , he naturally expected that one or two interviews would settle the matter . in that point , however , and that only , he erred ; for though lucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence would convince her in _time_ , another visit , another conversation , was always wanted to produce this conviction . some doubts always lingered in her mind when they parted , which could only be removed by another half hour ’ s discourse with himself . his attendance was by this means secured , and the rest followed in course . instead of talking of edward , they came gradually to talk only of robert , —a subject on which he had always more to say than on any other , and in which she soon betrayed an interest even equal to his own ; and in short , it became speedily evident to both , that he had entirely supplanted his brother . he was proud of his conquest , proud of tricking edward , and very proud of marrying privately without his mother ’ s consent . what immediately followed is known . they passed some months in great happiness at dawlish ; for she had many relations and old acquaintances to cut—and he drew several plans for magnificent cottages ; —and from thence returning to town , procured the forgiveness of mrs. ferrars , by the simple expedient of asking it , which , at lucy ’ s instigation , was adopted . the forgiveness , at first , indeed , as was reasonable , comprehended only robert ; and lucy , who had owed his mother no duty and therefore could have transgressed none , still remained some weeks longer unpardoned . but perseverance in humility of conduct and messages , in self-condemnation for robert ’ s offence , and gratitude for the unkindness she was treated with , procured her in time the haughty notice which overcame her by its graciousness , and led soon afterwards , by rapid degrees , to the highest state of affection and influence . lucy became as necessary to mrs. ferrars , as either robert or fanny ; and while edward was never cordially forgiven for having once intended to marry her , and elinor , though superior to her in fortune and birth , was spoken of as an intruder , _she_ was in every thing considered , and always openly acknowledged , to be a favourite child . they settled in town , received very liberal assistance from mrs. ferrars , were on the best terms imaginable with the dashwoods ; and setting aside the jealousies and ill-will continually subsisting between fanny and lucy , in which their husbands of course took a part , as well as the frequent domestic disagreements between robert and lucy themselves , nothing could exceed the harmony in which they all lived together .
austen	sense	what edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest son , might have puzzled many people to find out ; and what robert had done to succeed to it , might have puzzled them still more . it was an arrangement , however , justified in its effects , if not in its cause ; for nothing ever appeared in robert ’ s style of living or of talking to give a suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income , as either leaving his brother too little , or bringing himself too much ; —and if edward might be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in every particular , from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home , and from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits , he might be supposed no less contented with his lot , no less free from every wish of an exchange .
austen	sense	elinor ’ s marriage divided her as little from her family as could well be contrived , without rendering the cottage at barton entirely useless , for her mother and sisters spent much more than half their time with her . mrs. dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasure in the frequency of her visits at delaford ; for her wish of bringing marianne and colonel brandon together was hardly less earnest , though rather more liberal than what john had expressed . it was now her darling object . precious as was the company of her daughter to her , she desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her valued friend ; and to see marianne settled at the mansion-house was equally the wish of edward and elinor . they each felt his sorrows , and their own obligations , and marianne , by general consent , was to be the reward of all .
austen	sense	with such a confederacy against her—with a knowledge so intimate of his goodness—with a conviction of his fond attachment to herself , which at last , though long after it was observable to everybody else—burst on her—what could she do ?
austen	sense	marianne dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate . she was born to discover the falsehood of her own opinions , and to counteract , by her conduct , her most favourite maxims . she was born to overcome an affection formed so late in life as at seventeen , and with no sentiment superior to strong esteem and lively friendship , voluntarily to give her hand to another ! —and _that_ other , a man who had suffered no less than herself under the event of a former attachment , whom , two years before , she had considered too old to be married , —and who still sought the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat !
austen	sense	but so it was . instead of falling a sacrifice to an irresistible passion , as once she had fondly flattered herself with expecting , —instead of remaining even for ever with her mother , and finding her only pleasures in retirement and study , as afterwards in her more calm and sober judgment she had determined on , —she found herself at nineteen , submitting to new attachments , entering on new duties , placed in a new home , a wife , the mistress of a family , and the patroness of a village .
austen	sense	colonel brandon was now as happy , as all those who best loved him , believed he deserved to be ; —in marianne he was consoled for every past affliction ; —her regard and her society restored his mind to animation , and his spirits to cheerfulness ; and that marianne found her own happiness in forming his , was equally the persuasion and delight of each observing friend . marianne could never love by halves ; and her whole heart became , in time , as much devoted to her husband , as it had once been to willoughby .
austen	sense	willoughby could not hear of her marriage without a pang ; and his punishment was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness of mrs. smith , who , by stating his marriage with a woman of character , as the source of her clemency , gave him reason for believing that had he behaved with honour towards marianne , he might at once have been happy and rich . that his repentance of misconduct , which thus brought its own punishment , was sincere , need not be doubted ; —nor that he long thought of colonel brandon with envy , and of marianne with regret . but that he was for ever inconsolable , that he fled from society , or contracted an habitual gloom of temper , or died of a broken heart , must not be depended on—for he did neither . he lived to exert , and frequently to enjoy himself . his wife was not always out of humour , nor his home always uncomfortable ; and in his breed of horses and dogs , and in sporting of every kind , he found no inconsiderable degree of domestic felicity .
austen	sense	for marianne , however , in spite of his incivility in surviving her loss , he always retained that decided regard which interested him in every thing that befell her , and made her his secret standard of perfection in woman ; and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him in after-days as bearing no comparison with mrs. brandon .
austen	sense	mrs. dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage , without attempting a removal to delaford ; and fortunately for sir john and mrs. jennings , when marianne was taken from them , margaret had reached an age highly suitable for dancing , and not very ineligible for being supposed to have a lover .
austen	sense	between barton and delaford , there was that constant communication which strong family affection would naturally dictate ; and among the merits and the happiness of elinor and marianne , let it not be ranked as the least considerable , that though sisters , and living almost within sight of each other , they could live without disagreement between themselves , or producing coolness between their husbands .
christie	ackroyd	“ how much did you overhear ? ” “ not very much , sir . there seemed what i might call a spite against me . of course i had to attend to my duties in the pantry . and when i did creep along once or twice to the study it was no use . the first time dr. sheppard came out and almost caught me in the act , and another time mr. raymond passed me in the big hall and went that way , so i knew it was no use ; and when i went with the tray , miss flora headed me off . ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot stared for a long time at the man , as if to test his sincerity . parker returned his gaze earnestly . “ i hope you believe me , sir . i ’ ve been afraid all along the police would rake up that old business with major ellerby and be suspicious of me in consequence . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ _eh bien_ , ” said poirot at last . “ i am disposed to believe you . but there is one thing i must request of you—to show me your bank-book . you have a bank-book , i presume ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ yes , sir , as a matter of fact , i have it with me now. ” with no sign of confusion , he produced it from his pocket . poirot took the slim , green-covered book and perused the entries .
christie	ackroyd	“ ah ! i perceive you have purchased £500 of national savings certificates this year ? ” “ yes , sir . i have already over a thousand pounds saved—the result of my connection with—er—my late master , major ellerby . and i have had quite a little flutter on some horses this year—very successful . if you remember , sir , a rank outsider won the jubilee . i was fortunate enough to back it—£20 . ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot handed him back the book . “ i will wish you good-morning . i believe that you have told me the truth . if you have not—so much the worse for you , my friend . ”
christie	ackroyd	when parker had departed , poirot picked up his overcoat once more . “ going out again ? ” i asked . “ yes , we will pay a little visit to the good m. hammond. ” “ you believe parker ’ s story ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ it is credible enough on the face of it . it seems clear that—unless he is a very good actor indeed—he genuinely believes it was ackroyd himself who was the victim of blackmail . if so , he knows nothing at all about the mrs. ferrars business . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ then in that case—who—— ” “ _précisément ! _ who ? but our visit to m. hammond will accomplish one purpose . it will either clear parker completely or else—— ” “ well ? ” “ i fall into the bad habit of leaving my sentences unfinished this morning , ” said poirot apologetically . “ you must bear with me . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ by the way , ” i said , rather sheepishly , “ i ’ ve got a confession to make . i ’ m afraid i have inadvertently let out something about that ring. ” “ what ring ? ” “ the ring you found in the goldfish pond . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ ah ! yes , ” said poirot , smiling broadly . “ i hope you ’ re not annoyed ? it was very careless of me. ” “ but not at all , my good friend , not at all . i laid no commands upon you . you were at liberty to speak of it if you so wished . she was interested , your sister ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ she was indeed . it created a sensation . all sorts of theories are flying about. ” “ ah ! and yet it is so simple . the true explanation leapt to the eye , did it not ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ did it ? ” i said dryly . poirot laughed . “ the wise man does not commit himself , ” he observed . “ is not that so ? but here we are at mr. hammond ’ s. ” the lawyer was in his office , and we were ushered in without any delay . he rose and greeted us in his dry , precise manner .
christie	ackroyd	poirot came at once to the point . “ monsieur , i desire from you certain information , that is , if you will be so good as to give it to me . you acted , i understand , for the late mrs. ferrars of king ’ s paddock ? ”
christie	ackroyd	i noticed the swift gleam of surprise which showed in the lawyer ’ s eyes , before his professional reserve came down once more like a mask over his face . “ certainly . all her affairs passed through our hands . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ very good . now , before i ask you to tell me anything , i should like you to listen to the story dr. sheppard will relate to you . you have no objection , have you , my friend , to repeating the conversation you had with mr. ackroyd last friday night ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ not in the least , ” i said , and straightway began the recital of that strange evening . hammond listened with close attention . “ that is all , ” i said , when i had finished . “ blackmail , ” said the lawyer thoughtfully .
christie	ackroyd	“ you are surprised ? ” asked poirot . the lawyer took off his pince-nez and polished them with his handkerchief . “ no , ” he replied , “ i can hardly say that i am surprised . i have suspected something of the kind for some time . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ that brings us , ” said poirot , “ to the information for which i am asking . if any one can give us an idea of the actual sums paid , you are the man , monsieur . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i see no object in withholding the information , ” said hammond , after a moment or two . “ during the past year , mrs. ferrars has sold out certain securities , and the money for them was paid into her account and not reinvested . as her income was a large one , and she lived very quietly after her husband ’ s death , it seems certain that these sums of money were paid away for some special purpose . i once sounded her on the subject , and she said that she was obliged to support several of her husband ’ s poor relations . i let the matter drop , of course . until now , i have always imagined that the money was paid to some woman who had had a claim on ashley ferrars . i never dreamed that mrs. ferrars herself was involved . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ and the amount ? ” asked poirot . “ in all , i should say the various sums totaled at least twenty thousand pounds. ” “ twenty thousand pounds ! ” i exclaimed . “ in one year ! ” “ mrs . ferrars was a very wealthy woman , ” said poirot dryly . “ and the penalty for murder is not a pleasant one . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ is there anything else that i can tell you ? ” inquired mr. hammond . “ i thank you , no , ” said poirot , rising . “ all my excuses for having deranged you. ” “ not at all , not at all . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ the word derange , ” i remarked , when we were outside again , “ is applicable to mental disorder only. ” “ ah ! ” cried poirot , “ never will my english be quite perfect . a curious language . i should then have said disarranged , _n ’ est-ce pas_ ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ disturbed is the word you had in mind. ” “ i thank you , my friend . the word exact , you are zealous for it . _eh bien_ , what about our friend parker now ? with twenty thousand pounds in hand , would he have continued being a butler ? _je ne pense pas._ it is , of course , possible that he banked the money under another name , but i am disposed to believe he spoke the truth to us . if he is a scoundrel , he is a scoundrel on a mean scale . he has not the big ideas . that leaves us as a possibility , raymond , or—well—major blunt . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ surely not raymond , ” i objected . “ since we know that he was desperately hard up for a matter of five hundred pounds. ” “ that is what he says , yes. ” “ and as to hector blunt—— ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i will tell you something as to the good major blunt , ” interrupted poirot . “ it is my business to make inquiries . i make them . _eh bien_—that legacy of which he speaks , i have discovered that the amount of it was close upon twenty thousand pounds . what do you think of that ? ”
christie	ackroyd	i was so taken aback that i could hardly speak . “ it ’ s impossible , ” i said at last . “ a well-known man like hector blunt. ” poirot shrugged his shoulders . “ who knows ? at least he is a man with big ideas . i confess that i hardly see him as a blackmailer , but there is another possibility that you have not even considered . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ what is that ? ” “ the fire , my friend . ackroyd himself may have destroyed that letter , blue envelope and all , after you left him. ” “ i hardly think that likely , ” i said slowly . “ and yet—of course , it may be so . he might have changed his mind . ”
christie	ackroyd	we had just arrived at my house , and on the spur of the moment i invited poirot to come in and take pot luck . i thought caroline would be pleased with me , but it is hard to satisfy one ’ s women folk . it appears that we were eating chops for lunch—the kitchen staff being regaled on tripe and onions . and two chops set before three people are productive of embarrassment .
christie	ackroyd	but caroline is seldom daunted for long . with magnificent mendacity , she explained to poirot that although james laughed at her for doing so , she adhered strictly to a vegetarian diet . she descanted ecstatically on the delights of nut cutlets ( which i am quite sure she has never tasted ) and ate a welsh rarebit with gusto and frequent cutting remarks as to the dangers of “ flesh ” foods .
christie	ackroyd	afterwards , when we were sitting in front of the fire and smoking , caroline attacked poirot directly . “ not found ralph paton yet ? ” she asked . “ where should i find him , mademoiselle ? ” “ i thought , perhaps , you ’ d found him in cranchester , ” said caroline , with intense meaning in her tone .
christie	ackroyd	poirot looked merely bewildered . “ in cranchester ? but why in cranchester ? ” i enlightened him with a touch of malice . “ one of our ample staff of private detectives happened to see you in a car on the cranchester road yesterday , ” i explained .
christie	ackroyd	poirot ’ s bewilderment vanished . he laughed heartily . “ ah , that ! a simple visit to the dentist , _c ’ est tout_ . my tooth , it aches . i go there . my tooth , it is at once better . i think to return quickly . the dentist , he says no . better to have it out . i argue . he insists . he has his way ! that particular tooth , it will never ache again . ”
christie	ackroyd	caroline collapsed rather like a pricked balloon . we fell to discussing ralph paton . “ a weak nature , ” i insisted . “ but not a vicious one. ” “ ah ! ” said poirot . “ but weakness , where does it end ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ exactly , ” said caroline . “ take james here—weak as water , if i weren ’ t about to look after him. ” “ my dear caroline , ” i said irritably , “ can ’ t you talk without dragging in personalities ? ” “ you _are_ weak , james , ” said caroline , quite unmoved . “ i ’ m eight years older than you are—oh ! i don ’ t mind m. poirot knowing that—— ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i should never have guessed it , mademoiselle , ” said poirot , with a gallant little bow . “ eight years older . but i ’ ve always considered it my duty to look after you . with a bad bringing up , heaven knows what mischief you might have got into by now . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i might have married a beautiful adventuress , ” i murmured , gazing at the ceiling , and blowing smoke rings . “ adventuress ! ” said caroline , with a snort . “ if we ’ re talking of adventuresses—— ” she left the sentence unfinished .
christie	ackroyd	“ well ? ” i said , with some curiosity . “ nothing . but i can think of some one not a hundred miles away. ” then she turned to poirot suddenly . “ james sticks to it that you believe some one in the house committed the murder . all i can say is , you ’ re wrong . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i should not like to be wrong , ” said poirot . “ it is not—how do you say—my _métier_ ? ” “ i ’ ve got the facts pretty clearly , ” continued caroline , taking no notice of poirot ’ s remark , “ from james and others . as far as i can see , of the people in the house , only two _could_ have had the chance of doing it . ralph paton and flora ackroyd . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ my dear caroline—— ” “ now , james , don ’ t interrupt me . i know what i ’ m talking about . parker met her _outside_ the door , didn ’ t he ? he didn ’ t hear her uncle saying good-night to her . she could have killed him then and there . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ caroline. ” “ i ’ m not saying she _did_ , james . i ’ m saying she _could_ have done . as a matter of fact , though flora is like all these young girls nowadays , with no veneration for their betters and thinking they know best on every subject under the sun , i don ’ t for a minute believe she ’ d kill even a chicken . but there it is . mr. raymond and major blunt have alibis . mrs. ackroyd ’ s got an alibi . even that russell woman seems to have one—and a good job for her it is she has . who is left ? only ralph and flora ! and say what you will , i don ’ t believe ralph paton is a murderer . a boy we ’ ve known all our lives . ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot was silent for a minute , watching the curling smoke rise from his cigarette . when at last he spoke , it was in a gentle far-away voice that produced a curious impression . it was totally unlike his usual manner .
christie	ackroyd	“ let us take a man—a very ordinary man . a man with no idea of murder in his heart . there is in him somewhere a strain of weakness—deep down . it has so far never been called into play . perhaps it never will be—and if so he will go to his grave honored and respected by every one . but let us suppose that something occurs . he is in difficulties—or perhaps not that even . he may stumble by accident on a secret—a secret involving life or death to some one . and his first impulse will be to speak out—to do his duty as an honest citizen . and then the strain of weakness tells . here is a chance of money—a great amount of money . he wants money—he desires it—and it is so easy . he has to do nothing for it—just keep silence . that is the beginning . the desire for money grows . he must have more—and more ! he is intoxicated by the gold mine which has opened at his feet . he becomes greedy . and in his greed he overreaches himself . one can press a man as far as one likes—but with a woman one must not press too far . for a woman has at heart a great desire to speak the truth . how many husbands who have deceived their wives go comfortably to their graves , carrying their secret with them ! how many wives who have deceived their husbands wreck their lives by throwing the fact in those same husbands ’ teeth ! they have been pressed too far . in a reckless moment ( which they will afterwards regret , _bien entendu_ ) they fling safety to the winds and turn at bay , proclaiming the truth with great momentary satisfaction to themselves . so it was , i think , in this case . the strain was too great . and so there came your proverb , the death of the goose that laid the golden eggs . but that is not the end . exposure faced the man of whom we are speaking . and he is not the same man he was—say , a year ago . his moral fiber is blunted . he is desperate . he is fighting a losing battle , and he is prepared to take any means that come to his hand , for exposure means ruin to him . and so—the dagger strikes ! ”
christie	ackroyd	he was silent for a moment . it was as though he had laid a spell upon the room . i can not try to describe the impression his words produced . there was something in the merciless analysis , and the ruthless power of vision which struck fear into both of us .
christie	ackroyd	“ afterwards , ” he went on softly , “ the danger removed , he will be himself again , normal , kindly . but if the need again arises , then once more he will strike. ” caroline roused herself at last .
christie	ackroyd	“ you are speaking of ralph paton , ” she said . “ you may be right , you may not , but you have no business to condemn a man unheard. ” the telephone bell rang sharply . i went out into the hall , and took off the receiver .
christie	ackroyd	“ what ? ” i said . “ yes . dr. sheppard speaking. ” i listened for a minute or two , then replied briefly . replacing the receiver , i went back into the drawing-room . “ poirot , ” i said , “ they have detained a man at liverpool . his name is charles kent , and he is believed to be the stranger who visited fernly that night . they want me to go to liverpool at once and identify him . ”
christie	ackroyd	chapter xviii charles kent half an hour later saw poirot , myself , and inspector raglan in the train on the way to liverpool . the inspector was clearly very excited . “ we may get a line on the blackmailing part of the business , if on nothing else , ” he declared jubilantly . “ he ’ s a rough customer , this fellow , by what i heard over the phone . takes dope , too . we ought to find it easy to get what we want out of him . if there was the shadow of a motive , nothing ’ s more likely than that he killed mr. ackroyd . but in that case , why is young paton keeping out of the way ? the whole thing ’ s a muddle—that ’ s what it is . by the way , m. poirot , you were quite right about those fingerprints . they were mr. ackroyd ’ s own . i had rather the same idea myself , but i dismissed it as hardly feasible . ”
christie	ackroyd	i smiled to myself . inspector raglan was so very plainly saving his face . “ as regards this man , ” said poirot , “ he is not yet arrested , eh ? ” “ no , detained under suspicion. ” “ and what account does he give of himself ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ precious little , ” said the inspector , with a grin . “ he ’ s a wary bird , i gather . a lot of abuse , but very little more. ” on arrival at liverpool i was surprised to find that poirot was welcomed with acclamation . superintendent hayes , who met us , had worked with poirot over some case long ago , and had evidently an exaggerated opinion of his powers .
christie	ackroyd	“ now we ’ ve got m. poirot here we shan ’ t be long , ” he said cheerfully . “ i thought you ’ d retired , moosior ? ” “ so i had , my good hayes , so i had . but how tedious is retirement ! you can not imagine to yourself the monotony with which day comes after day . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ very likely . so you ’ ve come to have a look at our own particular find ? is this dr. sheppard ? think you ’ ll be able to identify him , sir ? ” “ i ’ m not very sure , ” i said doubtfully .
christie	ackroyd	“ how did you get hold of him ? ” inquired poirot . “ description was circulated , as you know . in the press and privately . not much to go on , i admit . this fellow has an american accent all right , and he doesn ’ t deny that he was near king ’ s abbot that night . just asks what the hell it is to do with us , and that he ’ ll see us in —— before he answers any questions . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ is it permitted that i , too , see him ? ” asked poirot . the superintendent closed one eye knowingly . “ very glad to have you , sir . you ’ ve got permission to do anything you please . inspector japp of scotland yard was asking after you the other day . said he ’ d heard you were connected unofficially with this case . where ’ s captain paton hiding , sir , can you tell me that ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i doubt if it would be wise at the present juncture , ” said poirot primly , and i bit my lips to prevent a smile . the little man really did it very well .
christie	ackroyd	after some further parley , we were taken to interview the prisoner . he was a young fellow , i should say not more than twenty-two or three . tall , thin , with slightly shaking hands , and the evidences of considerable physical strength somewhat run to seed . his hair was dark , but his eyes were blue and shifty , seldom meeting a glance squarely . i had all along cherished the illusion that there was something familiar about the figure i had met that night , but if this were indeed he , i was completely mistaken . he did not remind me in the least of any one i knew .
christie	ackroyd	“ now then , kent , ” said the superintendent , “ stand up . here are some visitors come to see you . recognize any of them. ” kent glared at us sullenly , but did not reply . i saw his glance waver over the three of us , and come back to rest on me .
christie	ackroyd	“ well , sir , ” said the superintendent to me , “ what do you say ? ” “ the height ’ s the same , ” i said , “ and as far as general appearance goes it might well be the man in question . beyond that , i couldn ’ t go . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ what the hell ’ s the meaning of all this ? ” asked kent . “ what have you got against me ? come on , out with it ! what am i supposed to have done ? ” i nodded my head .
christie	ackroyd	“ it ’ s the man , ” i said . “ i recognize the voice. ” “ recognize my voice , do you ? where do you think you heard it before ? ” “ on friday evening last , outside the gates of fernly park . you asked me the way there . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i did , did i ? ” “ do you admit it ? ” asked the inspector . “ i don ’ t admit anything . not till i know what you ’ ve got on me. ” “ have you not read the papers in the last few days ? ” asked poirot , speaking for the first time .
christie	ackroyd	the man ’ s eyes narrowed . “ so that ’ s it , is it ? i saw an old gent had been croaked at fernly . trying to make out i did the job , are you ? ” “ you were there that night , ” said poirot quietly .
christie	ackroyd	“ how do you know , mister ? ” “ by this. ” poirot took something from his pocket and held it out . it was the goose quill we had found in the summer-house . at the sight of it the man ’ s face changed . he half held out his hand .
christie	ackroyd	“ snow , ” said poirot thoughtfully . “ no , my friend , it is empty . it lay where you dropped it in the summer-house that night. ” charles kent looked at him uncertainly . “ you seem to know a hell of a lot about everything , you little foreign cock duck . perhaps you remember this : the papers say that the old gent was croaked between a quarter to ten and ten o ’ clock ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ that is so , ” agreed poirot . “ yes , but is it really so ? that ’ s what i ’ m getting at. ” “ this gentleman will tell you , ” said poirot . he indicated inspector raglan . the latter hesitated , glanced at superintendent hayes , then at poirot , and finally , as though receiving sanction , he said : —
christie	ackroyd	“ that ’ s right . between a quarter to ten and ten o ’ clock. ” “ then you ’ ve nothing to keep me here for , ” said kent . “ i was away from fernly park by twenty-five minutes past nine . you can ask at the dog and whistle . that ’ s a saloon about a mile out of fernly on the road to cranchester . i kicked up a bit of a row there , i remember . as near as nothing to quarter to ten , it was . how about that ? ”
christie	ackroyd	inspector raglan wrote down something in his notebook . “ well ? ” demanded kent . “ inquiries will be made , ” said the inspector . “ if you ’ ve spoken the truth , you won ’ t have anything to complain about . what were you doing at fernly park anyway ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ went there to meet some one. ” “ who ? ” “ that ’ s none of your business. ” “ you ’ d better keep a civil tongue in your head , my man , ” the superintendent warned him . “ to hell with a civil tongue . i went there on my own business , and that ’ s all there is to it . if i was clear away before the murder was done , that ’ s all that concerns the cops . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ your name , it is charles kent , ” said poirot . “ where were you born ? ” the man stared at him , then he grinned . “ i ’ m a full-blown britisher all right , ” he said . “ yes , ” said poirot meditatively , “ i think you are . i fancy you were born in kent . ”
christie	ackroyd	the man stared . “ why ’ s that ? because of my name ? what ’ s that to do with it ? is a man whose name is kent bound to be born in that particular county ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ under certain circumstances , i can imagine he might be , ” said poirot very deliberately . “ under certain circumstances , you comprehend. ” there was so much meaning in his voice as to surprise the two police officers . as for charles kent , he flushed a brick red , and for a moment i thought he was going to spring at poirot . he thought better of it , however , and turned away with a kind of laugh .
christie	ackroyd	poirot nodded as though satisfied , and made his way out through the door . he was joined presently by the two officers . “ we ’ ll verify that statement , ” remarked raglan . “ i don ’ t think he ’ s lying , though . but he ’ s got to come clear with a statement as to what he was doing at fernly . it looks to me as though we ’ d got our blackmailer all right . on the other hand , granted his story ’ s correct , he couldn ’ t have had anything to do with the actual murder . he ’ d got ten pounds on him when he was arrested—rather a large sum . i fancy that forty pounds went to him—the numbers of the notes didn ’ t correspond , but of course he ’ d have changed them first thing . mr. ackroyd must have given him the money , and he made off with it as fast as possible . what was that about kent being his birthplace ? what ’ s that got to do with it ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ nothing whatever , ” said poirot mildly . “ a little idea of mine , that was all . me , i am famous for my little ideas. ” “ are you really ? ” said raglan , studying him with a puzzled expression .
christie	ackroyd	the superintendent went into a roar of laughter . “ many ’ s the time i ’ ve heard inspector japp say that . m. poirot and his little ideas ! too fanciful for me , he ’ d say , but always something in them . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ you mock yourself at me , ” said poirot , smiling ; “ but never mind . the old ones they laugh last sometimes , when the young , clever ones do not laugh at all. ” and nodding his head at them in a sage manner , he walked out into the street .
christie	ackroyd	he and i lunched together at an hotel . i know now that the whole thing lay clearly unravelled before him . he had got the last thread he needed to lead him to the truth .
christie	ackroyd	but at the time i had no suspicion of the fact . i overestimated his general self-confidence , and i took it for granted that the things which puzzled me must be equally puzzling to him .
christie	ackroyd	my chief puzzle was what the man charles kent could have been doing at fernly . again and again i put the question to myself and could get no satisfactory reply .
christie	ackroyd	at last i ventured a tentative query to poirot . his reply was immediate . “ _mon ami_ , i do not think ; i know. ” “ really ? ” i said incredulously . “ yes , indeed . i suppose now that to you it would not make sense if i said that he went to fernly that night because he was born in kent ? ”
christie	ackroyd	i stared at him . “ it certainly doesn ’ t seem to make sense to me , ” i said dryly . “ ah ! ” said poirot pityingly . “ well , no matter . i have still my little idea. ” chapter xix
christie	ackroyd	flora ackroyd as i was returning from my round the following morning , i was hailed by inspector raglan . i pulled up , and the inspector mounted on the step . “ good-morning , dr. sheppard , ” he said . “ well , that alibi is all right enough . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ charles kent ’ s ? ” “ charles kent ’ s . the barmaid at the dog and whistle , sally jones , she remembers him perfectly . picked out his photograph from among five others . it was just a quarter to ten when he came into the bar , and the dog and whistle is well over a mile from fernly park . the girl mentions that he had a lot of money on him—she saw him take a handful of notes out of his pocket . rather surprised her , it did , seeing the class of fellow he was , with a pair of boots clean dropping off him . that ’ s where that forty pounds went right enough . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ the man still refuses to give an account of his visit to fernly ? ” “ obstinate as a mule he is . i had a chat with hayes at liverpool over the wire this morning . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ hercule poirot says he knows the reason the man went there that night , ” i observed . “ does he ? ” cried the inspector eagerly . “ yes , ” i said maliciously . “ he says he went there because he was born in kent . ”
christie	ackroyd	i felt a distinct pleasure in passing on my own discomfiture . raglan stared at me for a moment or two uncomprehendingly . then a grin overspread his weaselly countenance and he tapped his forehead significantly .
christie	ackroyd	“ bit gone here , ” he said . “ i ’ ve thought so for some time . poor old chap , so that ’ s why he had to give up and come down here . in the family , very likely . he ’ s got a nephew who ’ s quite off his crumpet . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ poirot has ? ” i said , very surprised . “ yes . hasn ’ t he ever mentioned him to you ? quite docile , i believe , and all that , but mad as a hatter , poor lad. ” “ who told you that ? ”
christie	ackroyd	again a grin showed itself on inspector raglan ’ s face . “ your sister , miss sheppard , she told me all about it. ” really , caroline is amazing . she never rests until she knows the last details of everybody ’ s family secrets . unfortunately , i have never been able to instill into her the decency of keeping them to herself .
christie	ackroyd	“ jump in , inspector , ” i said , opening the door of the car . “ we ’ ll go up to the larches together , and acquaint our belgian friend with the latest news. ” “ might as well , i suppose . after all , even if he is a bit balmy , it was a useful tip he gave me about those fingerprints . he ’ s got a bee in his bonnet about the man kent , but who knows—there may be something useful behind it . ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot received us with his usual smiling courtesy . he listened to the information we had brought him , nodding his head now and then . “ seems quite o.k. , doesn ’ t it ? ” said the inspector rather gloomily . “ a chap can ’ t be murdering some one in one place when he ’ s drinking in the bar in another place a mile away . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ are you going to release him ? ” “ don ’ t see what else we can do . we can ’ t very well hold him for obtaining money on false pretences . can ’ t prove a ruddy thing . ”
christie	ackroyd	the inspector tossed a match into the grate in a disgruntled fashion . poirot retrieved it and put it neatly in a little receptacle designed for the purpose . his action was purely mechanical . i could see that his thoughts were on something very different .
christie	ackroyd	“ if i were you , ” he said at last , “ i should not release the man charles kent yet. ” “ what do you mean ? ” raglan stared at him . “ what i say . i should not release him yet . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ you don ’ t think he can have had anything to do with the murder , do you ? ” “ i think probably not—but one can not be certain yet. ” “ but haven ’ t i just told you—— ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot raised a hand protestingly . “ _mais oui , mais oui._ i heard . i am not deaf—nor stupid , thank the good god ! but see you , you approach the matter from the wrong—the wrong—premises , is not that the word ? ”
christie	ackroyd	the inspector stared at him heavily . “ i don ’ t see how you make that out . look here , we know mr. ackroyd was alive at a quarter to ten . you admit that , don ’ t you ? ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot looked at him for a moment , then shook his head with a quick smile . “ i admit nothing that is not—_proved_ ! ” “ well , we ’ ve got proof enough of that . we ’ ve got miss flora ackroyd ’ s evidence . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ that she said good-night to her uncle ? but me—i do not always believe what a young lady tells me—no , not even when she is charming and beautiful. ” “ but hang it all , man , parker saw her coming out of the door . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ no. ” poirot ’ s voice rang out with sudden sharpness . “ that is just what he did not see . i satisfied myself of that by a little experiment the other day—you remember , doctor ? parker saw her _outside_ the door , with her hand on the handle . he did not see her come out of the room . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ but—where else could she have been ? ” “ perhaps on the stairs. ” “ the stairs ? ” “ that is my little idea—yes. ” “ but those stairs only lead to mr. ackroyd ’ s bedroom. ” “ precisely. ” and still the inspector stared .
christie	ackroyd	“ you think she ’ d been up to her uncle ’ s bedroom ? well , why not ? why should she lie about it ? ” “ ah ! that is just the question . it depends on what she was doing there , does it not ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ you mean—the money ? hang it all , you don ’ t suggest that it was miss ackroyd who took that forty pounds ? ” “ i suggest nothing , ” said poirot . “ but i will remind you of this . life was not very easy for that mother and daughter . there were bills—there was constant trouble over small sums of money . roger ackroyd was a peculiar man over money matters . the girl might be at her wit ’ s end for a comparatively small sum . figure to yourself then what happens . she has taken the money , she descends the little staircase . when she is half-way down she hears the chink of glass from the hall . she has not a doubt of what it is—parker coming to the study . at all costs she must not be found on the stairs—parker will not forget it , he will think it odd . if the money is missed , parker is sure to remember having seen her come down those stairs . she has just time to rush down to the study door—with her hand on the handle to show that she has just come out , when parker appears in the doorway . she says the first thing that comes into her head , a repetition of roger ackroyd ’ s orders earlier in the evening , and then goes upstairs to her own room . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ yes , but later , ” persisted the inspector , “ she must have realized the vital importance of speaking the truth ? why , the whole case hinges on it ! ” “ afterwards , ” said poirot dryly , “ it was a little difficult for mademoiselle flora . she is told simply that the police are here and that there has been a robbery . naturally she jumps to the conclusion that the theft of the money has been discovered . her one idea is to stick to her story . when she learns that her uncle is dead she is panic-stricken . young women do not faint nowadays , monsieur , without considerable provocation . _eh bien ! _ there it is . she is bound to stick to her story , or else confess everything . and a young and pretty girl does not like to admit that she is a thief—especially before those whose esteem she is anxious to retain . ”
christie	ackroyd	raglan brought his fist down with a thump on the table . “ i ’ ll not believe it , ” he said . “ it ’ s—it ’ s not credible . and you—you ’ ve known this all along ? ” “ the possibility has been in my mind from the first , ” admitted poirot . “ i was always convinced that mademoiselle flora was hiding something from us . to satisfy myself , i made the little experiment i told you of . dr. sheppard accompanied me . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ a test for parker , you said it was , ” i remarked bitterly . “ _mon ami_ , ” said poirot apologetically , “ as i told you at the time , one must say something. ” the inspector rose .
christie	ackroyd	“ there ’ s only one thing for it , ” he declared . “ we must tackle the young lady right away . you ’ ll come up to fernly with me , m. poirot ? ” “ certainly . dr. sheppard will drive us up in his car . ”
christie	ackroyd	i acquiesced willingly . on inquiry for miss ackroyd , we were shown into the billiard room . flora and major hector blunt were sitting on the long window seat . “ good-morning , miss ackroyd , ” said the inspector . “ can we have a word or two alone with you ? ”
christie	ackroyd	blunt got up at once and moved to the door . “ what is it ? ” asked flora nervously . “ don ’ t go , major blunt . he can stay , can ’ t he ? ” she asked , turning to the inspector .
christie	ackroyd	“ that ’ s as you like , ” said the inspector dryly . “ there ’ s a question or two it ’ s my duty to put to you , miss , but i ’ d prefer to do so privately , and i dare say you ’ d prefer it also . ”
christie	ackroyd	flora looked keenly at him . i saw her face grow whiter . then she turned and spoke to blunt . “ i want you to stay—please—yes , i mean it . whatever the inspector has to say to me , i ’ d rather you heard it . ”
christie	ackroyd	raglan shrugged his shoulders . “ well , if you will have it so , that ’ s all there is to it . now , miss ackroyd , m. poirot here has made a certain suggestion to me . he suggests that you weren ’ t in the study at all last friday night , that you never saw mr. ackroyd to say good-night to him , that instead of being in the study you were on the stairs leading down from your uncle ’ s bedroom when you heard parker coming across the hall . ”
christie	ackroyd	flora ’ s gaze shifted to poirot . he nodded back at her . “ mademoiselle , the other day , when we sat round the table , i implored you to be frank with me . what one does not tell to papa poirot he finds out . it was that , was it not ? see , i will make it easy for you . you took the money , did you not ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ the money , ” said blunt sharply . there was a silence which lasted for at least a minute . then flora drew herself up and spoke . “ m . poirot is right . i took that money . i stole . i am a thief—yes , a common , vulgar little thief . now you know ! i am glad it has come out . it ’ s been a nightmare , these last few days ! ” she sat down suddenly and buried her face in her hands . she spoke huskily through her fingers . “ you don ’ t know what my life has been since i came here . wanting things , scheming for them , lying , cheating , running up bills , promising to pay—oh ! i hate myself when i think of it all ! that ’ s what brought us together , ralph and i . we were both weak ! i understood him , and i was sorry—because i ’ m the same underneath . we ’ re not strong enough to stand alone , either of us . we ’ re weak , miserable , despicable things . ”
christie	ackroyd	she looked at blunt and suddenly stamped her foot . “ why do you look at me like that—as though you couldn ’ t believe ? i may be a thief—but at any rate i ’ m real now . i ’ m not lying any more . i ’ m not pretending to be the kind of girl you like , young and innocent and simple . i don ’ t care if you never want to see me again . i hate myself , despise myself—but you ’ ve got to believe one thing , if speaking the truth would have made things better for ralph , i would have spoken out . but i ’ ve seen all along that it wouldn ’ t be better for ralph—it makes the case against him blacker than ever . i was not doing him any harm by sticking to my lie . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ ralph , ” said blunt . “ i see—always ralph. ” “ you don ’ t understand , ” said flora hopelessly . “ you never will. ” she turned to the inspector . “ i admit everything ; i was at my wit ’ s end for money . i never saw my uncle that evening after he left the dinner-table . as to the money , you can take what steps you please . nothing could be worse than it is now ! ”
christie	ackroyd	suddenly she broke down again , hid her face in her hands , and rushed from the room . “ well , ” said the inspector in a flat tone , “ so that ’ s that. ” he seemed rather at a loss what to do next .
christie	ackroyd	blunt came forward . “ inspector raglan , ” he said quietly , “ that money was given to me by mr. ackroyd for a special purpose . miss ackroyd never touched it . when she says she did , she is lying with the idea of shielding captain paton . the truth is as i said , and i am prepared to go into the witness box and swear to it . ”
christie	ackroyd	he made a kind of jerky bow , then turning abruptly , he left the room . poirot was after him in a flash . he caught the other up in the hall . “ monsieur—a moment , i beg of you , if you will be so good . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ well , sir ? ” blunt was obviously impatient . he stood frowning down on poirot . “ it is this , ” said poirot rapidly : “ i am not deceived by your little fantasy . no , indeed . it was truly miss flora who took the money . all the same it is well imagined what you say—it pleases me . it is very good what you have done there . you are a man quick to think and to act . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i ’ m not in the least anxious for your opinion , thank you , ” said blunt coldly . he made once more as though to pass on , but poirot , not at all offended , laid a detaining hand on his arm .
christie	ackroyd	“ ah ! but you are to listen to me . i have more to say . the other day i spoke of concealments . very well , all along have i seen what you are concealing . mademoiselle flora , you love her with all your heart . from the first moment you saw her , is it not so ? oh ! let us not mind saying these things—why must one in england think it necessary to mention love as though it were some disgraceful secret ? you love mademoiselle flora . you seek to conceal that fact from all the world . that is very good—that is as it should be . but take the advice of hercule poirot—do not conceal it from mademoiselle herself . ”
christie	ackroyd	blunt had shown several signs of restlessness whilst poirot was speaking , but the closing words seemed to rivet his attention . “ what d ’ you mean by that ? ” he said sharply . “ you think that she loves the capitaine ralph paton—but i , hercule poirot , tell you that that is not so . mademoiselle flora accepted captain paton to please her uncle , and because she saw in the marriage a way of escape from her life here which was becoming frankly insupportable to her . she liked him , and there was much sympathy and understanding between them . but love—no ! it is not captain paton mademoiselle flora loves . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ what the devil do you mean ? ” asked blunt . i saw the dark flush under his tan . “ you have been blind , monsieur . blind ! she is loyal , the little one . ralph paton is under a cloud , she is bound in honor to stick by him . ”
christie	ackroyd	i felt it was time i put in a word to help on the good work . “ my sister told me the other night , ” i said encouragingly , “ that flora had never cared a penny piece for ralph paton , and never would . my sister is always right about these things . ”
christie	ackroyd	blunt ignored my well-meant efforts . he spoke to poirot . “ d ’ you really think—— ” he began , and stopped . he is one of those inarticulate men who find it hard to put things into words .
christie	ackroyd	poirot knows no such disability . “ if you doubt me , ask her yourself , monsieur . but perhaps you no longer care to—the affair of the money—— ” blunt gave a sound like an angry laugh .
christie	ackroyd	“ think i ’ d hold that against her ? roger was always a queer chap about money . she got in a mess and didn ’ t dare tell him . poor kid . poor lonely kid. ” poirot looked thoughtfully at the side door .
christie	ackroyd	“ mademoiselle flora went into the garden , i think , ” he murmured . “ i ’ ve been every kind of a fool , ” said blunt abruptly . “ rum conversation we ’ ve been having . like one of those danish plays . but you ’ re a sound fellow , m. poirot . thank you . ”
christie	ackroyd	he took poirot ’ s hand and gave it a grip which caused the other to wince in anguish . then he strode to the side door and passed out into the garden .
christie	ackroyd	“ not every kind of a fool , ” murmured poirot , tenderly nursing the injured member . “ only one kind—the fool in love. ” chapter xx miss russell inspector raglan had received a bad jolt . he was not deceived by blunt ’ s valiant lie any more than we had been . our way back to the village was punctuated by his complaints .
christie	ackroyd	“ this alters everything , this does . i don ’ t know whether you ’ ve realized it , monsieur poirot ? ” “ i think so , yes , i think so , ” said poirot . “ you see , me , i have been familiar with the idea for some time . ”
christie	ackroyd	inspector raglan , who had only had the idea presented to him a short half-hour ago , looked at poirot unhappily , and went on with his discoveries . “ those alibis now . worthless ! absolutely worthless . got to start again . find out what every one was doing from nine-thirty onwards . nine-thirty—that ’ s the time we ’ ve got to hang on to . you were quite right about the man kent—we don ’ t release _him_ yet awhile . let me see now—nine-forty-five at the dog and whistle . he might have got there in a quarter of an hour if he ran . it ’ s just possible that it was _his_ voice mr. raymond heard talking to mr. ackroyd—asking for money which mr. ackroyd refused . but one thing ’ s clear—it wasn ’ t he who sent the telephone message . the station is half a mile in the other direction—over a mile and a half from the dog and whistle , and he was at the dog and whistle until about ten minutes past ten . dang that telephone call ! we always come up against it . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ we do indeed , ” agreed poirot . “ it is curious. ” “ it ’ s just possible that if captain paton climbed into his uncle ’ s room and found him there murdered , _he_ may have sent it . got the wind up , thought he ’ d be accused , and cleared out . that ’ s possible , isn ’ t it ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ why should he have telephoned ? ” “ may have had doubts if the old man was really dead . thought he ’ d get the doctor up there as soon as possible , but didn ’ t want to give himself away . yes , i say now , how ’ s that for a theory ? something in that , i should say . ”
christie	ackroyd	the inspector swelled his chest out importantly . he was so plainly delighted with himself that any words of ours would have been quite superfluous . we arrived back at my house at this minute , and i hurried in to my surgery patients , who had all been waiting a considerable time , leaving poirot to walk to the police station with the inspector .
christie	ackroyd	having dismissed the last patient , i strolled into the little room at the back of the house which i call my workshop—i am rather proud of the home-made wireless set i turned out . caroline hates my workroom . i keep my tools there , and annie is not allowed to wreak havoc with a dustpan and brush . i was just adjusting the interior of an alarm clock which had been denounced as wholly unreliable by the household , when the door opened and caroline put her head in .
christie	ackroyd	“ oh ! there you are , james , ” she said , with deep disapproval . “ m . poirot wants to see you. ” “ well , ” i said , rather irritably , for her sudden entrance had startled me and i had let go of a piece of delicate mechanism , “ if he wants to see me , he can come in here . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ in here ? ” said caroline . “ that ’ s what i said—in here. ” caroline gave a sniff of disapproval and retired . she returned in a moment or two , ushering in poirot , and then retired again , shutting the door with a bang .
christie	ackroyd	“ aha ! my friend , ” said poirot , coming forward and rubbing his hands . “ you have not got rid of me so easily , you see ! ” “ finished with the inspector ? ” i asked . “ for the moment , yes . and you , you have seen all the patients ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ yes. ” poirot sat down and looked at me , tilting his egg-shaped head on one side , with the air of one who savors a very delicious joke . “ you are in error , ” he said at last . “ you have still one patient to see . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ not you ? ” i exclaimed in surprise . “ ah , not me , _bien entendu_ . me , i have the health magnificent . no , to tell you the truth , it is a little _complot_ of mine . there is some one i wish to see , you understand—and at the same time it is not necessary that the whole village should intrigue itself about the matter—which is what would happen if the lady were seen to come to my house—for it is a lady . but to you she has already come as a patient before . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ miss russell ! ” i exclaimed . “ _précisément._ i wish much to speak with her , so i send her the little note and make the appointment in your surgery . you are not annoyed with me ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ on the contrary , ” i said . “ that is , presuming i am allowed to be present at the interview ? ” “ but naturally ! in your own surgery ! ” “ you know , ” i said , throwing down the pincers i was holding , “ it ’ s extraordinarily intriguing , the whole thing . every new development that arises is like the shake you give to a kaleidoscope—the thing changes entirely in aspect . now , why are you so anxious to see miss russell ? ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot raised his eyebrows . “ surely it is obvious ? ” he murmured . “ there you go again , ” i grumbled . “ according to you everything is obvious . but you leave me walking about in a fog . ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot shook his head genially at me . “ you mock yourself at me . take the matter of mademoiselle flora . the inspector was surprised—but you—you were not. ” “ i never dreamed of her being the thief , ” i expostulated .
christie	ackroyd	“ that—perhaps no . but i was watching your face and you were not—like inspector raglan—startled and incredulous. ” i thought for a minute or two . “ perhaps you are right , ” i said at last . “ all along i ’ ve felt that flora was keeping back something—so the truth , when it came , was subconsciously expected . it upset inspector raglan very much indeed , poor man . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ ah ! _pour ça , oui_ ! the poor man must rearrange all his ideas . i profited by his state of mental chaos to induce him to grant me a little favor. ” “ what was that ? ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot took a sheet of notepaper from his pocket . some words were written on it , and he read them aloud . “ the police have , for some days , been seeking for captain ralph paton , the nephew of mr. ackroyd of fernly park , whose death occurred under such tragic circumstances last friday . captain paton has been found at liverpool , where he was on the point of embarking for america . ”
christie	ackroyd	he folded up the piece of paper again . “ that , my friend , will be in the newspapers to-morrow morning. ” i stared at him , dumbfounded . “ but—but it isn ’ t true ! he ’ s not at liverpool ! ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot beamed on me . “ you have the intelligence so quick ! no , he has not been found at liverpool . inspector raglan was very loath to let me send this paragraph to the press , especially as i could not take him into my confidence . but i assured him most solemnly that very interesting results would follow its appearance in print , so he gave in , after stipulating that he was , on no account , to bear the responsibility . ”
christie	ackroyd	i stared at poirot . he smiled back at me . “ it beats me , ” i said at last , “ what you expect to get out of that. ” “ you should employ your little gray cells , ” said poirot gravely .
christie	ackroyd	he rose and came across to the bench . “ it is that you have really the love of the machinery , ” he said , after inspecting the débris of my labors . every man has his hobby . i immediately drew poirot ’ s attention to my home-made wireless . finding him sympathetic , i showed him one or two little inventions of my own—trifling things , but useful in the house .
christie	ackroyd	“ decidedly , ” said poirot , “ you should be an inventor by trade , not a doctor . but i hear the bell—that is your patient . let us go into the surgery. ” once before i had been struck by the remnants of beauty in the housekeeper ’ s face . this morning i was struck anew . very simply dressed in black , tall , upright and independent as ever , with her big dark eyes and an unwonted flush of color in her usually pale cheeks , i realized that as a girl she must have been startlingly handsome .
christie	ackroyd	“ good-morning , mademoiselle , ” said poirot . “ will you be seated ? dr. sheppard is so kind as to permit me the use of his surgery for a little conversation i am anxious to have with you . ”
christie	ackroyd	miss russell sat down with her usual composure . if she felt any inward agitation , it did not display itself in any outward manifestation . “ it seems a queer way of doing things , if you ’ ll allow me to say so , ” she remarked .
christie	ackroyd	“ miss russell—i have news to give you. ” “ indeed ! ” “ charles kent has been arrested at liverpool. ” not a muscle of her face moved . she merely opened her eyes a trifle wider , and asked , with a tinge of defiance :
christie	ackroyd	“ well , what of it ? ” but at that moment it came to me—the resemblance that had haunted me all along , something familiar in the defiance of charles kent ’ s manner . the two voices , one rough and coarse , the other painfully ladylike—were strangely the same in timbre . it was of miss russell that i had been reminded that night outside the gates of fernly park .
christie	ackroyd	i looked at poirot , full of my discovery , and he gave me an imperceptible nod . in answer to miss russell ’ s question , he threw out his hands in a thoroughly french gesture .
christie	ackroyd	“ i thought you might be interested , that is all , ” he said mildly . “ well , i ’ m not particularly , ” said miss russell . “ who is this charles kent anyway ? ” “ he is a man , mademoiselle , who was at fernly on the night of the murder . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ really ? ” “ fortunately for him , he has an alibi . at a quarter to ten he was at a public-house a mile from here. ” “ lucky for him , ” commented miss russell . “ but we still do not know what he was doing at fernly—who it was he went to meet , for instance . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i ’ m afraid i can ’ t help you at all , ” said the housekeeper politely . “ nothing came to _my_ ears . if that is all—— ” she made a tentative movement as though to rise . poirot stopped her .
christie	ackroyd	“ it is not quite all , ” he said smoothly . “ this morning fresh developments have arisen . it seems now that mr. ackroyd was murdered , not at a quarter to ten , but _before_ . between ten minutes to nine , when dr. sheppard left , and a quarter to ten . ”
christie	ackroyd	i saw the color drain from the housekeeper ’ s face , leaving it dead white . she leaned forward , her figure swaying . “ but miss ackroyd said—miss ackroyd said—— ” “ miss ackroyd has admitted that she was lying . she was never in the study at all that evening . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ then—— ? ” “ then it would seem that in this charles kent we have the man we are looking for . he came to fernly , can give no account of what he was doing there—— ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i can tell you what he was doing there . he never touched a hair of old ackroyd ’ s head—he never went near the study . he didn ’ t do it , i tell you . ”
christie	ackroyd	she was leaning forward . that iron self-control was broken through at last . terror and desperation were in her face . “ m . poirot ! m. poirot ! oh , do believe me. ” poirot got up and came to her . he patted her reassuringly on the shoulder .
christie	ackroyd	“ but yes—but yes , i will believe . i had to make you speak , you know. ” for an instant suspicion flared up in her . “ is what you said true ? ” “ that charles kent is suspected of the crime ? yes , that is true . you alone can save him , by telling the reason for his being at fernly . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ he came to see me. ” she spoke in a low , hurried voice . “ i went out to meet him—— ” “ in the summer-house , yes , i know. ” “ how do you know ? ” “ mademoiselle , it is the business of hercule poirot to know things . i know that you went out earlier in the evening , that you left a message in the summer-house to say what time you would be there . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ yes , i did . i had heard from him—saying he was coming . i dared not let him come to the house . i wrote to the address he gave me and said i would meet him in the summer-house , and described it to him so that he would be able to find it . then i was afraid he might not wait there patiently , and i ran out and left a piece of paper to say i would be there about ten minutes past nine . i didn ’ t want the servants to see me , so i slipped out through the drawing-room window . as i came back , i met dr. sheppard , and i fancied that he would think it queer . i was out of breath , for i had been running . i had no idea that he was expected to dinner that night . ”
christie	ackroyd	she paused . “ go on , ” said poirot . “ you went out to meet him at ten minutes past nine . what did you say to each other ? ” “ it ’ s difficult . you see—— ” “ mademoiselle , ” said poirot , interrupting her , “ in this matter i must have the whole truth . what you tell us need never go beyond these four walls . dr. sheppard will be discreet , and so shall i . see , i will help you . this charles kent , he is your son , is he not ? ”
christie	ackroyd	she nodded . the color had flamed into her cheeks . “ no one has ever known . it was long ago—long ago—down in kent . i was not married .... ” “ so you took the name of the county as a surname for him . i understand . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i got work . i managed to pay for his board and lodging . i never told him that i was his mother . but he turned out badly , he drank , then took to drugs . i managed to pay his passage out to canada . i didn ’ t hear of him for a year or two . then , somehow or other , he found out that i was his mother . he wrote asking me for money . finally , i heard from him back in this country again . he was coming to see me at fernly , he said . i dared not let him come to the house . i have always been considered so—so very respectable . if any one got an inkling—it would have been all up with my post as housekeeper . so i wrote to him in the way i have just told you . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ and in the morning you came to see dr. sheppard ? ” “ yes . i wondered if something could be done . he was not a bad boy—before he took to drugs. ” “ i see , ” said poirot . “ now let us go on with the story . he came that night to the summer-house ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ yes , he was waiting for me when i got there . he was very rough and abusive . i had brought with me all the money i had , and i gave it to him . we talked a little , and then he went away . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ what time was that ? ” “ it must have been between twenty and twenty-five minutes past nine . it was not yet half-past when i got back to the house. ” “ which way did he go ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ straight out the same way he came , by the path that joined the drive just inside the lodge gates. ” poirot nodded . “ and you , what did you do ? ” “ i went back to the house . major blunt was walking up and down the terrace smoking , so i made a detour to get round to the side door . it was then just on half-past nine , as i tell you . ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot nodded again . he made a note or two in a microscopic pocket-book . “ i think that is all , ” he said thoughtfully . “ ought i—— ” she hesitated . “ ought i to tell all this to inspector raglan ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ it may come to that . but let us not be in a hurry . let us proceed slowly , with due order and method . charles kent is not yet formally charged with murder . circumstances may arise which will render your story unnecessary . ”
christie	ackroyd	miss russell rose . “ thank you very much , m. poirot , ” she said . “ you have been very kind—very kind indeed . you—you do believe me , don ’ t you ? that charles had nothing to do with this wicked murder ! ”
christie	ackroyd	“ there seems no doubt that the man who was talking to mr. ackroyd in the library at nine-thirty could not possibly have been your son . be of good courage , mademoiselle . all will yet be well . ”
christie	ackroyd	miss russell departed . poirot and i were left together . “ so that ’ s that , ” i said . “ every time we come back to ralph paton . how did you manage to spot miss russell as the person charles kent came to meet ? did you notice the resemblance ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i had connected her with the unknown man long before we actually came face to face with him . as soon as we found that quill . the quill suggested dope , and i remembered your account of miss russell ’ s visit to you . then i found the article on cocaine in that morning ’ s paper . it all seemed very clear . she had heard from some one that morning—some one addicted to drugs , she read the article in the paper , and she came to you to ask a few tentative questions . she mentioned cocaine , since the article in question was on cocaine . then , when you seemed too interested , she switched hurriedly to the subject of detective stories and untraceable poisons . i suspected a son or a brother , or some other undesirable male relation . ah ! but i must go . it is the time of the lunch . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ stay and lunch with us , ” i suggested . poirot shook his head . a faint twinkle came into his eye . “ not again to-day . i should not like to force mademoiselle caroline to adopt a vegetarian diet two days in succession . ”
christie	ackroyd	it occurred to me that there was not much which escaped hercule poirot . chapter xxi the paragraph in the paper caroline , of course , had not failed to see miss russell come to the surgery door . i had anticipated this , and had ready an elaborate account of the lady ’ s bad knee . but caroline was not in a cross-questioning mood . her point of view was that she knew what miss russell had really come for and that _i_ didn ’ t .
christie	ackroyd	“ pumping you , james , ” said caroline . “ pumping you in the most shameless manner , i ’ ve not a doubt . it ’ s no good interrupting . i dare say you hadn ’ t the least idea she was doing it even . men _are_ so simple . she knows that you are in m. poirot ’ s confidence , and she wants to find out things . do you know what i think , james ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i couldn ’ t begin to imagine . you think so many extraordinary things. ” “ it ’ s no good being sarcastic . i think miss russell knows more about mr. ackroyd ’ s death than she is prepared to admit . ”
christie	ackroyd	caroline leaned back triumphantly in her chair . “ do you really think so ? ” i said absently . “ you are very dull to-day , james . no animation about you . it ’ s that liver of yours . ”
christie	ackroyd	our conversation then dealt with purely personal matters . the paragraph inspired by poirot duly appeared in our daily paper the next morning . i was in the dark as to its purpose , but its effect on caroline was immense .
christie	ackroyd	she began by stating , most untruly , that she had said as much all along . i raised my eyebrows , but did not argue . caroline , however , must have felt a prick of conscience , for she went on : —
christie	ackroyd	“ i mayn ’ t have actually mentioned liverpool , but i knew he ’ d try to get away to america . that ’ s what crippen did. ” “ without much success , ” i reminded her . “ poor boy , and so they ’ ve caught him . i consider , james , that it ’ s your duty to see that he isn ’ t hung . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ what do you expect me to do ? ” “ why , you ’ re a medical man , aren ’ t you ? you ’ ve known him from a boy upwards . not mentally responsible . that ’ s the line to take , clearly . i read only the other day that they ’ re very happy in broadmoor—it ’ s quite like a high-class club . ”
christie	ackroyd	but caroline ’ s words had reminded me of something . “ i never knew that poirot had an imbecile nephew ? ” i said curiously . “ didn ’ t you ? oh , he told me all about it . poor lad . it ’ s a great grief to all the family . they ’ ve kept him at home so far , but it ’ s getting to such a pitch that they ’ re afraid he ’ ll have to go into some kind of institution . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i suppose you know pretty well everything there is to know about poirot ’ s family by this time , ” i said , exasperated . “ pretty well , ” said caroline complacently . “ it ’ s a great relief to people to be able to tell all their troubles to some one . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ it might be , ” i said , “ if they were ever allowed to do so spontaneously . whether they enjoy having confidences screwed out of them by force is another matter. ” caroline merely looked at me with the air of a christian martyr enjoying martyrdom .
christie	ackroyd	“ you are so self-contained , james , ” she said . “ you hate speaking out , or parting with any information yourself , and you think everybody else must be just like you . i should hope that i never screw confidences out of anybody . for instance , if m. poirot comes in this afternoon , as he said he might do , i shall not dream of asking him who it was arrived at his house early this morning . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ early this morning ? ” i queried . “ very early , ” said caroline . “ before the milk came . i just happened to be looking out of the window—the blind was flapping . it was a man . he came in a closed car , and he was all muffled up . i couldn ’ t get a glimpse of his face . but i will tell you _my_ idea , and you ’ ll see that i ’ m right . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ what ’ s your idea ? ” caroline dropped her voice mysteriously . “ a home office expert , ” she breathed . “ a home office expert , ” i said , amazed . “ my dear caroline ! ” “ mark my words , james , you ’ ll see that i ’ m right . that russell woman was here that morning after your poisons . roger ackroyd might easily have been poisoned in his food that night . ”
christie	ackroyd	i laughed out loud . “ nonsense , ” i cried . “ he was stabbed in the neck . you know that as well as i do. ” “ after death , james , ” said caroline ; “ to make a false clew . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ my good woman , ” i said , “ i examined the body , and i know what i ’ m talking about . that wound wasn ’ t inflicted after death—it was the cause of death , and you need make no mistake about it . ”
christie	ackroyd	caroline merely continued to look omniscient , which so annoyed me that i went on : — “ perhaps you will tell me , caroline , if i have a medical degree or if i have not ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ you have the medical degree , i dare say , james—at least , i mean i know you have . but you ’ ve no imagination whatever. ” “ having endowed you with a treble portion , there was none left over for me , ” i said dryly .
christie	ackroyd	i was amused to notice caroline ’ s maneuvers that afternoon when poirot duly arrived . my sister , without asking a direct question , skirted the subject of the mysterious guest in every way imaginable . by the twinkle in poirot ’ s eyes , i saw that he realized her object . he remained blandly impervious , and blocked her bowling so successfully that she herself was at a loss how to proceed .
christie	ackroyd	having , i suspect , quietly enjoyed the little game , he rose to his feet and suggested a walk . “ it is that i need to reduce the figure a little , ” he explained . “ you will come with me , doctor ? and perhaps later miss caroline will give us some tea . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ delighted , ” said caroline . “ won ’ t your—er—guest come in also ? ” “ you are too kind , ” said poirot . “ but no , my friend reposes himself . soon you must make his acquaintance. ” “ quite an old friend of yours , so somebody told me , ” said caroline , making one last valiant effort .
christie	ackroyd	“ did they ? ” murmured poirot “ well , we must start. ” our tramp took us in the direction of fernly . i had guessed beforehand that it might do so . i was beginning to understand poirot ’ s methods . every little irrelevancy had a bearing upon the whole .
christie	ackroyd	“ i have a commission for you , my friend , ” he said at last . “ to-night , at my house , i desire to have a little conference . you will attend , will you not ? ” “ certainly , ” i said .
christie	ackroyd	“ good . i need also all those in the house—that is to say : mrs. ackroyd , mademoiselle flora , major blunt , m. raymond . i want you to be my ambassador . this little reunion is fixed for nine o ’ clock . you will ask them—yes ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ with pleasure ; but why not ask them yourself ? ” “ because they will then put the questions : why ? what for ? they will demand what my idea is . and , as you know , my friend , i much dislike to have to explain my little ideas until the time comes . ”
christie	ackroyd	i smiled a little . “ my friend hastings , he of whom i told you , used to say of me that i was the human oyster . but he was unjust . of facts , i keep nothing to myself . but to every one his own interpretation of them . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ when do you want me to do this ? ” “ now , if you will . we are close to the house. ” “ aren ’ t you coming in ? ” “ no , me , i will promenade myself in the grounds . i will rejoin you by the lodge gates in a quarter of an hour ’ s time . ”
christie	ackroyd	i nodded , and set off on my task . the only member of the family at home proved to be mrs. ackroyd , who was sipping an early cup of tea . she received me very graciously .
christie	ackroyd	“ so grateful to you , doctor , ” she murmured , “ for clearing up that little matter with m. poirot . but life is one trouble after another . you have heard about flora , of course ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ what exactly ? ” i asked cautiously . “ this new engagement . flora and hector blunt . of course not such a good match as ralph would have been . but after all , happiness comes first . what dear flora needs is an older man—some one steady and reliable , and then hector is really a very distinguished man in his way . you saw the news of ralph ’ s arrest in the paper this morning ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ yes , ” i said , “ i did. ” “ horrible. ” mrs. ackroyd closed her eyes and shuddered . “ geoffrey raymond was in a terrible way . rang up liverpool . but they wouldn ’ t tell him anything at the police station there . in fact , they said they hadn ’ t arrested ralph at all . mr. raymond insists that it ’ s all a mistake—a—what do they call it ? —_canard_ of the newspaper ’ s . i ’ ve forbidden it to be mentioned before the servants . such a terrible disgrace . fancy if flora had actually been married to him . ”
christie	ackroyd	mrs. ackroyd shut her eyes in anguish . i began to wonder how soon i should be able to deliver poirot ’ s invitation . before i had time to speak , mrs. ackroyd was off again .
christie	ackroyd	“ you were here yesterday , weren ’ t you , with that dreadful inspector raglan ? brute of a man—he terrified flora into saying she took that money from poor roger ’ s room . and the matter was so simple , really . the dear child wanted to borrow a few pounds , didn ’ t like to disturb her uncle since he ’ d given strict orders against it , but knowing where he kept his notes she went there and took what she needed . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ is that flora ’ s account of the matter ? ” i asked . “ my dear doctor , you know what girls are nowadays . so easily acted on by suggestion . you , of course , know all about hypnosis and that sort of thing . the inspector shouts at her , says the word ‘ steal ’ over and over again , until the poor child gets an inhibition—or is it a complex ? —i always mix up those two words—and actually thinks herself that she has stolen the money . i saw at once how it was . but i can ’ t be too thankful for the whole misunderstanding in one way—it seems to have brought those two together—hector and flora , i mean . and i assure you that i have been very much worried about flora in the past : why , at one time i actually thought there was going to be some kind of understanding between her and young raymond . just think of it ! ” mrs. ackroyd ’ s voice rose in shrill horror . “ a private secretary—with practically no means of his own . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ it would have been a severe blow to you , ” i said . “ now , mrs. ackroyd , i ’ ve got a message for you from m. hercule poirot. ” “ for me ? ” mrs. ackroyd looked quite alarmed .
christie	ackroyd	i hastened to reassure her , and i explained what poirot wanted . “ certainly , ” said mrs. ackroyd rather doubtfully , “ i suppose we must come if m. poirot says so . but what is it all about ? i like to know beforehand . ”
christie	ackroyd	i assured the lady truthfully that i myself did not know any more than she did . “ very well , ” said mrs. ackroyd at last , rather grudgingly , “ i will tell the others , and we will be there at nine o ’ clock . ”
christie	ackroyd	thereupon i took my leave , and joined poirot at the agreed meeting-place . “ i ’ ve been longer than a quarter of an hour , i ’ m afraid , ” i remarked . “ but once that good lady starts talking it ’ s a matter of the utmost difficulty to get a word in edgeways . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ it is of no matter , ” said poirot . “ me , i have been well amused . this park is magnificent. ” we set off homewards . when we arrived , to our great surprise caroline , who had evidently been watching for us , herself opened the door .
christie	ackroyd	she put her fingers to her lips . her face was full of importance and excitement . “ ursula bourne , ” she said , “ the parlormaid from fernly . she ’ s here ! i ’ ve put her in the dining-room . she ’ s in a terrible way , poor thing . says she must see m. poirot at once . i ’ ve done all i could . taken her a cup of hot tea . it really goes to one ’ s heart to see any one in such a state . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ in the dining-room ? ” asked poirot . “ this way , ” i said , and flung open the door . ursula bourne was sitting by the table . her arms were spread out in front of her , and she had evidently just lifted her head from where it had been buried . her eyes were red with weeping .
christie	ackroyd	“ ursula bourne , ” i murmured . but poirot went past me with outstretched hands . “ no , ” he said , “ that is not quite right , i think . it is not ursula bourne , is it , my child—but ursula paton ? mrs. ralph paton . ”
christie	ackroyd	chapter xxii ursula ’ s story for a moment or two the girl looked mutely at poirot . then , her reserve breaking down completely , she nodded her head once , and burst into an outburst of sobs .
christie	ackroyd	caroline pushed past me , and putting her arm round the girl , patted her on the shoulder . “ there , there , my dear , ” she said soothingly , “ it will be all right . you ’ ll see—everything will be all right . ”
christie	ackroyd	buried under curiosity and scandal-mongering there is a lot of kindness in caroline . for the moment , even the interest of poirot ’ s revelation was lost in the sight of the girl ’ s distress .
christie	ackroyd	presently ursula sat up and wiped her eyes . “ this is very weak and silly of me , ” she said . “ no , no , my child , ” said poirot kindly . “ we can all realize the strain of this last week . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ it must have been a terrible ordeal , ” i said . “ and then to find that you knew , ” continued ursula . “ how did you know ? was it ralph who told you ? ” poirot shook his head .
christie	ackroyd	“ you know what brought me to you to-night , ” went on the girl . “ _this_—— ” she held out a crumpled piece of newspaper , and i recognized the paragraph that poirot had had inserted .
christie	ackroyd	“ it says that ralph has been arrested . so everything is useless . i need not pretend any longer. ” “ newspaper paragraphs are not always true , mademoiselle , ” murmured poirot , having the grace to look ashamed of himself . “ all the same , i think you will do well to make a clean breast of things . the truth is what we need now . ”
christie	ackroyd	the girl hesitated , looking at him doubtfully . “ you do not trust me , ” said poirot gently . “ yet all the same you came here to find me , did you not ? why was that ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ because i don ’ t believe that ralph did it , ” said the girl in a very low voice . “ and i think that you are clever , and will find out the truth . and also—— ”
christie	ackroyd	“ yes ? ” “ i think you are kind. ” poirot nodded his head several times . “ it is very good that—yes , it is very good . listen , i do in verity believe that this husband of yours is innocent—but the affair marches badly . if i am to save him , i must know all there is to know—even if it should seem to make the case against him blacker than before . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ how well you understand , ” said ursula . “ so you will tell me the whole story , will you not ? from the beginning. ” “ you ’ re not going to send _me_ away , i hope , ” said caroline , settling herself comfortably in an arm-chair . “ what i want to know , ” she continued , “ is why this child was masquerading as a parlormaid ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ masquerading ? ” i queried . “ that ’ s what i said . why did you do it , child ? for a wager ? ” “ for a living , ” said ursula dryly . and encouraged , she began the story which i reproduce here in my own words .
christie	ackroyd	ursula bourne , it seemed , was one of a family of seven—impoverished irish gentlefolk . on the death of her father , most of the girls were cast out into the world to earn their own living . ursula ’ s eldest sister was married to captain folliott . it was she whom i had seen that sunday , and the cause of her embarrassment was clear enough now . determined to earn her living and not attracted to the idea of being a nursery governess—the one profession open to an untrained girl , ursula preferred the job of parlormaid . she scorned to label herself a “ lady parlormaid. ” she would be the real thing , her reference being supplied by her sister . at fernly , despite an aloofness which , as has been seen , caused some comment , she was a success at her job—quick , competent , and thorough .
christie	ackroyd	“ i enjoyed the work , ” she explained . “ and i had plenty of time to myself. ” and then came her meeting with ralph paton , and the love affair which culminated in a secret marriage . ralph had persuaded her into that , somewhat against her will . he had declared that his stepfather would not hear of his marrying a penniless girl . better to be married secretly , and break the news to him at some later and more favorable minute .
christie	ackroyd	and so the deed was done , and ursula bourne became ursula paton . ralph had declared that he meant to pay off his debts , find a job , and then , when he was in a position to support her , and independent of his adopted father , they would break the news to him .
christie	ackroyd	but to people like ralph paton , turning over a new leaf is easier in theory than in practice . he hoped that his stepfather , whilst still in ignorance of the marriage , might be persuaded to pay his debts and put him on his feet again . but the revelation of the amount of ralph ’ s liabilities merely enraged roger ackroyd , and he refused to do anything at all . some months passed , and then ralph was bidden once more to fernly . roger ackroyd did not beat about the bush . it was the desire of his heart that ralph should marry flora , and he put the matter plainly before the young man .
christie	ackroyd	and here it was that the innate weakness of ralph paton showed itself . as always , he grasped at the easy , the immediate solution . as far as i could make out , neither flora nor ralph made any pretence of love . it was , on both sides , a business arrangement . roger ackroyd dictated his wishes—they agreed to them . flora accepted a chance of liberty , money , and an enlarged horizon , ralph , of course , was playing a different game . but he was in a very awkward hole financially . he seized at the chance . his debts would be paid . he could start again with a clean sheet . his was not a nature to envisage the future , but i gather that he saw vaguely the engagement with flora being broken off after a decent interval had elapsed . both flora and he stipulated that it should be kept a secret for the present . he was anxious to conceal it from ursula . he felt instinctively that her nature , strong and resolute , with an inherent distaste for duplicity , was not one to welcome such a course .
christie	ackroyd	then came the crucial moment when roger ackroyd , always high-handed , decided to announce the engagement . he said no word of his intention to ralph—only to flora , and flora , apathetic , raised no objection . on ursula , the news fell like a bombshell . summoned by her , ralph came hurriedly down from town . they met in the wood , where part of their conversation was overheard by my sister . ralph implored her to keep silent for a little while longer , ursula was equally determined to have done with concealments . she would tell mr. ackroyd the truth without any further delay . husband and wife parted acrimoniously .
christie	ackroyd	ursula , steadfast in her purpose , sought an interview with roger ackroyd that very afternoon , and revealed the truth to him . their interview was a stormy one—it might have been even more stormy had not roger ackroyd been already obsessed with his own troubles . it was bad enough , however . ackroyd was not the kind of man to forgive the deceit that had been practiced upon him . his rancor was mainly directed to ralph , but ursula came in for her share , since he regarded her as a girl who had deliberately tried to “ entrap ” the adopted son of a very wealthy man . unforgivable things were said on both sides .
christie	ackroyd	that same evening ursula met ralph by appointment in the small summer-house , stealing out from the house by the side door in order to do so . their interview was made up of reproaches on both sides . ralph charged ursula with having irretrievably ruined his prospects by her ill-timed revelation . ursula reproached ralph with his duplicity .
christie	ackroyd	they parted at last . a little over half an hour later came the discovery of roger ackroyd ’ s body . since that night ursula had neither seen nor heard from ralph . as the story unfolded itself , i realized more and more what a damning series of facts it was . alive , ackroyd could hardly have failed to alter his will—i knew him well enough to realize that to do so would be his first thought . his death came in the nick of time for ralph and ursula paton . small wonder the girl had held her tongue , and played her part so consistently .
christie	ackroyd	my meditations were interrupted . it was poirot ’ s voice speaking , and i knew from the gravity of his tone that he , too , was fully alive to the implications of the position .
christie	ackroyd	“ mademoiselle , i must ask you one question , and you must answer it truthfully , for on it everything may hang : what time was it when you parted from captain ralph paton in the summer-house ? now , take a little minute so that your answer may be very exact . ”
christie	ackroyd	the girl gave a half laugh , bitter enough in all conscience . “ do you think i haven ’ t gone over that again and again in my own mind ? it was just half-past nine when i went out to meet him . major blunt was walking up and down the terrace , so i had to go round through the bushes to avoid him . it must have been about twenty-seven minutes to ten when i reached the summer-house . ralph was waiting for me . i was with him ten minutes—not longer , for it was just a quarter to ten when i got back to the house . ”
christie	ackroyd	i saw now the insistence of her question the other day . if only ackroyd could have been proved to have been killed before a quarter to ten , and not after .
christie	ackroyd	i saw the reflection of that thought in poirot ’ s next question . “ who left the summer-house first ? ” “ i did. ” “ leaving ralph paton in the summer-house ? ” “ yes—but you don ’ t think—— ” “ mademoiselle , it is of no importance what i think . what did you do when you got back to the house ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i went up to my room. ” “ and stayed there until when ? ” “ until about ten o ’ clock. ” “ is there any one who can prove that ? ” “ prove ? that i was in my room , you mean ? oh ! no . but surely—oh ! i see , they might think—they might think—— ”
christie	ackroyd	i saw the dawning horror in her eyes . poirot finished the sentence for her . “ that it was _you_ who entered by the window and stabbed mr. ackroyd as he sat in his chair ? yes , they might think just that . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ nobody but a fool would think any such thing , ” said caroline indignantly . she patted ursula on the shoulder . the girl had her face hidden in her hands . “ horrible , ” she was murmuring . “ horrible . ”
christie	ackroyd	caroline gave her a friendly shake . “ don ’ t worry , my dear , ” she said . “ m . poirot doesn ’ t think that really . as for that husband of yours , i don ’ t think much of him , and i tell you so candidly . running away and leaving you to face the music . ”
christie	ackroyd	but ursula shook her head energetically . “ oh , no , ” she cried . “ it wasn ’ t like that at all . ralph would not run away on his own account . i see now . if he heard of his stepfather ’ s murder , he might think himself that i had done it . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ he wouldn ’ t think any such thing , ” said caroline . “ i was so cruel to him that night—so hard and bitter . i wouldn ’ t listen to what he was trying to say—wouldn ’ t believe that he really cared . i just stood there telling him what i thought of him , and saying the coldest , cruelest things that came into my mind—trying my best to hurt him . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ do him no harm , ” said caroline . “ never worry about what you say to a man . they ’ re so conceited that they never believe you mean it if it ’ s unflattering. ” ursula went on , nervously twisting and untwisting her hands .
christie	ackroyd	“ when the murder was discovered and he didn ’ t come forward , i was terribly upset . just for a moment i wondered—but then i knew he couldn ’ t—he couldn ’ t .... but i wished he would come forward and say openly that he ’ d had nothing to do with it . i knew that he was very fond of dr. sheppard , and i fancied that perhaps dr. sheppard might know where he was hiding . ”
christie	ackroyd	she turned to me . “ that ’ s why i said what i did to you that day . i thought , if you knew where he was , you might pass on the message to him . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i ? ” i exclaimed . “ why should james know where he was ? ” demanded caroline sharply . “ it was very unlikely , i know , ” admitted ursula , “ but ralph had often spoken of dr. sheppard , and i knew that he would be likely to consider him as his best friend in king ’ s abbot . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ my dear child , ” i said , “ i have not the least idea where ralph paton is at the present moment. ” “ that is true enough , ” said poirot . “ but—— ” ursula held out the newspaper cutting in a puzzled fashion .
christie	ackroyd	“ ah ! that , ” said poirot , slightly embarrassed ; “ a _bagatelle_ , mademoiselle . a _rien du tout_ . not for a moment do i believe that ralph paton has been arrested. ” “ but then—— ” began the girl slowly .
christie	ackroyd	poirot went on quickly : — “ there is one thing i should like to know—did captain paton wear shoes or boots that night ? ” ursula shook her head . “ i can ’ t remember. ” “ a pity ! but how should you ? now , madame , ” he smiled at her , his head on one side , his forefinger wagging eloquently , “ no questions . and do not torment yourself . be of good courage , and place your faith in hercule poirot . ”
christie	ackroyd	chapter xxiii poirot ’ s little reunion “ and now , ” said caroline , rising , “ that child is coming upstairs to lie down . don ’ t you worry , my dear . m. poirot will do everything he can for you—be sure of that . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i ought to go back to fernly , ” said ursula uncertainly . but caroline silenced her protests with a firm hand . “ nonsense . you ’ re in my hands for the time being . you ’ ll stay here for the present , anyway—eh , m. poirot ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ it will be the best plan , ” agreed the little belgian . “ this evening i shall want mademoiselle—i beg her pardon , madame—to attend my little reunion . nine o ’ clock at my house . it is most necessary that she should be there . ”
christie	ackroyd	caroline nodded , and went with ursula out of the room . the door shut behind them . poirot dropped down into a chair again . “ so far , so good , ” he said . “ things are straightening themselves out . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ they ’ re getting to look blacker and blacker against ralph paton , ” i observed gloomily . poirot nodded . “ yes , that is so . but it was to be expected , was it not ? ” i looked at him , slightly puzzled by the remark . he was leaning back in the chair , his eyes half closed , the tips of his fingers just touching each other . suddenly he sighed and shook his head .
christie	ackroyd	“ what is it ? ” i asked . “ it is that there are moments when a great longing for my friend hastings comes over me . that is the friend of whom i spoke to you—the one who resides now in the argentine . always , when i have had a big case , he has been by my side . and he has helped me—yes , often he has helped me . for he had a knack , that one , of stumbling over the truth unawares—without noticing it himself , _bien entendu_ . at times he has said something particularly foolish , and behold that foolish remark has revealed the truth to me ! and then , too , it was his practice to keep a written record of the cases that proved interesting . ”
christie	ackroyd	i gave a slight embarrassed cough . “ as far as that goes , ” i began , and then stopped . poirot sat upright in his chair . his eyes sparkled . “ but yes ? what is it that you would say ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ well , as a matter of fact , i ’ ve read some of captain hastings ’ s narratives , and i thought , why not try my hand at something of the same kind ? seemed a pity not to—unique opportunity—probably the only time i ’ ll be mixed up with anything of this kind . ”
christie	ackroyd	i felt myself getting hotter and hotter , and more and more incoherent , as i floundered through the above speech . poirot sprang from his chair . i had a moment ’ s terror that he was going to embrace me french fashion , but mercifully he refrained .
christie	ackroyd	“ but this is magnificent—you have then written down your impressions of the case as you went along ? ” i nodded . “ _epatant ! _ ” cried poirot . “ let me see them—this instant. ” i was not quite prepared for such a sudden demand . i racked my brains to remember certain details .
christie	ackroyd	“ i hope you won ’ t mind , ” i stammered . “ i may have been a little—er—_personal_ now and then. ” “ oh ! i comprehend perfectly ; you have referred to me as comic—as , perhaps , ridiculous now and then ? it matters not at all . hastings , he also was not always polite . me , i have the mind above such trivialities . ”
christie	ackroyd	still somewhat doubtful , i rummaged in the drawers of my desk and produced an untidy pile of manuscript which i handed over to him . with an eye on possible publication in the future , i had divided the work into chapters , and the night before i had brought it up to date with an account of miss russell ’ s visit . poirot had therefore twenty chapters .
christie	ackroyd	i left him with them . i was obliged to go out to a case at some distance away , and it was past eight o ’ clock when i got back , to be greeted with a plate of hot dinner on a tray , and the announcement that poirot and my sister had supped together at half-past seven , and that the former had then gone to my workshop to finish his reading of the manuscript .
christie	ackroyd	“ i hope , james , ” said my sister , “ that you ’ ve been careful in what you say about me in it ? ” my jaw dropped . i had not been careful at all . “ not that it matters very much , ” said caroline , reading my expression correctly . “ m . poirot will know what to think . he understands me much better than you do . ”
christie	ackroyd	i went into the workshop . poirot was sitting by the window . the manuscript lay neatly piled on a chair beside him . he laid his hand on it and spoke . “ _eh bien_ , ” he said , “ i congratulate you—on your modesty ! ”
christie	ackroyd	“ oh ! ” i said , rather taken aback . “ and on your reticence , ” he added . i said “ oh ! ” again . “ not so did hastings write , ” continued my friend . “ on every page , many , many times was the word ‘ i. ’ what _he_ thought—what _he_ did . but you—you have kept your personality in the background ; only once or twice does it obtrude—in scenes of home life , shall we say ? ”
christie	ackroyd	i blushed a little before the twinkle in his eye . “ what do you really think of the stuff ? ” i asked nervously . “ you want my candid opinion ? ” “ yes. ” poirot laid his jesting manner aside .
christie	ackroyd	“ a very meticulous and accurate account , ” he said kindly . “ you have recorded all the facts faithfully and exactly—though you have shown yourself becomingly reticent as to your own share in them . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ and it has helped you ? ” “ yes . i may say that it has helped me considerably . come , we must go over to my house and set the stage for my little performance . ”
christie	ackroyd	caroline was in the hall . i think she hoped that she might be invited to accompany us . poirot dealt with the situation tactfully . “ i should much like to have had you present , mademoiselle , ” he said regretfully , “ but at this juncture it would not be wise . see you , all these people to-night are suspects . amongst them , i shall find the person who killed mr. ackroyd . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ you really believe that ? ” i said incredulously . “ i see that you do not , ” said poirot dryly . “ not yet do you appreciate hercule poirot at his true worth. ” at that minute ursula came down the staircase .
christie	ackroyd	“ you are ready , my child ? ” said poirot . “ that is good . we will go to my house together . mademoiselle caroline , believe me , i do everything possible to render you service . good-evening . ”
christie	ackroyd	we went out , leaving caroline , rather like a dog who has been refused a walk , standing on the front door step gazing after us . the sitting-room at the larches had been got ready . on the table were various _sirops_ and glasses . also a plate of biscuits . several chairs had been brought in from the other room .
christie	ackroyd	poirot ran to and fro rearranging things . pulling out a chair here , altering the position of a lamp there , occasionally stooping to straighten one of the mats that covered the floor . he was specially fussy over the lighting . the lamps were arranged in such a way as to throw a clear light on the side of the room where the chairs were grouped , at the same time leaving the other end of the room , where i presumed poirot himself would sit , in a dim twilight .
christie	ackroyd	ursula and i watched him . presently a bell was heard . “ they arrive , ” said poirot . “ good , all is in readiness. ” the door opened and the party from fernly filed in . poirot went forward and greeted mrs. ackroyd and flora .
christie	ackroyd	“ it is most good of you to come , ” he said . “ and major blunt and mr. raymond. ” the secretary was debonair as ever . “ what ’ s the great idea ? ” he said , laughing . “ some scientific machine ? do we have bands round our wrists which register guilty heart-beats ? there is such an invention , isn ’ t there ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i have read of it , yes , ” admitted poirot . “ but me , i am old-fashioned . i use the old methods . i work only with the little gray cells . now let us begin—but first i have an announcement to make to you all . ”
christie	ackroyd	he took ursula ’ s hand and drew her forward . “ this lady is mrs. ralph paton . she was married to captain paton last march. ” a little shriek burst from mrs. ackroyd . “ ralph ! married ! last march ! oh ! but it ’ s absurd . how could he be ? ”
christie	ackroyd	she stared at ursula as though she had never seen her before . “ married to bourne ? ” she said . “ really , m. poirot , i don ’ t believe you. ” ursula flushed and began to speak , but flora forestalled her .
christie	ackroyd	going quickly to the other girl ’ s side , she passed her hand through her arm . “ you must not mind our being surprised , ” she said . “ you see , we had no idea of such a thing . you and ralph have kept your secret very well . i am—very glad about it . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ you are very kind , miss ackroyd , ” said ursula in a low voice , “ and you have every right to be exceedingly angry . ralph behaved very badly—especially to you. ” “ you needn ’ t worry about that , ” said flora , giving her arm a consoling little pat . “ ralph was in a corner and took the only way out . i should probably have done the same in his place . i do think he might have trusted me with the secret , though . i wouldn ’ t have let him down . ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot rapped gently on a table and cleared his throat significantly . “ the board meeting ’ s going to begin , ” said flora . “ m . poirot hints that we mustn ’ t talk . but just tell me one thing . where is ralph ? you must know if any one does . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ but i don ’ t , ” cried ursula , almost in a wail . “ that ’ s just it , i don ’ t. ” “ isn ’ t he detained at liverpool ? ” asked raymond . “ it said so in the paper. ” “ he is not at liverpool , ” said poirot shortly .
christie	ackroyd	“ in fact , ” i remarked , “ no one knows where he is. ” “ excepting hercule poirot , eh ? ” said raymond . poirot replied seriously to the other ’ s banter . “ me , i know everything . remember that. ” geoffrey raymond lifted his eyebrows .
christie	ackroyd	“ everything ? ” he whistled . “ whew ! that ’ s a tall order. ” “ do you mean to say you can really guess where ralph paton is hiding ? ” i asked incredulously . “ you call it guessing . i call it knowing , my friend . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ in cranchester ? ” i hazarded . “ no , ” replied poirot gravely , “ not in cranchester. ” he said no more , but at a gesture from him the assembled party took their seats . as they did so , the door opened once more and two other people came in and sat down near the door . they were parker and the housekeeper .
christie	ackroyd	“ the number is complete , ” said poirot . “ every one is here. ” there was a ring of satisfaction in his tone . and with the sound of it i saw a ripple of something like uneasiness pass over all those faces grouped at the other end of the room . there was a suggestion in all this as of a trap—a trap that had closed .
christie	ackroyd	poirot read from a list in an important manner . “ mrs . ackroyd , miss flora ackroyd , major blunt , mr. geoffrey raymond , mrs. ralph paton , john parker , elizabeth russell. ” he laid the paper down on the table .
christie	ackroyd	“ what ’ s the meaning of all this ? ” began raymond . “ the list i have just read , ” said poirot , “ is a list of suspected persons . every one of you present had the opportunity to kill mr. ackroyd—— ”
christie	ackroyd	with a cry mrs. ackroyd sprang up , her throat working . “ i don ’ t like it , ” she wailed . “ i don ’ t like it . i would much prefer to go home. ” “ you can not go home , madame , ” said poirot sternly , “ until you have heard what i have to say . ”
christie	ackroyd	he paused a moment , then cleared his throat . “ i will start at the beginning . when miss ackroyd asked me to investigate the case , i went up to fernly park with the good dr. sheppard . i walked with him along the terrace , where i was shown the footprints on the window-sill . from there inspector raglan took me along the path which leads to the drive . my eye was caught by a little summer-house , and i searched it thoroughly . i found two things—a scrap of starched cambric and an empty goose quill . the scrap of cambric immediately suggested to me a maid ’ s apron . when inspector raglan showed me his list of the people in the house , i noticed at once that one of the maids—ursula bourne , the parlormaid—had no real alibi . according to her own story , she was in her bedroom from nine-thirty until ten . but supposing that instead she was in the summer-house ? if so , she must have gone there to meet some one . now we know from dr. sheppard that some one from outside _did_ come to the house that night—the stranger whom he met just by the gate . at a first glance it would seem that our problem was solved , and that the stranger went to the summer-house to meet ursula bourne . it was fairly certain that he _did_ go to the summer-house because of the goose quill . that suggested at once to my mind a taker of drugs—and one who had acquired the habit on the other side of the atlantic where sniffing ‘ snow ’ is more common than in this country . the man whom dr. sheppard met had an american accent , which fitted in with that supposition .
christie	ackroyd	“ but i was held up by one point . _the times did not fit._ ursula bourne could certainly not have gone to the summer-house before nine-thirty , whereas the man must have got there by a few minutes past nine . i could , of course , assume that he waited there for half an hour . the only alternative supposition was that there had been two separate meetings in the summer-house that night . _eh bien_ , as soon as i went into that alternative i found several significant facts . i discovered that miss russell , the housekeeper , had visited dr. sheppard that morning , and had displayed a good deal of interest in cures for victims of the drug habit . taking that in conjunction with the goose quill , i assumed that the man in question came to fernly to meet the housekeeper , and not ursula bourne . who , then , did ursula bourne come to the rendezvous to meet ? i was not long in doubt . first i found a ring—a wedding ring—with ‘ from r. ’ and a date inside it . then i learnt that ralph paton had been seen coming up the path which led to the summer-house at twenty-five minutes past nine , and i also heard of a certain conversation which had taken place in the wood near the village that very afternoon—a conversation between ralph paton and some unknown girl . so i had my facts succeeding each other in a neat and orderly manner . a secret marriage , an engagement announced on the day of the tragedy , the stormy interview in the wood , and the meeting arranged for the summer-house that night .
christie	ackroyd	“ incidentally this proved to me one thing , that both ralph paton and ursula bourne ( or paton ) had the strongest motives for wishing mr. ackroyd out of the way . and it also made one other point unexpectedly clear . it could not have been ralph paton who was with mr. ackroyd in the study at nine-thirty .
christie	ackroyd	“ so we come to another and most interesting aspect of the crime . who was it in the room with mr. ackroyd at nine-thirty ? not ralph paton , who was in the summer-house with his wife . not charles kent , who had already left . who , then ? i posed my cleverest—my most audacious question : _was any one with him ? _ ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot leaned forward and shot the last words triumphantly at us , drawing back afterwards with the air of one who has made a decided hit . raymond , however , did not seem impressed , and lodged a mild protest .
christie	ackroyd	“ i don ’ t know if you ’ re trying to make me out a liar , m. poirot , but the matter does not rest on my evidence alone—except perhaps as to the exact words used . remember , major blunt also heard mr. ackroyd talking to some one . he was on the terrace outside , and couldn ’ t catch the words clearly , but he distinctly heard the voices . ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot nodded . “ i have not forgotten , ” he said quietly . “ but major blunt was under the impression that it was _you_ to whom mr. ackroyd was speaking. ” for a moment raymond seemed taken aback . then he recovered himself .
christie	ackroyd	“ blunt knows now that he was mistaken , ” he said . “ exactly , ” agreed the other man . “ yet there must have been some reason for his thinking so , ” mused poirot . “ oh ! no , ” he held up his hand in protest , “ i know the reason you will give—but it is not enough . we must seek elsewhere . i will put it this way . from the beginning of the case i have been struck by one thing—the nature of those words which mr. raymond overheard . it has been amazing to me that no one has commented on them—has seen anything odd about them . ”
christie	ackroyd	he paused a minute , and then quoted softly : — “ ... _the calls on my purse have been so frequent of late that i fear it is impossible for me to accede to your request._ does nothing strike you as odd about that ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i don ’ t think so , ” said raymond . “ he has frequently dictated letters to me , using almost exactly those same words. ” “ exactly , ” cried poirot . “ that is what i seek to arrive at . would any man use such a phrase in _talking_ to another ? impossible that that should be part of a real conversation . now , if he had been dictating a letter—— ”
christie	ackroyd	“ you mean he was reading a letter aloud , ” said raymond slowly . “ even so , he must have been reading to some one. ” “ but why ? we have no evidence that there was any one else in the room . no other voice but mr. ackroyd ’ s was heard , remember . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ surely a man wouldn ’ t read letters of that type aloud to himself—not unless he was—well—going balmy. ” “ you have all forgotten one thing , ” said poirot softly : “ the stranger who called at the house the preceding wednesday . ”
christie	ackroyd	they all stared at him . “ but yes , ” said poirot , nodding encouragingly , “ on wednesday . the young man was not of himself important . but the firm he represented interested me very much . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ the dictaphone company , ” gasped raymond . “ i see it now . a dictaphone . that ’ s what you think ? ” poirot nodded . “ mr . ackroyd had promised to invest in a dictaphone , you remember . me , i had the curiosity to inquire of the company in question . their reply is that mr. ackroyd _did_ purchase a dictaphone from their representative . why he concealed the matter from you , i do not know . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ he must have meant to surprise me with it , ” murmured raymond . “ he had quite a childish love of surprising people . meant to keep it up his sleeve for a day or so . probably was playing with it like a new toy . yes , it fits in . you ’ re quite right—no one would use quite those words in casual conversation . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ it explains , too , ” said poirot , “ why major blunt thought it was you who were in the study . such scraps as came to him were fragments of dictation , and so his subconscious mind deduced that you were with him . his conscious mind was occupied with something quite different—the white figure he had caught a glimpse of . he fancied it was miss ackroyd . really , of course , it was ursula bourne ’ s white apron he saw as she was stealing down to the summer-house . ”
christie	ackroyd	raymond had recovered from his first surprise . “ all the same , ” he remarked , “ this discovery of yours , brilliant though it is ( i ’ m quite sure i should never have thought of it ) , leaves the essential position unchanged . mr. ackroyd was alive at nine-thirty , since he was speaking into the dictaphone . it seems clear that the man charles kent was really off the premises by then . as to ralph paton—— ? ”
christie	ackroyd	he hesitated , glancing at ursula . her color flared up , but she answered steadily enough . “ ralph and i parted just before a quarter to ten . he never went near the house , i am sure of that . he had no intention of doing so . the last thing on earth he wanted was to face his stepfather . he would have funked it badly . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ it isn ’ t that i doubt your story for a moment , ” explained raymond . “ i ’ ve always been quite sure captain paton was innocent . but one has to think of a court of law—and the questions that would be asked . he is in a most unfortunate position , but if he were to come forward—— ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot interrupted . “ that is your advice , yes ? that he should come forward ? ” “ certainly . if you know where he is—— ” “ i perceive that you do not believe that i do know . and yet i have told you just now that i know everything . the truth of the telephone call , of the footprints on the window-sill , of the hiding-place of ralph paton—— ”
christie	ackroyd	“ where is he ? ” said blunt sharply . “ not very far away , ” said poirot , smiling . “ in cranchester ? ” i asked . poirot turned towards me . “ always you ask me that . the idea of cranchester it is with you an _idée fixe_ . no , he is not in cranchester . he is—_there_ ! ”
christie	ackroyd	he pointed a dramatic forefinger . every one ’ s head turned . ralph paton was standing in the doorway . chapter xxiv ralph paton ’ s story it was a very uncomfortable minute for _me_ . i hardly took in what happened next , but there were exclamations and cries of surprise ! when i was sufficiently master of myself to be able to realize what was going on , ralph paton was standing by his wife , her hand in his , and he was smiling across the room at me .
christie	ackroyd	poirot , too , was smiling , and at the same time shaking an eloquent finger at me . “ have i not told you at least thirty-six times that it is useless to conceal things from hercule poirot ? ” he demanded . “ that in such a case he finds out ? ”
christie	ackroyd	he turned to the others . “ one day , you remember , we held a little séance about a table—just the six of us . i accused the other five persons present of concealing something from me . four of them gave up their secret . dr. sheppard did not give up his . but all along i have had my suspicions . dr. sheppard went to the three boars that night hoping to find ralph . he did not find him there ; but supposing , i said to myself , that he met him in the street on his way home ? dr. sheppard was a friend of captain paton ’ s , and he had come straight from the scene of the crime . he must know that things looked very black against him . perhaps he knew more than the general public did—— ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i did , ” i said ruefully . “ i suppose i might as well make a clean breast of things now . i went to see ralph that afternoon . at first he refused to take me into his confidence , but later he told me about his marriage , and the hole he was in . as soon as the murder was discovered , i realized that once the facts were known , suspicion could not fail to attach to ralph—or , if not to him , to the girl he loved . that night i put the facts plainly before him . the thought of having possibly to give evidence which might incriminate his wife made him resolve at all costs to—to—— ”
christie	ackroyd	i hesitated , and ralph filled up the gap . “ to do a bunk , ” he said graphically . “ you see , ursula left me to go back to the house . i thought it possible that she might have attempted to have another interview with my stepfather . he had already been very rude to her that afternoon . it occurred to me that he might have so insulted her—in such an unforgivable manner—that without knowing what she was doing—— ”
christie	ackroyd	he stopped . ursula released her hand from his , and stepped back . “ you thought that , ralph ! you actually thought that i might have done it ? ” “ let us get back to the culpable conduct of dr. sheppard , ” said poirot dryly . “ dr . sheppard consented to do what he could to help him . he was successful in hiding captain paton from the police . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ where ? ” asked raymond . “ in his own house ? ” “ ah , no , indeed , ” said poirot . “ you should ask yourself the question that i did . if the good doctor is concealing the young man , what place would he choose ? it must necessarily be somewhere near at hand . i think of cranchester . a hotel ? no . lodgings ? even more emphatically , no . where , then ? ah ! i have it . a nursing home . a home for the mentally unfit . i test my theory . i invent a nephew with mental trouble . i consult mademoiselle sheppard as to suitable homes . she gives me the names of two near cranchester to which her brother has sent patients . i make inquiries . yes , at one of them a patient was brought there by the doctor himself early on saturday morning . that patient , though known by another name , i had no difficulty in identifying as captain paton . after certain necessary formalities , i was allowed to bring him away . he arrived at my house in the early hours of yesterday morning . ”
christie	ackroyd	i looked at him ruefully . “ caroline ’ s home office expert , ” i murmured . “ and to think i never guessed ! ” “ you see now why i drew attention to the reticence of your manuscript , ” murmured poirot . “ it was strictly truthful as far as it went—but it did not go very far , eh , my friend ? ”
christie	ackroyd	i was too abashed to argue . “ dr . sheppard has been very loyal , ” said ralph . “ he has stood by me through thick and thin . he did what he thought was the best . i see now , from what m. poirot has told me , that it was not really the best . i should have come forward and faced the music . you see , in the home , we never saw a newspaper . i knew nothing of what was going on . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ dr . sheppard has been a model of discretion , ” said poirot dryly . “ but me , i discover all the little secrets . it is my business. ” “ now we can have your story of what happened that night , ” said raymond impatiently .
christie	ackroyd	“ you know it already , ” said ralph . “ there ’ s very little for me to add . i left the summer-house about nine-forty-five , and tramped about the lanes , trying to make up my mind as to what to do next—what line to take . i ’ m bound to admit that i ’ ve not the shadow of an alibi , but i give you my solemn word that i never went to the study , that i never saw my stepfather alive—or dead . whatever the world thinks , i ’ d like all of you to believe me . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ no alibi , ” murmured raymond . “ that ’ s bad . i believe you , of course , but—it ’ s a bad business. ” “ it makes things very simple , though , ” said poirot , in a cheerful voice . “ very simple indeed . ”
christie	ackroyd	we all stared at him . “ you see what i mean ? no ? just this—to save captain paton the real criminal must confess. ” he beamed round at us all . “ but yes—i mean what i say . see now , i did not invite inspector raglan to be present . that was for a reason . i did not want to tell him all that i knew—at least i did not want to tell him to-night . ”
christie	ackroyd	he leaned forward , and suddenly his voice and his whole personality changed . he suddenly became dangerous . “ i who speak to you—i know the murderer of mr. ackroyd is in this room now . it is to the murderer i speak . _to-morrow the truth goes to inspector raglan._ you understand ? ”
christie	ackroyd	there was a tense silence . into the midst of it came the old breton woman with a telegram on a salver . poirot tore it open . blunt ’ s voice rose abrupt and resonant .
christie	ackroyd	“ the murderer is amongst us , you say ? you know—which ? ” poirot had read the message . he crumpled it up in his hand . “ i know—now. ” he tapped the crumpled ball of paper .
christie	ackroyd	“ what is that ? ” said raymond sharply . “ a wireless message—from a steamer now on her way to the united states. ” there was a dead silence . poirot rose to his feet bowing .
christie	ackroyd	“ messieurs et mesdames , this reunion of mine is at an end . remember—_the truth goes to inspector raglan in the morning_. ” chapter xxv the whole truth a slight gesture from poirot enjoined me to stay behind the rest . i obeyed , going over to the fire and thoughtfully stirring the big logs on it with the toe of my boot .
christie	ackroyd	i was puzzled . for the first time i was absolutely at sea as to poirot ’ s meaning . for a moment i was inclined to think that the scene i had just witnessed was a gigantic piece of bombast—that he had been what he called “ playing the comedy ” with a view to making himself interesting and important . but , in spite of myself , i was forced to believe in an underlying reality . there had been real menace in his words—a certain indisputable sincerity . but i still believed him to be on entirely the wrong tack .
christie	ackroyd	when the door shut behind the last of the party he came over to the fire . “ well , my friend , ” he said quietly , “ and what do you think of it all ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i don ’ t know what to think , ” i said frankly . “ what was the point ? why not go straight to inspector raglan with the truth instead of giving the guilty person this elaborate warning ? ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot sat down and drew out his case of tiny russian cigarettes . he smoked for a minute or two in silence . then : — “ use your little gray cells , ” he said . “ there is always a reason behind my actions . ”
christie	ackroyd	i hesitated for a moment , and then i said slowly : “ the first one that occurs to me is that you yourself do not know who the guilty person is , but that you are sure that he is to be found amongst the people here to-night . therefore your words were intended to force a confession from the unknown murderer ? ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot nodded approvingly . “ a clever idea , but not the truth. ” “ i thought , perhaps , that by making him believe you knew , you might force him out into the open—not necessarily by confession . he might try to silence you as he formerly silenced mr. ackroyd—before you could act to-morrow morning . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ a trap with myself as the bait ! _merci , mon ami_ , but i am not sufficiently heroic for that. ” “ then i fail to understand you . surely you are running the risk of letting the murderer escape by thus putting him on his guard ? ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot shook his head . “ he can not escape , ” he said gravely . “ there is only one way out—and that way does not lead to freedom. ” “ you really believe that one of those people here to-night committed the murder ? ” i asked incredulously .
christie	ackroyd	“ yes , my friend. ” “ which one ? ” there was a silence for some minutes . then poirot tossed the stump of his cigarette into the grate and began to speak in a quiet , reflective tone .
christie	ackroyd	“ i will take you the way that i have traveled myself . step by step you shall accompany me , and see for yourself that all the facts point indisputably to one person . now , to begin with , there were two facts and one little discrepancy in time which especially attracted my attention . the first fact was the telephone call . if ralph paton were indeed the murderer , the telephone call became meaningless and absurd . therefore , i said to myself , ralph paton is not the murderer .
christie	ackroyd	“ i satisfied myself that the call could not have been sent by any one in the house , yet i was convinced that it was amongst those present on the fatal evening that i had to look for my criminal . therefore i concluded that the telephone call must have been sent by an accomplice . i was not quite pleased with that deduction , but i let it stand for the minute .
christie	ackroyd	“ i next examined the _motive_ for the call . that was difficult . i could only get at it by judging its _result_ . which was—that the murder was discovered that night instead of—in all probability—the following morning . you agree with that ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ ye-es , ” i admitted . “ yes . as you say , mr. ackroyd , having given orders that he was not to be disturbed , nobody would have been likely to go to the study that night . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ _très bien._ the affair marches , does it not ? but matters were still obscure . what was the advantage of having the crime discovered that night in preference to the following morning ? the only idea i could get hold of was that the murderer , knowing the crime was to be discovered at a certain time , could make sure of being present when the door was broken in—or at any rate immediately afterwards . and now we come to the second fact—the chair pulled out from the wall . inspector raglan dismissed that as of no importance . i , on the contrary , have always regarded it as of supreme importance .
christie	ackroyd	“ in your manuscript you have drawn a neat little plan of the study . if you had it with you this minute you would see that—the chair being drawn out in the position indicated by parker—it would stand in a direct line between the door and the window . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ the window ! ” i said quickly . “ you , too , have my first idea . i imagined that the chair was drawn out so that something connected with the window should not be seen by any one entering through the door . but i soon abandoned that supposition , for though the chair was a grandfather with a high back , it obscured very little of the window—only the part between the sash and the ground . no , _mon ami_—but remember that just in front of the window there stood a table with books and magazines upon it . now that table _was_ completely hidden by the drawn-out chair—and immediately i had my first shadowy suspicion of the truth .
christie	ackroyd	“ supposing that there had been something on that table not intended to be seen ? something placed there by the murderer ? as yet i had no inkling of what that something might be . but i knew certain very interesting facts about it . for instance , it was something that the murderer had not been able to take away with him at the time that he committed the crime . at the same time it was vital that it should be removed as soon as possible after the crime had been discovered . and so—the telephone message , and the opportunity for the murderer to be on the spot when the body was discovered .
christie	ackroyd	“ now four people were on the scene before the police arrived . yourself , parker , major blunt , and mr. raymond . parker i eliminated at once , since at whatever time the crime was discovered , he was the one person certain to be on the spot . also it was he who told me of the pulled-out chair . parker , then , was cleared ( of the murder , that is . i still thought it possible that he had been blackmailing mrs. ferrars ) . raymond and blunt , however , remained under suspicion since , if the crime had been discovered in the early hours of the morning , it was quite possible that they might have arrived on the scene too late to prevent the object on the round table being discovered .
christie	ackroyd	“ now what was that object ? you heard my arguments to-night in reference to the scrap of conversation overheard ? as soon as i learned that a representative of a dictaphone company had called , the idea of a dictaphone took root in my mind . you heard what i said in this room not half an hour ago ? they all agreed with my theory—but one vital fact seems to have escaped them . granted that a dictaphone was being used by mr. ackroyd that night—why was no dictaphone found ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i never thought of that , ” i said . “ we know that a dictaphone was supplied to mr. ackroyd . but no dictaphone has been found amongst his effects . so , if something was taken from that table—why should not that something be the dictaphone ? but there were certain difficulties in the way . the attention of every one was , of course , focused on the murdered man . i think any one could have gone to the table unnoticed by the other people in the room . but a dictaphone has a certain bulk—it can not be slipped casually into a pocket . there must have been a receptacle of some kind capable of holding it .
christie	ackroyd	“ you see where i am arriving ? the figure of the murderer is taking shape . a person who was on the scene straightway , but who might not have been if the crime had been discovered the following morning . a person carrying a receptacle into which the dictaphone might be fitted—— ”
christie	ackroyd	i interrupted . “ but why remove the dictaphone ? what was the point ? ” “ you are like mr. raymond . you take it for granted that what was heard at nine-thirty was mr. ackroyd ’ s voice speaking into a dictaphone . but consider this useful invention for a little minute . you dictate into it , do you not ? and at some later time a secretary or a typist turns it on , and the voice speaks again . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ you mean—— ” i gasped . poirot nodded . “ yes , i mean that . _at nine-thirty mr. ackroyd was already dead._ it was the dictaphone speaking—not the man. ” “ and the murderer switched it on . then he must have been in the room at that minute ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ possibly . but we must not exclude the likelihood of some mechanical device having been applied—something after the nature of a time lock , or even of a simple alarm clock . but in that case we must add two qualifications to our imaginary portrait of the murderer . it must be some one who knew of mr. ackroyd ’ s purchase of the dictaphone and also some one with the necessary mechanical knowledge .
christie	ackroyd	“ i had got thus far in my own mind when we came to the footprints on the window ledge . here there were three conclusions open to me . ( 1 ) they might really have been made by ralph paton . he had been at fernly that night , and might have climbed into the study and found his uncle dead there . that was one hypothesis . ( 2 ) there was the possibility that the footmarks might have been made by somebody else who happened to have the same kind of studs in his shoes . but the inmates of the house had shoes soled with crepe rubber , and i declined to believe in the coincidence of some one from outside having the same kind of shoes as ralph paton wore . charles kent , as we know from the barmaid of the dog and whistle , had on a pair of boots ‘ clean dropping off him. ’ ( 3 ) those prints were made by some one deliberately trying to throw suspicion on ralph paton . to test this last conclusion , it was necessary to ascertain certain facts . one pair of ralph ’ s shoes had been obtained from the three boars by the police . neither ralph nor any one else could have worn them that evening , since they were downstairs being cleaned . according to the police theory , ralph was wearing another pair of the same kind , and i found out that it was true that he had two pairs . now for my theory to be proved correct it was necessary for the murderer to have worn ralph ’ s shoes that evening—in which case ralph must have been wearing yet a _third_ pair of footwear of some kind . i could hardly suppose that he would bring three pairs of shoes all alike—the third pair of footwear were more likely to be boots . i got your sister to make inquiries on this point—laying some stress on the color , in order—i admit it frankly—to obscure the real reason for my asking .
christie	ackroyd	“ you know the result of her investigations . ralph paton _had_ had a pair of boots with him . the first question i asked him when he came to my house yesterday morning was what he was wearing on his feet on the fatal night . he replied at once that he had worn _boots_—he was still wearing them , in fact—having nothing else to put on .
christie	ackroyd	“ so we get a step further in our description of the murderer—a person who had the opportunity to take these shoes of ralph paton ’ s from the three boars that day . ”
christie	ackroyd	he paused , and then said , with a slightly raised voice : — “ there is one further point . the murderer must have been a person who had the opportunity to purloin that dagger from the silver table . you might argue that any one in the house might have done so , but i will recall to you that miss ackroyd was very positive that the dagger was not there when she examined the silver table . ”
christie	ackroyd	he paused again . “ let us recapitulate—now that all is clear . a person who was at the three boars earlier that day , a person who knew ackroyd well enough to know that he had purchased a dictaphone , a person who was of a mechanical turn of mind , who had the opportunity to take the dagger from the silver table before miss flora arrived , who had with him a receptacle suitable for hiding the dictaphone—such as a black bag , and who had the study to himself for a few minutes after the crime was discovered while parker was telephoning for the police . in fact—_dr . sheppard ! _ ”
christie	ackroyd	chapter xxvi and nothing but the truth there was a dead silence for a minute and a half . then i laughed . “ you ’ re mad , ” i said . “ no , ” said poirot placidly . “ i am not mad . it was the little discrepancy in time that first drew my attention to you—right at the beginning . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ discrepancy in time ? ” i queried , puzzled . “ but yes . you will remember that every one agreed—you yourself included—that it took five minutes to walk from the lodge to the house—less if you took the short cut to the terrace . but you left the house at ten minutes to nine—both by your own statement and that of parker , and yet it was nine o ’ clock as you passed through the lodge gates . it was a chilly night—not an evening a man would be inclined to dawdle ; why had you taken ten minutes to do a five-minutes ’ walk ? all along i realized that we had only your statement for it that the study window was ever fastened . ackroyd asked you if you had done so—he never looked to see . supposing , then , that the study window was unfastened ? would there be time in that ten minutes for you to run round the outside of the house , change your shoes , climb in through the window , kill ackroyd , and get to the gate by nine o ’ clock ? i decided against that theory since in all probability a man as nervous as ackroyd was that night would hear you climbing in , and then there would have been a struggle . but supposing that you killed ackroyd _before_ you left—as you were standing beside his chair ? then you go out of the front door , run round to the summer-house , take ralph paton ’ s shoes out of the bag you brought up with you that night , slip them on , walk through the mud in them , and leave prints on the window ledge , you climb in , lock the study door on the inside , run back to the summer-house , change back into your own shoes , and race down to the gate . ( i went through similar actions the other day , when you were with mrs. ackroyd—it took ten minutes exactly . ) then home—and an alibi—since you had timed the dictaphone for half-past nine . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ my dear poirot , ” i said in a voice that sounded strange and forced to my own ears , “ you ’ ve been brooding over this case too long . what on earth had i to gain by murdering ackroyd ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ safety . it was you who blackmailed mrs. ferrars . who could have had a better knowledge of what killed mr. ferrars than the doctor who was attending him ? when you spoke to me that first day in the garden , you mentioned a legacy received about a year ago . i have been unable to discover any trace of a legacy . you had to invent some way of accounting for mrs. ferrars ’ s twenty thousand pounds . it has not done you much good . you lost most of it in speculation—then you put the screw on too hard , and mrs. ferrars took a way out that you had not expected . if ackroyd had learnt the truth he would have had no mercy on you—you were ruined for ever . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ and the telephone call ? ” i asked , trying to rally . “ you have a plausible explanation of that also , i suppose ? ” “ i will confess to you that it was my greatest stumbling block when i found that a call had actually been put through to you from king ’ s abbot station . i at first believed that you had simply invented the story . it was a very clever touch , that . you must have some excuse for arriving at fernly , finding the body , and so getting the chance to remove the dictaphone on which your alibi depended . i had a very vague notion of how it was worked when i came to see your sister that first day and inquired as to what patients you had seen on friday morning . i had no thought of miss russell in my mind at that time . her visit was a lucky coincidence , since it distracted your mind from the real object of my questions . i found what i was looking for . among your patients that morning was the steward of an american liner . who more suitable than he to be leaving for liverpool by the train that evening ? and afterwards he would be on the high seas , well out of the way . i noted that the _orion_ sailed on saturday , and having obtained the name of the steward i sent him a wireless message asking a certain question . this is his reply you saw me receive just now . ”
christie	ackroyd	he held out the message to me . it ran as follows— “ quite correct . dr. sheppard asked me to leave a note at a patient ’ s house . i was to ring him up from the station with the reply . reply was ‘ no answer . ’ ”
christie	ackroyd	* * * * * “ it was a clever idea , ” said poirot . “ the call was genuine . your sister saw you take it . but there was only one man ’ s word as to what was actually said—your own ! ”
christie	ackroyd	i yawned . “ all this , ” i said , “ is very interesting—but hardly in the sphere of practical politics. ” “ you think not ? remember what i said—the truth goes to inspector raglan in the morning . but , for the sake of your good sister , i am willing to give you the chance of another way out . there might be , for instance , an overdose of a sleeping draught . you comprehend me ? but captain ralph paton must be cleared—_ça va sans dire_ . i should suggest that you finish that very interesting manuscript of yours—but abandoning your former reticence . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ you seem to be very prolific of suggestions , ” i remarked . “ are you sure you ’ ve quite finished. ” “ now that you remind me of the fact , it is true that there is one thing more . it would be most unwise on your part to attempt to silence me as you silenced m. ackroyd . that kind of business does not succeed against hercule poirot , you understand . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ my dear poirot , ” i said , smiling a little , “ whatever else i may be , i am not a fool. ” i rose to my feet . “ well , well , ” i said , with a slight yawn , “ i must be off home . thank you for a most interesting and instructive evening . ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot also rose and bowed with his accustomed politeness as i passed out of the room . chapter xxvii apologia five a.m . i am very tired—but i have finished my task . my arm aches from writing .
christie	ackroyd	a strange end to my manuscript . i meant it to be published some day as the history of one of poirot ’ s failures ! odd , how things pan out . all along i ’ ve had a premonition of disaster , from the moment i saw ralph paton and mrs. ferrars with their heads together . i thought then that she was confiding in him ; as it happened i was quite wrong there , but the idea persisted even after i went into the study with ackroyd that night , until he told me the truth .
christie	ackroyd	poor old ackroyd . i ’ m always glad that i gave him a chance . i urged him to read that letter before it was too late . or let me be honest—didn ’ t i subconsciously realize that with a pig-headed chap like him , it was my best chance of getting him _not_ to read it ? his nervousness that night was interesting psychologically . he knew danger was close at hand . and yet he never suspected _me_ .
christie	ackroyd	the dagger was an afterthought . i ’ d brought up a very handy little weapon of my own , but when i saw the dagger lying in the silver table , it occurred to me at once how much better it would be to use a weapon that couldn ’ t be traced to me .
christie	ackroyd	i suppose i must have meant to murder him all along . as soon as i heard of mrs. ferrars ’ s death , i felt convinced that she would have told him everything before she died . when i met him and he seemed so agitated , i thought that perhaps he knew the truth , but that he couldn ’ t bring himself to believe it , and was going to give me the chance of refuting it .
christie	ackroyd	so i went home and took my precautions . if the trouble were after all only something to do with ralph—well , no harm would have been done . the dictaphone he had given me two days before to adjust . something had gone a little wrong with it , and i persuaded him to let me have a go at it , instead of sending it back . i did what i wanted to it , and took it up with me in my bag that evening .
christie	ackroyd	i am rather pleased with myself as a writer . what could be neater , for instance , than the following : — “ _the letters were brought in at twenty minutes to nine . it was just on ten minutes to nine when i left him , the letter still unread . i hesitated with my hand on the door handle , looking back and wondering if there was anything i had left undone._ ”
christie	ackroyd	all true , you see . but suppose i had put a row of stars after the first sentence ! would somebody then have wondered what exactly happened in that blank ten minutes ?
christie	ackroyd	when i looked round the room from the door , i was quite satisfied . nothing had been left undone . the dictaphone was on the table by the window , timed to go off at nine-thirty ( the mechanism of that little device was rather clever—based on the principle of an alarm clock ) , and the arm-chair was pulled out so as to hide it from the door .
christie	ackroyd	i must admit that it gave me rather a shock to run into parker just outside the door . i have faithfully recorded that fact . then later , when the body was discovered , and i had sent parker to telephone for the police , what a judicious use of words : “ _i did what little had to be done ! _ ” it was quite little—just to shove the dictaphone into my bag and push back the chair against the wall in its proper place . i never dreamed that parker would have noticed that chair . logically , he ought to have been so agog over the body as to be blind to everything else . but i hadn ’ t reckoned with the trained-servant complex .
christie	ackroyd	i wish i could have known beforehand that flora was going to say she ’ d seen her uncle alive at a quarter to ten . that puzzled me more than i can say . in fact , all through the case there have been things that puzzled me hopelessly . every one seems to have taken a hand .
christie	ackroyd	my greatest fear all through has been caroline . i have fancied she might guess . curious the way she spoke that day of my “ strain of weakness. ” well , she will never know the truth . there is , as poirot said , one way out ....
christie	ackroyd	i can trust him . he and inspector raglan will manage it between them . i should not like caroline to know . she is fond of me , and then , too , she is proud .... my death will be a grief to her , but grief passes ....
christie	ackroyd	when i have finished writing , i shall enclose this whole manuscript in an envelope and address it to poirot . and then—what shall it be ? veronal ? there would be a kind of poetic justice . not that i take any responsibility for mrs. ferrars ’ s death . it was the direct consequence of her own actions . i feel no pity for her .
christie	ackroyd	i have no pity for myself either . so let it be veronal . but i wish hercule poirot had never retired from work and come here to grow vegetable marrows . the end

christie	poirot	“ has he any relatives in england ? ” “ two aunts . a mrs. everard , who lives at hampstead , and a miss daniels , who lives near ascot. ” “ ascot ? that is near to windsor , is it not ? ”
christie	poirot	“ that point has not been overlooked . but it has led to nothing. ” “ you regard the capitaine daniels , then , as above suspicion ? ” a shade of bitterness crept into lord estair ’ s voice , as he replied :
christie	poirot	“ no , monsieur poirot . in these days , i should hesitate before i pronounced _anyone_ above suspicion. ” “ _très bien_ . now i understand , _milord_ , that the prime minister would , as a matter of course , be under vigilant police protection , which ought to render any assault upon him an impossibility ? ”
christie	poirot	lord estair bowed his head . “ that is so . the prime minister ’ s car was closely followed by another car containing detectives in plain clothes . mr. macadam knew nothing of these precautions . he is personally a most fearless man , and would be inclined to sweep them away arbitrarily . but , naturally , the police make their own arrangements . in fact , the premier ’ s chauffeur , o ’ murphy , is a c.i.d . man . ”
christie	poirot	“ o ’ murphy ? that is a name of ireland , is it not so ? ” “ yes , he is an irishman. ” “ from what part of ireland ? ” “ county clare , i believe. ” “ _tiens ! _ but proceed , _milord_. ” “ the premier started for london . the car was a closed one . he and captain daniels sat inside . the second car followed as usual . but , unluckily , for some unknown reason , the prime minister ’ s car deviated from the main road—— ”
christie	poirot	“ at a point where the road curves ? ” interrupted poirot . “ yes—but how did you know ? ” “ oh , _c ’ est évident_ ! continue ! ” “ for some unknown reason , ” continued lord estair , “ the premier ’ s car left the main road . the police car , unaware of the deviation , continued to keep to the high road . at a short distance down the unfrequented lane , the prime minister ’ s car was suddenly held up by a band of masked men . the chauffeur—— ”
christie	poirot	“ that brave o ’ murphy ! ” murmured poirot thoughtfully . “ the chauffeur , momentarily taken aback , jammed on the brakes . the prime minister put his head out of the window . instantly a shot rang out—then another . the first one grazed his cheek , the second , fortunately , went wide . the chauffeur , now realizing the danger , instantly forged straight ahead , scattering the band of men . ”
christie	poirot	“ a near escape , ” i ejaculated , with a shiver . “ mr . macadam refused to make any fuss over the slight wound he had received . he declared it was only a scratch . he stopped at a local cottage hospital , where it was dressed and bound up—he did not , of course , reveal his identity . he then drove , as per schedule , straight to charing cross , where a special train for dover was awaiting him , and , after a brief account of what had happened had been given to the anxious police by captain daniels , he duly departed for france . at dover , he went on board the waiting destroyer . at boulogne , as you know , the bogus car was waiting for him , carrying the union jack , and correct in every detail . ”
christie	poirot	“ that is all you have to tell me ? ” “ yes. ” “ there is no other circumstance that you have omitted , milord ? ” “ well , there is one rather peculiar thing. ” “ yes ? ” “ the prime minister ’ s car did not return home after leaving the prime minister at charing cross . the police were anxious to interview o ’ murphy , so a search was instituted at once . the car was discovered standing outside a certain unsavoury little restaurant in soho , which is well known as a meeting-place of german agents . ”
christie	poirot	“ and the chauffeur ? ” “ the chauffeur was nowhere to be found . he , too , had disappeared. ” “ so , ” said poirot thoughtfully , “ there are two disappearances : the prime minister in france , and o ’ murphy in london . ”
christie	poirot	he looked keenly at lord estair , who made a gesture of despair . “ i can only tell you , monsieur poirot , that , if anyone had suggested to me yesterday that o ’ murphy was a traitor , i should have laughed in his face . ”
christie	poirot	“ and to-day ? ” “ to-day i do not know what to think. ” poirot nodded gravely . he looked at his turnip of a watch again . “ i understand that i have carte blanche , messieurs—in every way , i mean ? i must be able to go where i choose , and how i choose . ”
christie	poirot	“ perfectly . there is a special train leaving for dover in an hour ’ s time , with a further contingent from scotland yard . you shall be accompanied by a military officer and a c.i.d . man , who will hold themselves at your disposal in every way . is that satisfactory ? ”
christie	poirot	“ quite . one more question before you leave , messieurs . what made you come to me ? i am unknown , obscure , in this great london of yours. ” “ we sought you out on the express recommendation and wish of a very great man of your own country . ”
christie	poirot	“ _comment ? _ my old friend the _préfet_—— ? ” lord estair shook his head . “ one higher than the _préfet_ . one whose word was once law in belgium—and shall be again ! that england has sworn ! ”
christie	poirot	poirot ’ s hand flew swiftly to a dramatic salute . “ amen to that ! ah , but my master does not forget . . . . messieurs , i , hercule poirot , will serve you faithfully . heaven only send that it will be in time . but this is dark—dark . . . . i can not see . ”
christie	poirot	“ well , poirot , ” i cried impatiently , as the door closed behind the ministers , “ what do you think ? ” my friend was busy packing a minute suitcase , with quick , deft movements . he shook his head thoughtfully .
christie	poirot	“ i do not know what to think . my brains desert me. ” “ why , as you said , kidnap him , when a knock on the head would do as well ? ” i mused . “ pardon me , _mon ami_ , but i did not quite say that . it is undoubtedly far more their affair to kidnap him . ”
christie	poirot	“ but why ? ” “ because uncertainty creates panic . that is one reason . were the prime minister dead , it would be a terrible calamity , but the situation would have to be faced . but now you have paralysis . will the prime minister reappear , or will he not ? is he dead or alive ? nobody knows , and until they know nothing definite can be done . and , as i tell you , uncertainty breeds panic , which is what _les boches_ are playing for . then , again , if the kidnappers are holding him secretly somewhere , they have the advantage of being able to make terms with both sides . the german government is not a liberal paymaster , as a rule , but no doubt they can be made to disgorge substantial remittances in such a case as this . thirdly , they run no risk of the hangman ’ s rope . oh , decidedly , kidnapping is their affair . ”
christie	poirot	“ then , if that is so , why should they first try to shoot him ? ” poirot made a gesture of anger . “ ah , that is just what i do not understand ! it is inexplicable—stupid ! they have all their arrangements made ( and very good arrangements too ! ) for the abduction , and yet they imperil the whole affair by a melodramatic attack , worthy of a cinema , and quite as unreal . it is almost impossible to believe in it , with its band of masked men , not twenty miles from london ! ”
christie	poirot	“ perhaps they were two quite separate attempts which happened irrespective of each other , ” i suggested . “ ah , no , that would be too much of a coincidence ! then , further—who is the traitor ? there must have been a traitor—in the first affair , anyway . but who was it—daniels or o ’ murphy ? it must have been one of the two , or why did the car leave the main road ? we can not suppose that the prime minister connived at his own assassination ! did o ’ murphy take that turning of his own accord , or was it daniels who told him to do so ? ”
christie	poirot	“ surely it must have been o ’ murphy ’ s doing. ” “ yes , because if it was daniels ’ the prime minister would have heard the order , and would have asked the reason . but there are altogether too many ‘ whys ’ in this affair , and they contradict each other . if o ’ murphy is an honest man , _why_ did he leave the main road ? but if he was a dishonest man , _why_ did he start the car again when only two shots had been fired—thereby , in all probability , saving the prime minister ’ s life ? and , again , if he was honest , why did he , immediately on leaving charing cross , drive to a well-known rendezvous of german spies ? ”
christie	poirot	“ it looks bad , ” i said . “ let us look at the case with method . what have we for and against these two men ? take o ’ murphy first . against : that his conduct in leaving the main road was suspicious ; that he is an irishman from county clare ; that he has disappeared in a highly suggestive manner . for : that his promptness in restarting the car saved the premier ’ s life ; that he is a scotland yard man , and , obviously , from the post allotted to him , a trusted detective . now for daniels . there is not much against him , except the fact that nothing is known of his antecedents , and that he speaks too many languages for a good englishman ! ( pardon me , _mon ami_ , but , as linguists , you are deplorable ! ) _now for him_ , we have the fact that he was found gagged , bound , and chloroformed—which does not look as though he had anything to do with the matter . ”
christie	poirot	“ he might have gagged and bound himself , to divert suspicion. ” poirot shook his head . “ the french police would make no mistake of that kind . besides , once he had attained his object , and the prime minister was safely abducted , there would not be much point in his remaining behind . his accomplices _could_ have gagged and chloroformed him , of course , but i fail to see what object they hoped to accomplish by it . he can be of little use to them now , for , until the circumstances concerning the prime minister have been cleared up , he is bound to be closely watched . ”
christie	poirot	“ perhaps he hoped to start the police on a false scent ? ” “ then why did he not do so ? he merely says that something was pressed over his nose and mouth , and that he remembers nothing more . there is no false scent there . it sounds remarkably like the truth . ”
christie	poirot	“ well , ” i said , glancing at the clock , “ i suppose we ’ d better start for the station . you may find more clues in france. ” “ possibly , _mon ami_ , but i doubt it . it is still incredible to me that the prime minister has not been discovered in that limited area , where the difficulty of concealing him must be tremendous . if the military and the police of two countries have not found him , how shall i ? ”
christie	poirot	at charing cross we were met by mr . dodge . “ this is detective barnes , of scotland yard , and major norman . they will hold themselves entirely at your disposal . good luck to you . it ’ s a bad business , but i ’ ve not given up hope . must be off now. ” and the minister strode rapidly away .
christie	poirot	we chatted in a desultory fashion with major norman . in the centre of the little group of men on the platform i recognized a little ferret-faced fellow talking to a tall , fair man . he was an old acquaintance of poirot ’ s—detective-inspector japp , supposed to be one of the smartest of scotland yard ’ s officers . he came over and greeted my friend cheerfully .
christie	poirot	“ i heard you were on this job too . smart bit of work . so far they ’ ve got away with the goods all right . but i can ’ t believe they can keep him hidden long . our people are going through france with a toothcomb . so are the french . i can ’ t help feeling it ’ s only a matter of hours now . ”
christie	poirot	“ that is , if he ’ s still alive , ” remarked the tall detective gloomily . japp ’ s face fell . “ yes . . . . but somehow i ’ ve got the feeling he ’ s alive all right. ” poirot nodded . “ yes , yes ; he ’ s alive . but can he be found in time ? i , like you , did not believe he could be hidden so long . ”
christie	poirot	the whistle blew , and we all trooped up into the pullman car . then , with a slow , unwilling jerk , the train drew out of the station . it was a curious journey . the scotland yard men crowded together . maps of northern france were spread out , and eager forefingers traced the lines of roads and villages . each man had his own pet theory . poirot showed none of his usual loquacity , but sat staring in front of him , with an expression on his face that reminded me of a puzzled child . i talked to norman , whom i found quite an amusing fellow . on arriving at dover poirot ’ s behaviour moved me to intense amusement . the little man , as he went on board the boat , clutched desperately at my arm . the wind was blowing lustily .
christie	poirot	“ _mon dieu ! _ ” he murmured . “ this is terrible ! ” “ have courage , poirot , ” i cried . “ you will succeed . you will find him . i am sure of it. ” “ ah , _mon ami_ , you mistake my emotion . it is this villainous sea that troubles me ! the _mal de mer_—it is horrible suffering ! ”
christie	poirot	“ oh ! ” i said , rather taken aback . the first throb of the engines was felt , and poirot groaned and closed his eyes . “ major norman has a map of northern france if you would like to study it ? ”
christie	poirot	poirot shook his head impatiently . “ but no , but no ! leave me , my friend . see you , to think , the stomach and the brain must be in harmony . laverguier has a method most excellent for averting the _mal de mer_ . you breathe in—and out—slowly , so—turning the head from left to right and counting six between each breath . ”
christie	poirot	i left him to his gymnastic endeavours , and went on deck . as we came slowly into boulogne harbour poirot appeared , neat and smiling , and announced to me in a whisper that laverguier ’ s system had succeeded “ to a marvel ! ”
christie	poirot	japp ’ s forefinger was still tracing imaginary routes on his map . “ nonsense ! the car started from boulogne—here they branched off . now , my idea is that they transferred the prime minister to another car . see ? ”
christie	poirot	“ well , ” said the tall detective , “ i shall make for the seaports . ten to one , they ’ ve smuggled him on board a ship. ” japp shook his head . “ too obvious . the order went out at once to close all the ports . ”
christie	poirot	the day was just breaking as we landed . major norman touched poirot on the arm . “ there ’ s a military car here waiting for you , sir. ” “ thank you , monsieur . but , for the moment , i do not propose to leave boulogne . ”
christie	poirot	“ what ? ” “ no , we will enter this hotel here , by the quay. ” he suited the action to the word , demanded and was accorded a private room . we three followed him , puzzled and uncomprehending .
christie	poirot	he shot a quick glance at us . “ it is not so that the good detective should act , eh ? i perceive your thought . he must be full of energy . he must rush to and fro . he should prostrate himself on the dusty road and seek the marks of tyres through a little glass . he must gather up the cigarette-end , the fallen match ? that is your idea , is it not ? ”
christie	poirot	his eyes challenged us . “ but i—hercule poirot—tell you that it is not so ! the true clues are within—_here_ ! ” he tapped his forehead . “ see you , i need not have left london . it would have been sufficient for me to sit quietly in my rooms there . all that matters is the little grey cells within . secretly and silently they do their part , until suddenly i call for a map , and i lay my finger on a spot—so—and i say : the prime minister is _there_ ! and it is so ! with method and logic one can accomplish anything ! this frantic rushing to france was a mistake—it is playing a child ’ s game of hide-and-seek . but now , though it may be too late , i will set to work the right way , from within . silence , my friends , i beg of you . ”
christie	poirot	and for five long hours the little man sat motionless , blinking his eyelids like a cat , his green eyes flickering and becoming steadily greener and greener . the scotland yard man was obviously contemptuous , major norman was bored and impatient , and i myself found the time pass with wearisome slowness .
christie	poirot	finally , i got up , and strolled as noiselessly as i could to the window . the matter was becoming a farce . i was secretly concerned for my friend . if he failed , i would have preferred him to fail in a less ridiculous manner . out of the window i idly watched the daily leave boat , belching forth columns of smoke , as she lay alongside the quay .
christie	poirot	suddenly i was aroused by poirot ’ s voice close to my elbow . “ _mes amis_ , let us start ! ” i turned . an extraordinary transformation had come over my friend . his eyes were flickering with excitement , his chest was swelled to the uttermost .
christie	poirot	“ i have been an imbecile , my friends ! but i see daylight at last. ” major norman moved hastily to the door . “ i ’ ll order the car. ” “ there is no need . i shall not use it . thank heaven the wind has fallen . ”
christie	poirot	“ do you mean you are going to walk , sir ? ” “ no , my young friend . i am no st. peter . i prefer to cross the sea by boat. ” “ to cross the _sea_ ? ”
christie	poirot	“ yes . to work with method , one must begin from the beginning . and the beginning of this affair was in england . therefore , we return to england. ” • • • • • • •
christie	poirot	at three o ’ clock , we stood once more upon charing cross platform . to all our expostulations , poirot turned a deaf ear , and reiterated again and again that to start at the beginning was not a waste of time , but the only way . on the way over , he had conferred with norman in a low voice , and the latter had despatched a sheaf of telegrams from dover .
christie	poirot	owing to the special passes held by norman , we got through everywhere in record time . in london , a large police car was waiting for us , with some plain-clothes men , one of whom handed a typewritten sheet of paper to my friend . he answered my inquiring glance .
christie	poirot	“ a list of the cottage hospitals within a certain radius west of london . i wired for it from dover. ” we were whirled rapidly through the london streets . we were on the bath road . on we went , through hammersmith , chiswick and brentford . i began to see our objective . through windsor and on to ascot . my heart gave a leap . ascot was where daniels had an aunt living . we were after _him_ , then , not o ’ murphy .
christie	poirot	we duly stopped at the gate of a trim villa . poirot jumped out and rang the bell . i saw a perplexed frown dimming the radiance of his face . plainly , he was not satisfied . the bell was answered . he was ushered inside . in a few moments he reappeared , and climbed into the car with a short , sharp shake of his head . my hopes began to die down . it was past four now . even if he found certain evidence incriminating daniels , what would be the good of it , unless he could wring from some one the exact spot in france where they were holding the prime minister ?
christie	poirot	our return progress towards london was an interrupted one . we deviated from the main road more than once , and occasionally stopped at a small building , which i had no difficulty in recognizing as a cottage hospital . poirot only spent a few minutes at each , but at every halt his radiant assurance was more and more restored .
christie	poirot	he whispered something to norman , to which the latter replied : “ yes , if you turn off to the left , you will find them waiting by the bridge. ” we turned up a side road , and in the failing light i discerned a second car , waiting by the side of the road . it contained two men in plain clothes . poirot got down and spoke to them , and then we started off in a northerly direction , the other car following close behind .
christie	poirot	we drove for some time , our objective being obviously one of the northern suburbs of london . finally , we drove up to the front door of a tall house , standing a little back from the road in its own grounds .
christie	poirot	norman and i were left with the car . poirot and one of the detectives went up to the door and rang . a neat parlourmaid opened it . the detective spoke . “ i am a police officer , and i have a warrant to search this house . ”
christie	poirot	the girl gave a little scream , and a tall , handsome woman of middle-age appeared behind her in the hall . “ shut the door , edith . they are burglars , i expect. ” but poirot swiftly inserted his foot in the door , and at the same moment blew a whistle . instantly the other detectives ran up , and poured into the house , shutting the door behind them .
christie	poirot	norman and i spent about five minutes cursing our forced inactivity . finally the door reopened , and the men emerged , escorting three prisoners—a woman and two men . the woman , and one of the men , were taken to the second car . the other man was placed in our car by poirot himself .
christie	poirot	“ i must go with the others , my friend . but have great care of this gentleman . you do not know him , no ? _eh bien_ , let me present to you , monsieur o ’ murphy ! ”
christie	poirot	o ’ murphy ! i _gaped_ at him open-mouthed as we started again . he was not handcuffed , but i did not fancy he would try to escape . he sat there staring in front of him as though dazed . anyway , norman and i would be more than a match for him .
christie	poirot	to my surprise , we still kept a northerly route . we were not returning to london , then ! i was much puzzled . suddenly , as the car slowed down , i recognized that we were close to hendon aerodrome . immediately i grasped poirot ’ s idea . he proposed to reach france by aeroplane .
christie	poirot	it was a sporting idea , but , on the face of it , impracticable . a telegram would be far quicker . time was everything . he must leave the personal glory of rescuing the prime minister to others .
christie	poirot	as we drew up , major norman jumped out , and a plain-clothes man took his place . he conferred with poirot for a few minutes , and then went off briskly . i , too , jumped out , and caught poirot by the arm .
christie	poirot	“ i congratulate you , old fellow ! they have told you the hiding-place ? but , look here , you must wire to france at once . you ’ ll be too late if you go yourself. ” poirot looked at me curiously for a minute or two .
christie	poirot	“ unfortunately , my friend , there are some things that can not be sent by telegram. ” • • • • • • •
christie	poirot	at that moment major norman returned , accompanied by a young officer in the uniform of the flying corps . “ this is captain lyall , who will fly you over to france . he can start at once . ”
christie	poirot	“ wrap up warmly , sir , ” said the young pilot . “ i can lend you a coat , if you like. ” poirot was consulting his enormous watch . he murmured to himself : “ yes , there is time—just time. ” then he looked up , and bowed politely to the young officer . “ i thank you , monsieur . but it is not i who am your passenger . it is this gentleman here . ”
christie	poirot	he moved a little aside as he spoke , and a figure came forward out of the darkness . it was the second male prisoner who had gone in the other car , and as the light fell on his face , i gave a gasp of surprise .
christie	poirot	_it was the prime minister ! _ • • • • • • • “ for heaven ’ s sake , tell me all about it , ” i cried impatiently , as poirot , norman , and i motored back to london . “ how in the world did they manage to smuggle him back to england ? ”
christie	poirot	“ there was no need to smuggle him back , ” replied poirot dryly . “ the prime minister has never left england . he was kidnapped on his way from windsor to london. ” “ what ? ” “ i will make all clear . the prime minister was in his car , his secretary beside him . suddenly a pad of chloroform is clapped on his face—— ”
christie	poirot	“ but by whom ? ” “ by the clever linguistic captain daniels . as soon as the prime minister is unconscious , daniels picks up the speaking-tube , and directs o ’ murphy to turn to the right , which the chauffeur , quite unsuspicious , does . a few yards down that unfrequented road , a large car is standing , apparently broken down . its driver signals to o ’ murphy to stop . o ’ murphy slows up . the stranger approaches . daniels leans out of the window , and , probably with the aid of an instantaneous anæsthetic , such as ethylchloride , the chloroform trick is repeated . in a few seconds , the two helpless men are dragged out and transferred to the other car , and a pair of substitutes take their places . ”
christie	poirot	“ impossible ! ” “ _pas du tout ! _ have you not seen music-hall turns imitating celebrities with marvellous accuracy ? nothing is easier than to personate a public character . the prime minister of england is far easier to understudy than mr. john smith of clapham , say . as for o ’ murphy ’ s ‘ double , ’ no one was going to take much notice of him until after the departure of the prime minister , and by then he would have made himself scarce . he drives straight from charing cross to the meeting-place of his friends . he goes in as o ’ murphy , he emerges as some one quite different . o ’ murphy has disappeared , leaving a conveniently suspicious trail behind him . ”
christie	poirot	“ but the man who personated the prime minister was seen by every one ! ” “ he was not seen by anyone who knew him privately or intimately . and daniels shielded him from contact with anyone as much as possible . moreover , his face was bandaged up , and anything unusual in his manner would be put down to the fact that he was suffering from shock as a result of the attempt upon his life . mr. macadam has a weak throat , and always spares his voice as much as possible before any great speech . the deception was perfectly easy to keep up as far as france . there it would be impracticable and impossible—so the prime minister disappears . the police of this country hurry across the channel , and no one bothers to go into the details of the first attack . to sustain the illusion that the abduction has taken place in france , daniels is gagged and chloroformed in a convincing manner . ”
christie	poirot	“ and the man who has enacted the part of the prime minister ? ” “ rids himself of his disguise . he and the bogus chauffeur may be arrested as suspicious characters , but no one will dream of suspecting their real part in the drama , and they will eventually be released for lack of evidence . ”
christie	poirot	“ and the real prime minister ? ” “ he and o ’ murphy were driven straight to the house of ‘ mrs . everard , ’ at hampstead , daniels ’ so-called ‘ aunt. ’ in reality , she is frau bertha ebenthal , and the police have been looking for her for some time . it is a valuable little present that i have made to them—to say nothing of daniels ! ah , it was a clever plan , but he did not reckon on the cleverness of hercule poirot ! ”
christie	poirot	i think my friend might well be excused his moment of vanity . “ when did you first begin to suspect the truth of the matter ? ” “ when i began to work the right way—from _within_ ! i could not make that shooting affair fit in—but when i saw that the net result of it was that _the prime minister went to france with his face bound up_ i began to comprehend ! and when i visited all the cottage hospitals between windsor and london , and found that no one answering to my description had had his face bound up and dressed that morning , i was sure ! after that , it was child ’ s-play for a mind like mine ! ”
christie	poirot	• • • • • • • the following morning , poirot showed me a telegram he had just received . it had no place of origin , and was unsigned . it ran :
christie	poirot	“ in time. ” later in the day the evening papers published an account of the allied conference . they laid particular stress on the magnificent ovation accorded to mr. david macadam , whose inspiring speech had produced a deep and lasting impression .
christie	poirot	ix the disappearance of mr. davenheim poirot and i were expecting our old friend inspector japp of scotland yard to tea . we were sitting round the tea-table awaiting his arrival . poirot had just finished carefully straightening the cups and saucers which our landlady was in the habit of throwing , rather than placing , on the table . he had also breathed heavily on the metal teapot , and polished it with a silk handkerchief . the kettle was on the boil , and a small enamel saucepan beside it contained some thick , sweet chocolate which was more to poirot ’ s palate than what he described as “ your english poison. ” a sharp “ rat-tat ” sounded below , and a few minutes afterwards japp entered briskly .
christie	poirot	“ hope i ’ m not late , ” he said as he greeted us . “ to tell the truth , i was yarning with miller , the man who ’ s in charge of the davenheim case. ” i pricked up my ears . for the last three days the papers had been full of the strange disappearance of mr. davenheim , senior partner of davenheim and salmon , the well-known bankers and financiers . on saturday last he had walked out of his house , and had never been seen since . i looked forward to extracting some interesting details from japp .
christie	poirot	“ i should have thought , ” i remarked , “ that it would be almost impossible for anyone to ‘ disappear ’ nowadays. ” poirot moved a plate of bread and butter the eighth of an inch , and said sharply :
christie	poirot	“ be exact , my friend . what do you mean by ‘ disappear ’ ? to which class of disappearance are you referring ? ” “ are disappearances classified and labelled , then ? ” i laughed . japp smiled also . poirot frowned at us both .
christie	poirot	“ but certainly they are ! they fall into three categories : first , and most common , the voluntary disappearance . second , the much abused ‘ loss of memory ’ case—rare , but occasionally genuine . third , murder , and a more or less successful disposal of the body . do you refer to all three as impossible of execution ? ”
christie	poirot	“ very nearly so , i should think . you might lose your own memory , but some one would be sure to recognize you—especially in the case of a well-known man like davenheim . then ‘ bodies ’ can ’ t be made to vanish into thin air . sooner or later they turn up , concealed in lonely places , or in trunks . murder will out . in the same way , the absconding clerk , or the domestic defaulter , is bound to be run down in these days of wireless telegraphy . he can be headed off from foreign countries ; ports and railway stations are watched ; and , as for concealment in this country , his features and appearance will be known to every one who reads a daily newspaper . he ’ s up against civilization . ”
christie	poirot	“ _mon ami_ , ” said poirot , “ you make one error . you do not allow for the fact that a man who had decided to make away with another man—or with himself in a figurative sense—might be that rare machine , a man of method . he might bring intelligence , talent , a careful calculation of detail to the task ; and then i do not see why he should not be successful in baffling the police force . ”
christie	poirot	“ but not _you_ , i suppose ? ” said japp good-humouredly , winking at me . “ he couldn ’ t baffle _you_ , eh , monsieur poirot ? ” poirot endeavoured , with a marked lack of success , to look modest . “ me , also ! why not ? it is true that i approach such problems with an exact science , a mathematical precision , which seems , alas , only too rare in the new generation of detectives ! ”
christie	poirot	japp grinned more widely . “ i don ’ t know , ” he said . “ miller , the man who ’ s on this case , is a smart chap . you may be very sure he won ’ t overlook a footprint , or a cigar-ash , or a crumb even . he ’ s got eyes that see everything . ”
christie	poirot	“ so , _mon ami_ , ” said poirot , “ has the london sparrow . but all the same , i should not ask the little brown bird to solve the problem of mr. davenheim. ” “ come now , monsieur , you ’ re not going to run down the value of details as clues ? ”
christie	poirot	“ by no means . these things are all good in their way . the danger is they may assume undue importance . most details are insignificant ; one or two are vital . it is the brain , the little grey cells ” —he tapped his forehead— “ on which one must rely . the senses mislead . one must seek the truth within—not without . ”
christie	poirot	“ you don ’ t mean to say , monsieur poirot , that you would undertake to solve a case without moving from your chair , do you ? ” “ that is exactly what i do mean—granted the facts were placed before me . i regard myself as a consulting specialist . ”
christie	poirot	japp slapped his knee . “ hanged if i don ’ t take you at your word . bet you a fiver that you can ’ t lay your hand—or rather tell me where to lay my hand—on mr. davenheim , dead or alive , before a week is out . ”
christie	poirot	poirot considered . “ _eh bien , mon ami_ , i accept . _le sport_ , it is the passion of you english . now—the facts. ” “ on saturday last , as is his usual custom , mr. davenheim took the 12.40 train from victoria to chingside , where his palatial country place , the cedars , is situated . after lunch , he strolled round the grounds , and gave various directions to the gardeners . everybody agrees that his manner was absolutely normal and as usual . after tea he put his head into his wife ’ s boudoir , saying that he was going to stroll down to the village and post some letters . he added that he was expecting a mr. lowen , on business . if he should come before he himself returned , he was to be shown into the study and asked to wait . mr. davenheim then left the house by the front door , passed leisurely down the drive , and out at the gate , and—was never seen again . from that hour , he vanished completely . ”
christie	poirot	“ pretty—very pretty—altogether a charming little problem , ” murmured poirot . “ proceed , my good friend. ” “ about a quarter of an hour later a tall , dark man with a thick black moustache rang the front-door bell , and explained that he had an appointment with mr. davenheim . he gave the name of lowen , and in accordance with the banker ’ s instructions was shown into the study . nearly an hour passed . mr. davenheim did not return . finally mr. lowen rang the bell , and explained that he was unable to wait any longer , as he must catch his train back to town . mrs. davenheim apologized for her husband ’ s absence , which seemed unaccountable , as she knew him to have been expecting the visitor . mr. lowen reiterated his regrets and took his departure .
christie	poirot	“ well , as every one knows , mr. davenheim did not return . early on sunday morning the police were communicated with , but could make neither head nor tail of the matter . mr. davenheim seemed literally to have vanished into thin air . he had not been to the post office ; nor had he been seen passing through the village . at the station they were positive he had not departed by any train . his own motor had not left the garage . if he had hired a car to meet him in some lonely spot , it seems almost certain that by this time , in view of the large reward offered for information , the driver of it would have come forward to tell what he knew . true , there was a small race-meeting at entfield , five miles away , and if he had walked to that station he might have passed unnoticed in the crowd . but since then his photograph and a full description of him have been circulated in every newspaper , and nobody has been able to give any news of him . we have , of course , received many letters from all over england , but each clue , so far , has ended in disappointment .
christie	poirot	“ on monday morning a further sensational discovery came to light . behind a portière in mr. davenheim ’ s study stands a safe , and that safe had been broken into and rifled . the windows were fastened securely on the inside , which seems to put an ordinary burglary out of court , unless , of course , an accomplice within the house fastened them again afterwards . on the other hand , sunday having intervened , and the household being in a state of chaos , it is likely that the burglary was committed on the saturday , and remained undetected until monday . ”
christie	poirot	“ _précisément_ , ” said poirot dryly . “ well , is he arrested , _ce pauvre m. lowen_ ? ” japp grinned . “ not yet . but he ’ s under pretty close supervision. ” poirot nodded . “ what was taken from the safe ? have you any idea ? ”
christie	poirot	“ we ’ ve been going into that with the junior partner of the firm and mrs. davenheim . apparently there was a considerable amount in bearer bonds , and a very large sum in notes , owing to some large transaction having been just carried through . there was also a small fortune in jewellery . all mrs. davenheim ’ s jewels were kept in the safe . the purchasing of them had become a passion with her husband of late years , and hardly a month passed that he did not make her a present of some rare and costly gem . ”
christie	poirot	“ altogether a good haul , ” said poirot thoughtfully . “ now , what about lowen ? is it known what his business was with davenheim that evening ? ” “ well , the two men were apparently not on very good terms . lowen is a speculator in quite a small way . nevertheless , he has been able once or twice to score a _coup_ off davenheim in the market , though it seems they seldom or never actually met . it was a matter concerning some south american shares which led the banker to make his appointment . ”
christie	poirot	“ had davenheim interests in south america , then ? ” “ i believe so . mrs. davenheim happened to mention that he spent all last autumn in buenos ayres. ” “ any trouble in his home life ? were the husband and wife on good terms ? ”
christie	poirot	“ i should say his domestic life was quite peaceful and uneventful . mrs. davenheim is a pleasant , rather unintelligent woman . quite a nonentity , i think. ” “ then we must not look for the solution of the mystery there . had he any enemies ? ”
christie	poirot	“ he had plenty of financial rivals , and no doubt there are many people whom he has got the better of who bear him no particular good-will . but there was no one likely to make away with him—and , if they had , where is the body ? ”
christie	poirot	“ exactly . as hastings says , bodies have a habit of coming to light with fatal persistency. ” “ by the way , one of the gardeners says he saw a figure going round to the side of the house toward the rose-garden . the long french window of the study opens on to the rose-garden , and mr. davenheim frequently entered and left the house that way . but the man was a good way off , at work on some cucumber frames , and can not even say whether it was the figure of his master or not . also , he can not fix the time with any accuracy . it must have been before six , as the gardeners cease work at that time . ”
christie	poirot	“ and mr. davenheim left the house ? ” “ about half-past five or thereabouts. ” “ what lies beyond the rose-garden ? ” “ a lake. ” “ with a boathouse ? ” “ yes , a couple of punts are kept there . i suppose you ’ re thinking of suicide , monsieur poirot ? well , i don ’ t mind telling you that miller ’ s going down to-morrow expressly to see that piece of water dragged . that ’ s the kind of man he is ! ”
christie	poirot	poirot smiled faintly , and turned to me . “ hastings , i pray you , hand me that copy of the _daily megaphone_ . if i remember rightly , there is an unusually clear photograph there of the missing man . ”
christie	poirot	i rose , and found the sheet required . poirot studied the features attentively . “ h ’ m ! ” he murmured . “ wears his hair rather long and wavy , full moustache and pointed beard , bushy eyebrows . eyes dark ? ”
christie	poirot	“ yes. ” “ hair and beard turning grey ? ” the detective nodded . “ well , monsieur poirot , what have you got to say to it all ? clear as daylight , eh ? ” “ on the contrary , most obscure . ”
christie	poirot	the scotland yard man looked pleased . “ which gives me great hopes of solving it , ” finished poirot placidly . “ eh ? ” “ i find it a good sign when a case is obscure . if a thing is clear as daylight—_eh bien_ , mistrust it ! some one has made it so . ”
christie	poirot	japp shook his head almost pityingly . “ well , each to their fancy . but it ’ s not a bad thing to see your way clear ahead. ” “ i do not see , ” murmured poirot . “ i shut my eyes—and think . ”
christie	poirot	japp sighed . “ well , you ’ ve got a clear week to think in. ” “ and you will bring me any fresh developments that arise—the result of the labours of the hard-working and lynx-eyed inspector miller , for instance ? ”
christie	poirot	“ certainly . that ’ s in the bargain. ” “ seems a shame , doesn ’ t it ? ” said japp to me as i accompanied him to the door . “ like robbing a child ! ” i could not help agreeing with a smile . i was still smiling as i re-entered the room .
christie	poirot	“ _eh bien ! _ ” said poirot immediately . “ you make fun of papa poirot , is it not so ? ” he shook his finger at me . “ you do not trust his grey cells ? ah , do not be confused ! let us discuss this little problem—incomplete as yet , i admit , but already showing one or two points of interest . ”
christie	poirot	“ the lake ! ” i said significantly . “ and even more than the lake , the boathouse ! ” i looked sidewise at poirot . he was smiling in his most inscrutable fashion . i felt that , for the moment , it would be quite useless to question him further .
christie	poirot	we heard nothing of japp until the following evening , when he walked in about nine o ’ clock . i saw at once by his expression that he was bursting with news of some kind .
christie	poirot	“ _eh bien_ , my friend , ” remarked poirot . “ all goes well ? but do not tell me that you have discovered the body of mr. davenheim in your lake , because i shall not believe you . ”
christie	poirot	“ we haven ’ t found the body , but we did find his _clothes_—the identical clothes he was wearing that day . what do you say to that ? ” “ any other clothes missing from the house ? ”
christie	poirot	“ no , his valet is quite positive on that point . the rest of his wardrobe is intact . there ’ s more . we ’ ve arrested lowen . one of the maids , whose business it is to fasten the bedroom windows , declares that she saw lowen coming _towards_ the study through the rose-garden about a quarter past six . that would be about ten minutes before he left the house . ”
christie	poirot	“ what does he himself say to that ? ” “ denied first of all that he had ever left the study . but the maid was positive , and he pretended afterwards that he had forgotten just stepping out of the window to examine an unusual species of rose . rather a weak story ! and there ’ s fresh evidence against him come to light . mr. davenheim always wore a thick gold ring set with a solitaire diamond on the little finger of his right hand . well , that ring was pawned in london on saturday night by a man called billy kellett ! he ’ s already known to the police—did three months last autumn for lifting an old gentleman ’ s watch . it seems he tried to pawn the ring at no less than five different places , succeeded at the last one , got gloriously drunk on the proceeds , assaulted a policeman , and was run in in consequence . i went to bow street with miller and saw him . he ’ s sober enough now , and i don ’ t mind admitting we pretty well frightened the life out of him , hinting he might be charged with murder . this is his yarn , and a very queer one it is .
christie	poirot	“ he was at entfield races on saturday , though i dare say scarfpins was his line of business , rather than betting . anyway , he had a bad day , and was down on his luck . he was tramping along the road to chingside , and sat down in a ditch to rest just before he got into the village . a few minutes later he noticed a man coming along the road to the village , ‘ dark-complexioned gent , with a big moustache , one of them city toffs , ’ is his description of the man .
christie	poirot	“ kellett was half concealed from the road by a heap of stones . just before he got abreast of him , the man looked quickly up and down the road , and seeing it apparently deserted he took a small object from his pocket and threw it over the hedge . then he went on towards the station . now , the object he had thrown over the hedge had fallen with a slight ‘ chink ’ which aroused the curiosity of the human derelict in the ditch . he investigated and , after a short search , discovered the ring ! that is kellett ’ s story . it ’ s only fair to say that lowen denies it utterly , and of course the word of a man like kellett can ’ t be relied upon in the slightest . it ’ s within the bounds of possibility that he met davenheim in the lane and robbed and murdered him . ”
christie	poirot	poirot shook his head . “ very improbable , _mon ami_ . he had no means of disposing of the body . it would have been found by now . secondly , the open way in which he pawned the ring makes it unlikely that he did murder to get it . thirdly , your sneak-thief is rarely a murderer . fourthly , as he has been in prison since saturday , it would be too much of a coincidence that he is able to give so accurate a description of lowen . ”
christie	poirot	japp nodded . “ i don ’ t say you ’ re not right . but all the same , you won ’ t get a jury to take much note of a jailbird ’ s evidence . what seems odd to me is that lowen couldn ’ t find a cleverer way of disposing of the ring . ”
christie	poirot	poirot shrugged his shoulders . “ well , after all , if it were found in the neighbourhood , it might be argued that davenheim himself had dropped it. ” “ but why remove it from the body at all ? ” i cried .
christie	poirot	“ there might be a reason for that , ” said japp . “ do you know that just beyond the lake , a little gate leads out on to the hill , and not three minutes ’ walk brings you to—what do you think ? —a _lime kiln_ . ”
christie	poirot	“ good heavens ! ” i cried . “ you mean that the lime which destroyed the body would be powerless to affect the metal of the ring ? ” “ exactly. ” “ it seems to me , ” i said , “ that that explains everything . what a horrible crime ! ”
christie	poirot	by common consent we both turned and looked at poirot . he seemed lost in reflection , his brow knitted , as though with some supreme mental effort . i felt that at last his keen intellect was asserting itself . what would his first words be ? we were not long left in doubt . with a sigh , the tension of his attitude relaxed , and turning to japp , he asked :
christie	poirot	“ have you any idea , my friend , whether mr. and mrs. davenheim occupied the same bedroom ? ” the question seemed so ludicrously inappropriate that for a moment we both stared in silence . then japp burst into a laugh . “ good lord , monsieur poirot , i thought you were coming out with something startling . as to your question , i ’ m sure i don ’ t know . ”
christie	poirot	“ you could find out ? ” asked poirot with curious persistence . “ oh , certainly—if you _really_ want to know. ” “ _merci , mon ami_ . i should be obliged if you would make a point of it . ”
christie	poirot	japp stared at him a few minutes longer , but poirot seemed to have forgotten us both . the detective shook his head sadly at me , and murmuring , “ poor old fellow ! war ’ s been too much for him ! ” gently withdrew from the room .
christie	poirot	as poirot still seemed sunk in a daydream , i took a sheet of paper , and amused myself by scribbling notes upon it . my friend ’ s voice aroused me . he had come out of his reverie , and was looking brisk and alert .
christie	poirot	“ _que faites-vous là , mon ami ? _ ” “ i was jotting down what occurred to me as the main points of interest in this affair. ” “ you become methodical—at last ! ” said poirot approvingly . i concealed my pleasure . “ shall i read them to you ? ”
christie	poirot	“ by all means. ” i cleared my throat . “ ‘ one : all the evidence points to lowen having been the man who forced the safe . “ ‘ two : he had a grudge against davenheim . “ ‘ three : he lied in his first statement that he had never left the study .
christie	poirot	“ ‘ four : if you accept billy kellett ’ s story as true , lowen is unmistakably implicated. ’ ” i paused . “ well ? ” i asked , for i felt that i had put my finger on all the vital facts .
christie	poirot	poirot looked at me pityingly , shaking his head very gently . “ _mon pauvre ami ! _ but it is that you have not the gift ! the important detail , you appreciate him never ! also , your reasoning is false . ”
christie	poirot	“ how ? ” “ let me take your four points . “ one : mr. lowen could not possibly know that he would have the chance to open the safe . he came for a business interview . he could not know beforehand that mr. davenheim would be absent posting a letter , and that he would consequently be alone in the study ! ”
christie	poirot	“ he might have seized his opportunity , ” i suggested . “ and the tools ? city gentlemen do not carry round housebreaker ’ s tools on the off chance ! and one could not cut into that safe with a penknife , _bien entendu_ ! ”
christie	poirot	“ well , what about number two ? ” “ you say lowen had a grudge against mr. davenheim . what you mean is that he had once or twice got the better of him . and presumably those transactions were entered into with the view of benefiting himself . in any case you do not as a rule bear a grudge against a man you have got the better of—it is more likely to be the other way about . whatever grudge there might have been would have been on mr. davenheim ’ s side . ”
christie	poirot	“ well , you can ’ t deny that he lied about never having left the study ? ” “ no . but he may have been frightened . remember , the missing man ’ s clothes had just been discovered in the lake . of course , as usual , he would have done better to speak the truth . ”
christie	poirot	“ and the fourth point ? ” “ i grant you that . if kellett ’ s story is true , lowen is undeniably implicated . that is what makes the affair so very interesting. ” “ then i did appreciate _one_ vital fact ? ”
christie	poirot	“ perhaps—but you have entirely overlooked the two most important points , the ones which undoubtedly hold the clue to the whole matter. ” “ and pray , what are they ? ” “ one , the passion which has grown upon mr. davenheim in the last few years for buying jewellery . two , his trip to buenos ayres last autumn . ”
christie	poirot	“ poirot , you are joking ! ” “ i am most serious . ah , sacred thunder , but i hope japp will not forget my little commission. ” but the detective , entering into the spirit of the joke , had remembered it so well that a telegram was handed to poirot about eleven o ’ clock the next day . at his request i opened it and read it out :
christie	poirot	“ ‘ husband and wife have occupied separate rooms since last winter. ’ ” “ aha ! ” cried poirot . “ and now we are in mid june ! all is solved ! ” i stared at him . “ you have no moneys in the bank of davenheim and salmon , _mon ami_ ? ”
christie	poirot	“ no , ” i said , wondering . “ why ? ” “ because i should advise you to withdraw it—before it is too late. ” “ why , what do you expect ? ” “ i expect a big smash in a few days—perhaps sooner . which reminds me , we will return the compliment of a _dépêche_ to japp . a pencil , i pray you , and a form . _voilà ! _ ‘ advise you to withdraw any money deposited with firm in question. ’ that will intrigue him , the good japp ! his eyes will open wide—wide ! he will not comprehend in the slightest—until to-morrow , or the next day ! ”
christie	poirot	i remained sceptical , but the morrow forced me to render tribute to my friend ’ s remarkable powers . in every paper was a huge headline telling of the sensational failure of the davenheim bank . the disappearance of the famous financier took on a totally different aspect in the light of the revelation of the financial affairs of the bank .
christie	poirot	before we were half-way through breakfast , the door flew open and japp rushed in . in his left hand was a paper ; in his right was poirot ’ s telegram , which he banged down on the table in front of my friend .
christie	poirot	“ how did you know , monsieur poirot ? how the blazes could you know ? ” poirot smiled placidly at him . “ ah , _mon ami_ , after your wire , it was a certainty ! from the commencement , see you , it struck me that the safe burglary was somewhat remarkable . jewels , ready money , bearer bonds—all so conveniently arranged for—whom ? well , the good monsieur davenheim was of those who ‘ look after number one ’ as your saying goes ! it seemed almost certain that it was arranged for—himself ! then his passion of late years for buying jewellery ! how simple ! the funds he embezzled , he converted into jewels , very likely replacing them in turn with paste duplicates , and so he put away in a safe place , under another name , a considerable fortune to be enjoyed all in good time when every one has been thrown off the track . his arrangements completed , he makes an appointment with mr. lowen ( who has been imprudent enough in the past to cross the great man once or twice ) , drills a hole in the safe , leaves orders that the guest is to be shown into the study , and walks out of the house—where ? ” poirot stopped , and stretched out his hand for another boiled egg . he frowned . “ it is really insupportable , ” he murmured , “ that every hen lays an egg of a different size ! what symmetry can there be on the breakfast table ? at least they should sort them in dozens at the shop ! ”
christie	poirot	“ never mind the eggs , ” said japp impatiently . “ let ’ em lay ’ em square if they like . tell us where our customer went to when he left the cedars—that is , if you know ! ”
christie	poirot	“ _eh bien_ , he went to his hiding-place . ah , this monsieur davenheim , there may be some malformation in his grey cells , but they are of the first quality ! ” “ do you know where he is hiding ? ”
christie	poirot	“ certainly ! it is most ingenious. ” “ for the lord ’ s sake , tell us , then ! ” poirot gently collected every fragment of shell from his plate , placed them in the egg-cup , and reversed the empty egg-shell on top of them . this little operation concluded , he smiled on the neat effect , and then beamed affectionately on us both .
christie	poirot	“ come , my friends , you are men of intelligence . ask yourselves the question which i asked myself . ‘ if i were this man , where should _i_ hide ? ’ hastings , what do you say ? ”
christie	poirot	“ well , ” i said , “ i ’ m rather inclined to think i ’ d not do a bolt at all . i ’ d stay in london—in the heart of things , travel by tubes and buses ; ten to one i ’ d never be recognized . there ’ s safety in a crowd . ”
christie	poirot	poirot turned inquiringly to japp . “ i don ’ t agree . get clear away at once—that ’ s the only chance . i would have had plenty of time to prepare things beforehand . i ’ d have a yacht waiting , with steam up , and i ’ d be off to one of the most out-of-the-way corners of the world before the hue and cry began ! ”
christie	poirot	we both looked at poirot . “ what do _you_ say , monsieur ? ” for a moment he remained silent . then a very curious smile flitted across his face . “ my friends , if _i_ were hiding from the police , do you know _where_ i should hide ? _in a prison ! _ ”
christie	poirot	“ _what ? _ ” “ you are seeking monsieur davenheim in order to put him in prison , so you never dream of looking to see if he may not be already there ! ” “ what do you mean ? ”
christie	poirot	“ you tell me madame davenheim is not a very intelligent woman . nevertheless i think that if you took her to bow street and confronted her with the man billy kellett , she would recognize him ! in spite of the fact that he has shaved his beard and moustache and those bushy eyebrows , and has cropped his hair close . a woman nearly always knows her husband , though the rest of the world may be deceived ! ”
christie	poirot	“ billy kellett ? but he ’ s known to the police ! ” “ did i not tell you davenheim was a clever man ? he prepared his alibi long beforehand . he was not in buenos ayres last autumn—he was creating the character of billy kellett , ‘ doing three months , ’ so that the police should have no suspicions when the time came . he was playing , remember , for a large fortune , as well as liberty . it was worth while doing the thing thoroughly . only—— ”
christie	poirot	“ yes ? ” “ _eh bien_ , afterwards he had to wear a false beard and wig , had to _make up as himself_ again , and to sleep with a false beard is not easy—it invites detection ! he can not risk continuing to share the chamber of madame his wife . you found out for me that for the last six months , or ever since his supposed return from buenos ayres , he and mrs. davenheim occupied separate rooms . then i was sure ! everything fitted in . the gardener who fancied he saw his master going round to the side of the house was quite right . he went to the boathouse , donned his ‘ tramp ’ clothes , which you may be sure had been safely hidden from the eyes of his valet , dropped the others in the lake , and proceeded to carry out his plan by pawning the ring in an obvious manner , and then assaulting a policeman , getting himself safely into the haven of bow street , where nobody would ever dream of looking for him ! ”
christie	poirot	“ it ’ s impossible , ” murmured japp . “ ask madame , ” said my friend , smiling . the next day a registered letter lay beside poirot ’ s plate . he opened it , and a five-pound note fluttered out . my friend ’ s brow puckered .
christie	poirot	“ _ah , sacré ! _ but what shall i do with it ? i have much remorse ! _ce pauvre japp_ ! ah , an idea ! we will have a little dinner , we three ! that consoles me . it was really too easy . i am ashamed . i , who would not rob a child—_mille tonnerres ! mon ami_ , what have you , that you laugh so heartily ? ”
christie	poirot	x the adventure of the italian nobleman poirot and i had many friends and acquaintances of an informal nature . amongst these was to be numbered dr. hawker , a near neighbour of ours , and a member of the medical profession . it was the genial doctor ’ s habit to drop in sometimes of an evening and have a chat with poirot , of whose genius he was an ardent admirer . the doctor himself , frank and unsuspicious to the last degree , admired the talents so far removed from his own .
christie	poirot	on one particular evening in early june , he arrived about half-past eight and settled down to a comfortable discussion on the cheery topic of the prevalence of arsenical poisoning in crimes . it must have been about a quarter of an hour later when the door of our sitting-room flew open , and a distracted female precipitated herself into the room .
christie	poirot	“ oh , doctor , you ’ re wanted ! such a terrible voice . it gave me a turn , it did indeed. ” i recognized in our new visitor dr. hawker ’ s housekeeper , miss rider . the doctor was a bachelor , and lived in a gloomy old house a few streets away . the usually placid miss rider was now in a state bordering on incoherence .
christie	poirot	“ what terrible voice ? who is it , and what ’ s the trouble ? ” “ it was the telephone , doctor . i answered it—and a voice spoke . ‘ help , ’ it said . ‘ doctor—help . they ’ ve killed me ! ’ then it sort of tailed away . ‘ who ’ s speaking ? ’ i said . ‘ who ’ s speaking ? ’ then i got a reply , just a whisper , it seemed , ‘ foscatine ’ —something like that— ‘ regent ’ s court . ’ ”
christie	poirot	the doctor uttered an exclamation . “ count foscatini . he has a flat in regent ’ s court . i must go at once . what can have happened ? ” “ a patient of yours ? ” asked poirot . “ i attended him for some slight ailment a few weeks ago . an italian , but he speaks english perfectly . well , i must wish you good night , monsieur poirot , unless—— ” he hesitated .
christie	poirot	“ i perceive the thought in your mind , ” said poirot , smiling . “ i shall be delighted to accompany you . hastings , run down and get hold of a taxi. ” taxis always make themselves sought for when one is particularly pressed for time , but i captured one at last , and we were soon bowling along in the direction of regent ’ s park . regent ’ s court was a new block of flats , situated just off st. john ’ s wood road . they had only recently been built , and contained the latest service devices .
christie	poirot	there was no one in the hall . the doctor pressed the lift-bell impatiently , and when the lift arrived questioned the uniformed attendant sharply . “ flat ii . count foscatini . there ’ s been an accident there , i understand . ”
christie	poirot	the man stared at him . “ first i ’ ve heard of it . mr. graves—that ’ s count foscatini ’ s man—went out about half an hour ago , and he said nothing. ” “ is the count alone in the flat ? ”
christie	poirot	“ no , sir , he ’ s got two gentlemen dining with him. ” “ what are they like ? ” i asked eagerly . we were in the lift now , ascending rapidly to the second floor , on which flat ii was situated .
christie	poirot	“ i didn ’ t see them myself , sir , but i understand that they were foreign gentlemen. ” he pulled back the iron door , and we stepped out on the landing . no . ii was opposite to us . the doctor rang the bell . there was no reply , and we could hear no sound from within . the doctor rang again and again ; we could hear the bell trilling within , but no sign of life rewarded us .
christie	poirot	“ this is getting serious , ” muttered the doctor . he turned to the lift attendant . “ is there any pass-key to this door ? ” “ there is one in the porter ’ s office downstairs. ” “ get it , then , and , look here , i think you ’ d better send for the police . ”
christie	poirot	poirot approved with a nod of the head . the man returned shortly ; with him came the manager . “ will you tell me , gentlemen , what is the meaning of all this ? ” “ certainly . i received a telephone message from count foscatini stating that he had been attacked and was dying . you can understand that we must lose no time—if we are not already too late . ”
christie	poirot	the manager produced the key without more ado , and we all entered the flat . we passed first into a small square lounge hall . a door on the right of it was half open . the manager indicated it with a nod .
christie	poirot	“ the dining-room. ” dr. hawker led the way . we followed close on his heels . as we entered the room i gave a gasp . the round table in the centre bore the remains of a meal ; three chairs were pushed back , as though their occupants had just risen . in the corner , to the right of the fire-place , was a big writing-table , and sitting at it was a man—or what had been a man . his right hand still grasped the base of the telephone , but he had fallen forward , struck down by a terrific blow on the head from behind . the weapon was not far to seek . a marble statuette stood where it had been hurriedly put down , the base of it stained with blood .
christie	poirot	the doctor ’ s examination did not take a minute . “ stone dead . must have been almost instantaneous . i wonder he even managed to telephone . it will be better not to move him until the police arrive . ”
christie	poirot	on the manager ’ s suggestion we searched the flat , but the result was a foregone conclusion . it was not likely that the murderers would be concealed there when all they had to do was to walk out .
christie	poirot	we came back to the dining-room . poirot had not accompanied us in our tour . i found him studying the centre table with close attention . i joined him . it was a well-polished round mahogany table . a bowl of roses decorated the centre , and white lace mats reposed on the gleaming surface . there was a dish of fruit , but the three dessert plates were untouched . there were three coffee-cups with remains of coffee in them—two black , one with milk . all three men had taken port , and the decanter , half-full , stood before the centre plate . one of the men had smoked a cigar , the other two cigarettes . a tortoiseshell-and-silver box , holding cigars and cigarettes , stood open upon the table .
christie	poirot	i enumerated all these facts to myself , but i was forced to admit that they did not shed any brilliant light on the situation . i wondered what poirot saw in them to make him so intent . i asked him .
christie	poirot	“ _mon ami_ , ” he replied , “ you miss the point . i am looking for something that i do _not_ see. ” “ what is that ? ” “ a mistake—even a little mistake—on the part of the murderer . ”
christie	poirot	he stepped swiftly to the small adjoining kitchen , looked in , and shook his head . “ monsieur , ” he said to the manager , “ explain to me , i pray , your system of serving meals here . ”
christie	poirot	the manager stepped to a small hatch in the wall . “ this is the service lift , ” he explained . “ it runs to the kitchens at the top of the building . you order through this telephone , and the dishes are sent down in the lift , one course at a time . the dirty plates and dishes are sent up in the same manner . no domestic worries , you understand , and at the same time you avoid the wearying publicity of always dining in a restaurant . ”
christie	poirot	poirot nodded . “ then the plates and dishes that were used to-night are on high in the kitchen . you permit that i mount there ? ” “ oh , certainly , if you like ! roberts , the lift man , will take you up and introduce you ; but i ’ m afraid you won ’ t find anything that ’ s of any use . they ’ re handling hundreds of plates and dishes , and they ’ ll be all lumped together . ”
christie	poirot	poirot remained firm , however , and together we visited the kitchens and questioned the man who had taken the order from flat ii . “ the order was given from the _à la carte menu_—for three , ” he explained . “ soup julienne , filet de sole normande , tournedos of beef , and a rice soufflé . what time ? just about eight o ’ clock , i should say . no , i ’ m afraid the plates and dishes have been all washed up by now . unfortunate . you were thinking of finger-prints , i suppose ? ”
christie	poirot	“ not exactly , ” said poirot , with an enigmatical smile . “ i am more interested in count foscatini ’ s appetite . did he partake of every dish ? ” “ yes ; but of course i can ’ t say how much of each he ate . the plates were all soiled , and the dishes empty—that is to say , with the exception of the rice soufflé . there was a fair amount of that left . ”
christie	poirot	“ ah ! ” said poirot , and seemed satisfied with the fact . as we descended to the flat again he remarked in a low tone : “ we have decidedly to do with a man of method . ”
christie	poirot	“ do you mean the murderer , or count foscatini ? ” “ the latter was undoubtedly an orderly gentleman . after imploring help and announcing his approaching demise , he carefully hung up the telephone receiver . ”
christie	poirot	i stared at poirot . his words now and his recent inquiries gave me the glimmering of an idea . “ you suspect poison ? ” i breathed . “ the blow on the head was a blind . ”
christie	poirot	poirot merely smiled . we re-entered the flat to find the local inspector of police had arrived with two constables . he was inclined to resent our appearance , but poirot calmed him with the mention of our scotland yard friend , inspector japp , and we were accorded a grudging permission to remain . it was a lucky thing we were , for we had not been back five minutes before an agitated middle-aged man came rushing into the room with every appearance of grief and agitation .
christie	poirot	this was graves , valet-butler to the late count foscatini . the story he had to tell was a sensational one . on the previous morning , two gentlemen had called to see his master . they were italians , and the elder of the two , a man of about forty , gave his name as signor ascanio . the younger was a well-dressed lad of about twenty-four .
christie	poirot	count foscatini was evidently prepared for their visit and immediately sent graves out upon some trivial errand . here the man paused and hesitated in his story . in the end , however , he admitted that , curious as to the purport of the interview , he had not obeyed immediately , but had lingered about endeavouring to hear something of what was going on .
christie	poirot	the conversation was carried on in so low a tone that he was not as successful as he had hoped ; but he gathered enough to make it clear that some kind of monetary proposition was being discussed , and that the basis of it was a threat . the discussion was anything but amicable . in the end , count foscatini raised his voice slightly , and the listener heard these words clearly :
christie	poirot	“ i have no time to argue further now , gentlemen . if you will dine with me to-morrow night at eight o ’ clock , we will resume the discussion. ” afraid of being discovered listening , graves had then hurried out to do his master ’ s errand . this evening the two men had arrived punctually at eight . during dinner they had talked of indifferent matters—politics , the weather , and the theatrical world . when graves had placed the port upon the table and brought in the coffee his master told him that he might have the evening off .
christie	poirot	“ was that a usual proceeding of his when he had guests ? ” asked the inspector . “ no , sir ; it wasn ’ t . that ’ s what made me think it must be some business of a very unusual kind that he was going to discuss with these gentlemen . ”
christie	poirot	that finished graves ’ s story . he had gone out about 8.30 , and , meeting a friend , had accompanied him to the metropolitan music hall in edgware road . nobody had seen the two men leave , but the time of the murder was fixed clearly enough at 8.47 . a small clock on the writing-table had been swept off by foscatini ’ s arm , and had stopped at that hour , which agreed with miss rider ’ s telephone summons .
christie	poirot	the police surgeon had made his examination of the body , and it was now lying on the couch . i saw the face for the first time—the olive complexion , the long nose , the luxuriant black moustache , and the full red lips drawn back from the dazzlingly white teeth . not altogether a pleasant face .
christie	poirot	“ well , ” said the inspector , refastening his notebook . “ the case seems clear enough . the only difficulty will be to lay our hands on this signor ascanio . i suppose his address is not in the dead man ’ s pocket-book by any chance ? ”
christie	poirot	as poirot had said , the late foscatini was an orderly man . neatly written in small , precise handwriting was the inscription , “ signor paolo ascanio , grosvenor hotel. ” the inspector busied himself with the telephone , then turned to us with a grin .
christie	poirot	“ just in time . our fine gentleman was off to catch the boat train to the continong . well , gentlemen , that ’ s about all we can do here . it ’ s a bad business , but straightforward enough . one of these italian vendetta things , as likely as not . ”
christie	poirot	thus airily dismissed , we found our way downstairs . dr. hawker was full of excitement . “ like the beginning of a novel , eh ? real exciting stuff . wouldn ’ t believe it if you read about it . ”
christie	poirot	poirot did not speak . he was very thoughtful . all the evening he had hardly opened his lips . “ what says the master detective , eh ? ” asked hawker , clapping him on the back . “ nothing to work your grey cells over this time . ”
christie	poirot	“ you think not ? ” “ what could there be ? ” “ well , for example , there is the window. ” “ the window ? but it was fastened . nobody could have got out or in that way . i noticed it specially . ”
christie	poirot	“ and why were you able to notice it ? ” the doctor looked puzzled . poirot hastened to explain . “ it is to the curtains i refer . they were not drawn . a little odd , that . and then there was the coffee . it was very black coffee . ”
christie	poirot	“ well , what of it ? ” “ very black , ” repeated poirot . “ in conjunction with that let us remember that very little of the rice soufflé was eaten , and we get—what ? ” “ moonshine , ” laughed the doctor . “ you ’ re pulling my leg . ”
christie	poirot	“ never do i pull the leg . hastings here knows that i am perfectly serious. ” “ i don ’ t know what you are getting at , all the same , ” i confessed . “ you don ’ t suspect the manservant , do you ? he might have been in with the gang , and put some dope in the coffee . i suppose they ’ ll test his alibi ? ”
christie	poirot	“ without doubt , my friend ; but it is the alibi of signor ascanio that interests me. ” “ you think he has an alibi ? ” “ that is just what worries me . i have no doubt that we shall soon be enlightened on that point . ”
christie	poirot	the _daily newsmonger_ enabled us to become conversant with succeeding events . signor ascanio was arrested and charged with the murder of count foscatini . when arrested , he denied knowing the count , and declared he had never been near regent ’ s court either on the evening of the crime or on the previous morning . the younger man had disappeared entirely . signor ascanio had arrived alone at the grosvenor hotel from the continent two days before the murder . all efforts to trace the second man failed .
christie	poirot	ascanio , however , was not sent for trial . no less a personage than the italian ambassador himself came forward and testified at the police-court proceedings that ascanio had been with him at the embassy from eight till nine that evening . the prisoner was discharged . naturally , a lot of people thought that the crime was a political one , and was being deliberately hushed up .
christie	poirot	poirot had taken a keen interest in all these points . nevertheless , i was somewhat surprised when he suddenly informed me one morning that he was expecting a visitor at eleven o ’ clock , and that that visitor was none other than ascanio himself .
christie	poirot	“ he wishes to consult you ? ” “ _du tout_ , hastings . i wish to consult him. ” “ what about ? ” “ the regent ’ s court murder. ” “ you are going to prove that he did it ? ” “ a man can not be tried twice for murder , hastings . endeavour to have the common sense . ah , that is our friend ’ s ring . ”
christie	poirot	a few minutes later signor ascanio was ushered in—a small , thin man with a secretive and furtive glance in his eyes . he remained standing , darting suspicious glances from one to the other of us .
christie	poirot	“ monsieur poirot ? ” my little friend tapped himself gently on the chest . “ be seated , signor . you received my note . i am determined to get to the bottom of this mystery . in some small measure you can aid me . let us commence . you—in company with a friend—visited the late count foscatini on the morning of tuesday the 9th—— ”
christie	poirot	the italian made an angry gesture . “ i did nothing of the sort . i have sworn in court—— ” “ _précisément_—and i have a little idea that you have sworn falsely. ” “ you threaten me ? bah ! i have nothing to fear from you . i have been acquitted . ”
christie	poirot	“ exactly ; and as i am not an imbecile , it is not with the gallows i threaten you—but with publicity . publicity ! i see that you do not like the word . i had an idea that you would not . my little ideas , you know , they are very valuable to me . come , signor , your only chance is to be frank with me . i do not ask to know whose indiscretions brought you to england . i know this much , you came for the especial purpose of seeing count foscatini . ”
christie	poirot	“ he was not a count , ” growled the italian . “ i have already noted the fact that his name does not appear in the _almanach de gotha_ . never mind , the title of count is often useful in the profession of blackmailing . ”
christie	poirot	“ i suppose i might as well be frank . you seem to know a good deal. ” “ i have employed my grey cells to some advantage . come , signor ascanio , you visited the dead man on the tuesday morning—that is so , is it not ? ”
christie	poirot	“ yes ; but i never went there on the following evening . there was no need . i will tell you all . certain information concerning a man of great position in italy had come into this scoundrel ’ s possession . he demanded a big sum of money in return for the papers . i came over to england to arrange the matter . i called upon him by appointment that morning . one of the young secretaries of the embassy was with me . the count was more reasonable than i had hoped , although even then the sum of money i paid him was a huge one . ”
christie	poirot	“ pardon , how was it paid ? ” “ in italian notes of comparatively small denomination . i paid over the money then and there . he handed me the incriminating papers . i never saw him again . ”
christie	poirot	“ why did you not say all this when you were arrested ? ” “ in my delicate position i was forced to deny any association with the man. ” “ and how do you account for the events of the evening , then ? ”
christie	poirot	“ i can only think that some one must have deliberately impersonated me . i understand that no money was found in the flat. ” poirot looked at him and shook his head .
christie	poirot	“ strange , ” he murmured . “ we all have the little grey cells . and so few of us know how to use them . good morning , signor ascanio . i believe your story . it is very much as i had imagined . but i had to make sure . ”
christie	poirot	after bowing his guest out , poirot returned to his arm-chair and smiled at me . “ let us hear m. le capitaine hastings on the case ? ” “ well , i suppose ascanio is right—somebody impersonated him . ”
christie	poirot	“ never , never will you use the brains the good god has given you . recall to yourself some words i uttered after leaving the flat that night . i referred to the window-curtains not being drawn . we are in the month of june . it is still light at eight o ’ clock . the light is failing by half-past . _ça vous dit quelque chose ? _ i perceive a struggling impression that you will arrive some day . now let us continue . the coffee was , as i said , very black . count foscatini ’ s teeth were magnificently white . coffee stains the teeth . we reason from that that count foscatini did not drink any coffee . yet there was coffee in all three cups . why should anyone pretend count foscatini had drunk coffee when he had not done so ? ”
christie	poirot	i shook my head , utterly bewildered . “ come , i will help you . what evidence have we that ascanio and his friend , or two men posing as them , ever came to the flat that night ? nobody saw them go in ; nobody saw them go out . we have the evidence of one man and of a host of inanimate objects . ”
christie	poirot	“ you mean ? ” “ i mean knives and forks and plates and empty dishes . ah , but it was a clever idea ! graves is a thief and a scoundrel , but what a man of method ! he overhears a portion of the conversation in the morning , enough to realize that ascanio will be in awkward position to defend himself . the following evening , about eight o ’ clock , he tells his master he is wanted at the telephone . foscatini sits down , stretches out his hand to the telephone , and from behind graves strikes him down with the marble figure . then quickly to the service telephone—dinner for three ! it comes , he lays the table , dirties the plates , knives , and forks , etc . but he has to get rid of the food too . not only is he a man of brain ; he has a resolute and capacious stomach ! but after eating three tournedos , the rice soufflé is too much for him ! he even smokes a cigar and two cigarettes to carry out the illusion . ah , but it was magnificently thorough ! then , having moved on the hands of the clock to 8.47 , he smashes it and stops it . the one thing he does not do is to draw the curtains . but if there had been a real dinner party the curtains would have been drawn as soon as the light began to fail . then he hurries out , mentioning the guests to the lift man in passing . he hurries to a telephone box , and as near as possible to 8.47 rings up the doctor with his master ’ s dying cry . so successful is his idea that no one ever inquires if a call was put through from flat ii at that time . ”
christie	poirot	“ except hercule poirot , i suppose ? ” i said sarcastically . “ not even hercule poirot , ” said my friend , with a smile . “ i am about to inquire now . i had to prove my point to you first . but you will see , i shall be right ; and then japp , to whom i have already given a hint , will be able to arrest the respectable graves . i wonder how much of the money he has spent . ”
christie	poirot	poirot _was_ right . he always is , confound him ! xi the case of the missing will the problem presented to us by miss violet marsh made rather a pleasant change from our usual routine work . poirot had received a brisk and business-like note from the lady asking for an appointment , and he had replied asking her to call upon him at eleven o ’ clock the following day .
christie	poirot	she arrived punctually—a tall , handsome young woman , plainly but neatly dressed , with an assured and business-like manner . clearly a young woman who meant to get on in the world . i am not a great admirer of the so-called new woman myself , and , in spite of her good looks , i was not particularly prepossessed in her favour .
christie	poirot	“ my business is of a somewhat unusual nature , monsieur poirot , ” she began , after she had accepted a chair . “ i had better begin at the beginning and tell you the whole story . ”
christie	poirot	“ if you please , mademoiselle. ” “ i am an orphan . my father was one of two brothers , sons of a small yeoman farmer in devonshire . the farm was a poor one , and the elder brother , andrew , emigrated to australia , where he did very well indeed , and by means of successful speculation in land became a very rich man . the younger brother , roger ( my father ) , had no leanings towards the agricultural life . he managed to educate himself a little , and obtained a post as a clerk with a small firm . he married slightly above him ; my mother was the daughter of a poor artist . my father died when i was six years old . when i was fourteen , my mother followed him to the grave . my only living relation then was my uncle andrew , who had recently returned from australia and bought a small place , crabtree manor , in his native county . he was exceedingly kind to his brother ’ s orphan child , took me to live with him , and treated me in every way as though i was his own daughter .
christie	poirot	“ crabtree manor , in spite of its name , is really only an old farmhouse . farming was in my uncle ’ s blood , and he was intensely interested in various modern farming experiments . although kindness itself to me , he had certain peculiar and deeply-rooted ideas as to the up-bringing of women . himself a man of little or no education , though possessing remarkable shrewdness , he placed little value on what he called ‘ book knowledge. ’ he was especially opposed to the education of women . in his opinion , girls should learn practical housework and dairy-work , be useful about the home , and have as little to do with book learning as possible . he proposed to bring me up on these lines , to my bitter disappointment and annoyance . i rebelled frankly . i knew that i possessed a good brain , and had absolutely no talent for domestic duties . my uncle and i had many bitter arguments on the subject , for , though much attached to each other , we were both self-willed . i was lucky enough to win a scholarship , and up to a certain point was successful in getting my own way . the crisis arose when i resolved to go to girton . i had a little money of my own , left me by my mother , and i was quite determined to make the best use of the gifts god had given me . i had one long , final argument with my uncle . he put the facts plainly before me . he had no other relations , and he had intended me to be his sole heiress . as i have told you , he was a very rich man . if i persisted in these ‘ new-fangled notions ’ of mine , however , i need look for nothing from him . i remained polite , but firm . i should always be deeply attached to him , i told him , but i must lead my own life . we parted on that note . ‘ you fancy your brains , my girl , ’ were his last words . ‘ i ’ ve no book learning , but , for all that , i ’ ll pit mine against yours any day . we ’ ll see what we shall see . ’
christie	poirot	“ that was nine years ago . i have stayed with him for a week-end occasionally , and our relations were perfectly amicable , though his views remained unaltered . he never referred to my having matriculated , nor to my b.sc . for the last three years his health had been failing , and a month ago he died .
christie	poirot	“ i am now coming to the point of my visit . my uncle left a most extraordinary will . by its terms , crabtree manor and its contents are to be at my disposal for a year from his death— ‘ during which time my clever niece may prove her wits , ’ the actual words run . at the end of that period , ‘ my wits having proved better than hers , ’ the house and all my uncle ’ s large fortune pass to various charitable institutions . ”
christie	poirot	“ that is a little hard on you , mademoiselle , seeing that you were mr. marsh ’ s only blood relation. ” “ i do not look on it in that way . uncle andrew warned me fairly , and i chose my own path . since i would not fall in with his wishes , he was at perfect liberty to leave his money to whom he pleased . ”
christie	poirot	“ was the will drawn up by a lawyer ? ” “ no ; it was written on a printed will-form and witnessed by the man and his wife who live in the house and do for my uncle . ”
christie	poirot	“ there might be a possibility of upsetting such a will ? ” “ i would not even attempt to do such a thing. ” “ you regard it , then , as a sporting challenge on the part of your uncle ? ”
christie	poirot	“ that is exactly how i look upon it. ” “ it bears that interpretation , certainly , ” said poirot thoughtfully . “ somewhere in this rambling old manor-house your uncle has concealed either a sum of money in notes or possibly a second will , and has given you a year in which to exercise your ingenuity to find it . ”
christie	poirot	“ exactly , monsieur poirot ; and i am paying you the compliment of assuming that your ingenuity will be greater than mine. ” “ eh , eh ! but that is very charming of you . my grey cells are at your disposal . you have made no search yourself ? ”
christie	poirot	“ only a cursory one ; but i have too much respect for my uncle ’ s undoubted abilities to fancy that the task will be an easy one. ” “ have you the will or a copy of it with you ? ”
christie	poirot	miss marsh handed a document across the table . poirot ran through it , nodding to himself . “ made three years ago . dated march 25 ; and the time is given also—11 a.m.—that is very suggestive . it narrows the field of search . assuredly it is another will we have to seek for . a will made even half-an-hour later would upset this . _eh bien_ , mademoiselle , it is a problem charming and ingenious that you have presented to me here . i shall have all the pleasure in the world in solving it for you . granted that your uncle was a man of ability , his grey cells can not have been of the quality of hercule poirot ’ s ! ”
christie	poirot	( really , poirot ’ s vanity is blatant ! ) “ fortunately , i have nothing of moment on hand at the minute . hastings and i will go down to crabtree manor to-night . the man and wife who attended on your uncle are still there , i presume ? ”
christie	poirot	“ yes , their name is baker. ” • • • • • • • the following morning saw us started on the hunt proper . we had arrived late the night before . mr. and mrs. baker , having received a telegram from miss marsh , were expecting us . they were a pleasant couple , the man gnarled and pink-cheeked , like a shrivelled pippin , and his wife a woman of vast proportions and true devonshire calm .
christie	poirot	tired with our journey and the eight-mile drive from the station , we had retired at once to bed after a supper of roast chicken , apple pie , and devonshire cream . we had now disposed of an excellent breakfast , and were sitting in a small panelled room which had been the late mr. marsh ’ s study and living-room . a roll-top desk stuffed with papers , all neatly docketed , stood against the wall , and a big leather armchair showed plainly that it had been its owner ’ s constant resting-place . a big chintz-covered settee ran along the opposite wall , and the deep low window seats were covered with the same faded chintz of an old-fashioned pattern .
christie	poirot	“ _eh bien , mon ami_ , ” said poirot , lighting one of his tiny cigarettes , “ we must map out our plan of campaign . already i have made a rough survey of the house , but i am of opinion that any clue will be found in this room . we shall have to go through the documents in the desk with meticulous care . naturally , i do not expect to find the will amongst them ; but it is likely that some apparently innocent paper may conceal the clue to its hiding-place . but first we must have a little information . ring the bell , i pray of you . ”
christie	poirot	i did so . while we were waiting for it to be answered , poirot walked up and down , looking about him approvingly . “ a man of method this mr. marsh . see how neatly the packets of papers are docketed ; then the key to each drawer has its ivory label—so has the key of the china cabinet on the wall ; and see with what precision the china within is arranged . it rejoices the heart . nothing here offends the eye—— ”
christie	poirot	he came to an abrupt pause , as his eye was caught by the key of the desk itself , to which a dirty envelope was affixed . poirot frowned at it and withdrew it from the lock . on it were scrawled the words : “ key of roll top desk , ” in a crabbed handwriting , quite unlike the neat superscriptions on the other keys .
christie	poirot	“ an alien note , ” said poirot , frowning . “ i could swear that here we have no longer the personality of mr. marsh . but who else has been in the house ? only miss marsh , and she , if i mistake not , is also a young lady of method and order . ”
christie	poirot	baker came in answer to the bell . “ will you fetch madame your wife , and answer a few questions ? ” baker departed , and in a few moments returned with mrs. baker , wiping her hands on her apron and beaming all over her face .
christie	poirot	in a few clear words poirot set forth the object of his mission . the bakers were immediately sympathetic . “ us don ’ t want to see miss violet done out of what ’ s hers , ” declared the woman . “ cruel hard ’ twould be for hospitals to get it all . ”
christie	poirot	poirot proceeded with his questions . yes , mr. and mrs. baker remembered perfectly witnessing the will . baker had previously been sent into the neighbouring town to get two printed will-forms . “ two ? ” said poirot sharply .
christie	poirot	“ yes , sir , for safety like , i suppose , in case he should spoil one—and sure enough , so he did do . us had signed one—— ” “ what time of day was that ? ” baker scratched his head , but his wife was quicker .
christie	poirot	“ why , to be sure , i ’ d just put the milk on for the cocoa at eleven . don ’ t ee remember ? it had all boiled over on the stove when us got back to kitchen . ”
christie	poirot	“ and afterwards ? ” “ ’ twould be about an hour later . us had to go in again . ‘ i ’ ve made a mistake , ’ says old master , ‘ had to tear the whole thing up . i ’ ll trouble you to sign again , ’ and us did . and afterwards master give us a tidy sum of money each . ‘ i ’ ve left you nothing in my will , ’ says he , ‘ but each year i live you ’ ll have this to be a nest-egg when i ’ m gone ’ ; and sure enough , so he did . ”
christie	poirot	poirot reflected . “ after you had signed the second time , what did mr. marsh do ? do you know ? ” “ went out to the village to pay tradesmen ’ s books. ” that did not seem very promising . poirot tried another tack . he held out the key of the desk .
christie	poirot	“ is that your master ’ s writing ? ” i may have imagined it , but i fancied that a moment or two elapsed before baker replied : “ yes , sir , it is. ” “ he ’ s lying , ” i thought . “ but why ? ”
christie	poirot	“ has your master let the house ? —have there been any strangers in it during the last three years ? ” “ no , sir. ” “ no visitors ? ” “ only miss violet. ” “ no strangers of any kind been inside this room ? ”
christie	poirot	“ no , sir. ” “ you forget the workmen , jim , ” his wife reminded him . “ workmen ? ” poirot wheeled round on her . “ what workmen ? ” the woman explained that about two years and a half ago workmen had been in the house to do certain repairs . she was quite vague as to what the repairs were . her view seemed to be that the whole thing was a fad of her master ’ s and quite unnecessary . part of the time the workmen had been in the study ; but what they had done there she could not say , as her master had not let either of them into the room whilst the work was in progress . unfortunately , they could not remember the name of the firm employed , beyond the fact that it was a plymouth one .
christie	poirot	“ we progress , hastings , ” said poirot , rubbing his hands as the bakers left the room . “ clearly he made a second will and then had workmen from plymouth in to make a suitable hiding-place . instead of wasting time taking up the floor and tapping the walls , we will go to plymouth . ”
christie	poirot	with a little trouble , we were able to get the information we wanted . after one or two essays , we found the firm employed by mr. marsh . their employees had all been with them many years , and it was easy to find the two men who had worked under mr. marsh ’ s orders . they remembered the job perfectly . amongst various other minor jobs , they had taken up one of the bricks of the old-fashioned fireplace , made a cavity beneath , and so cut the brick that it was impossible to see the join . by pressing on the second brick from the end , the whole thing was raised . it had been quite a complicated piece of work , and the old gentleman had been very fussy about it . our informant was a man called coghan , a big , gaunt man with a grizzled moustache . he seemed an intelligent fellow .
christie	poirot	we returned to crabtree manor in high spirits , and , locking the study door , proceeded to put our newly acquired knowledge into effect . it was impossible to see any sign on the bricks , but when we pressed in the manner indicated , a deep cavity was at once disclosed .
christie	poirot	eagerly poirot plunged in his hand . suddenly his face fell from complacent elation to consternation . all he held was a charred fragment of stiff paper . but for it , the cavity was empty .
christie	poirot	“ _sacré ! _ ” cried poirot angrily . “ some one has been before us. ” we examined the scrap of paper anxiously . clearly it was a fragment of what we sought . a portion of baker ’ s signature remained , but no indication of what the terms of the will had been .
christie	poirot	poirot sat back on his heels . his expression would have been comical if we had not been so overcome . “ i understand it not , ” he growled . “ who destroyed this ? and what was their object ? ”
christie	poirot	“ the bakers ? ” i suggested . “ _pourquoi ? _ neither will makes any provision for them , and they are more likely to be kept on with miss marsh than if the place became the property of a hospital . how could it be to anyone ’ s advantage to destroy the will ? the hospitals benefit—yes ; but one can not suspect institutions . ”
christie	poirot	“ perhaps the old man changed his mind and destroyed it himself , ” i suggested . poirot rose to his feet , dusting his knees with his usual care . “ that may be , ” he admitted . “ one of your more sensible observations , hastings . well , we can do no more here . we have done all that mortal man can do . we have successfully pitted our wits against the late andrew marsh ’ s ; but , unfortunately , his niece is no better off for our success . ”
christie	poirot	by driving to the station at once , we were just able to catch a train to london , though not the principal express . poirot was sad and dissatisfied . for my part , i was tired and dozed in a corner . suddenly , as we were just moving out of taunton , poirot uttered a piercing squeal .
christie	poirot	“ _vite_ , hastings ! awake and jump ! but jump i say ! ” before i knew where i was we were standing on the platform , bareheaded and minus our valises , whilst the train disappeared into the night . i was furious . but poirot paid no attention .
christie	poirot	“ imbecile that i have been ! ” he cried . “ triple imbecile ! not again will i vaunt my little grey cells ! ” “ that ’ s a good job at any rate , ” i said grumpily . “ but what is this all about ? ”
christie	poirot	as usual , when following out his own ideas , poirot paid absolutely no attention to me . “ the tradesmen ’ s books—i have left them entirely out of account ! yes , but where ? where ? never mind , i can not be mistaken . we must return at once . ”
christie	poirot	easier said than done . we managed to get a slow train to exeter , and there poirot hired a car . we arrived back at crabtree manor in the small hours of the morning . i pass over the bewilderment of the bakers when we had at last aroused them . paying no attention to anybody , poirot strode at once to the study .
christie	poirot	“ i have been , not a triple imbecile , but thirty-six times one , my friend , ” he deigned to remark . “ now , behold ! ” going straight to the desk , he drew out the key , and detached the envelope from it . i stared at him stupidly . how could he possibly hope to find a big will-form in that tiny envelope ? with great care he cut open the envelope , laying it out flat . then he lighted the fire and held the plain inside surface of the envelope to the flame . in a few minutes faint characters began to appear .
christie	poirot	“ look , _mon ami_ ! ” cried poirot in triumph . i looked . there were just a few lines of faint writing stating briefly that he left everything to his niece , violet marsh . it was dated march 25 , 12.30 p.m. , and witnessed by albert pike , confectioner , and jessie pike , married woman .
christie	poirot	“ but is it legal ? ” i gasped . “ as far as i know , there is no law against writing your will in a blend of disappearing and sympathetic ink . the intention of the testator is clear , and the beneficiary is his only living relation . but the cleverness of him ! he foresaw every step that a searcher would take—that i , miserable imbecile , took . he gets two will-forms , makes the servants sign twice , then sallies out with his will written on the inside of a dirty envelope and a fountain-pen containing his little ink mixture . on some excuse he gets the confectioner and his wife to sign their names under his own signature , then he ties it to the key of his desk and chuckles to himself . if his niece sees through his little ruse , she will have justified her choice of life and elaborate education , and be thoroughly welcome to his money . ”
christie	poirot	“ she didn ’ t see through it , did she ? ” i said slowly . “ it seems rather unfair . the old man really won. ” “ but no , hastings . it is _your_ wits that go astray . miss marsh proved the astuteness of her wits and the value of the higher education for women by at once putting the matter in _my_ hands . always employ the expert . she has amply proved her right to the money . ”
christie	styles	“ well ? ” i inquired , as soon as we were protected from prying eyes by the leafy screen . with a sigh , cynthia flung herself down , and tossed off her hat . the sunlight , piercing through the branches , turned the auburn of her hair to quivering gold .
christie	styles	“ mr . hastings—you are always so kind , and you know such a lot. ” it struck me at this moment that cynthia was really a very charming girl ! much more charming than mary , who never said things of that kind .
christie	styles	“ well ? ” i asked benignantly , as she hesitated . “ i want to ask your advice . what shall i do ? ” “ do ? ” “ yes . you see , aunt emily always told me i should be provided for . i suppose she forgot , or didn ’ t think she was likely to die—anyway , i am _not_ provided for ! and i don ’ t know what to do . do you think i ought to go away from here at once ? ”
christie	styles	“ good heavens , no ! they don ’ t want to part with you , i ’ m sure. ” cynthia hesitated a moment , plucking up the grass with her tiny hands . then she said : “ mrs . cavendish does . she hates me . ”
christie	styles	“ hates you ? ” i cried , astonished . cynthia nodded . “ yes . i don ’ t know why , but she can ’ t bear me ; and _he_ can ’ t , either. ” “ there i know you ’ re wrong , ” i said warmly . “ on the contrary , john is very fond of you . ”
christie	styles	“ oh , yes—_john_ . i meant lawrence . not , of course , that i care whether lawrence hates me or not . still , it ’ s rather horrid when no one loves you , isn ’ t it ? ” “ but they do , cynthia dear , ” i said earnestly . “ i ’ m sure you are mistaken . look , there is john—and miss howard—— ”
christie	styles	cynthia nodded rather gloomily . “ yes , john likes me , i think , and of course evie , for all her gruff ways , wouldn ’ t be unkind to a fly . but lawrence never speaks to me if he can help it , and mary can hardly bring herself to be civil to me . she wants evie to stay on , is begging her to , but she doesn ’ t want me , and—and—i don ’ t know what to do. ” suddenly the poor child burst out crying .
christie	styles	i don ’ t know what possessed me . her beauty , perhaps , as she sat there , with the sunlight glinting down on her head ; perhaps the sense of relief at encountering someone who so obviously could have no connection with the tragedy ; perhaps honest pity for her youth and loneliness . anyway , i leant forward , and taking her little hand , i said awkwardly :
christie	styles	“ marry me , cynthia. ” unwittingly , i had hit upon a sovereign remedy for her tears . she sat up at once , drew her hand away , and said , with some asperity : “ don ’ t be silly ! ”
christie	styles	i was a little annoyed . “ i ’ m not being silly . i am asking you to do me the honour of becoming my wife. ” to my intense surprise , cynthia burst out laughing , and called me a “ funny dear . ”
christie	styles	“ it ’ s perfectly sweet of you , ” she said , “ but you know you don ’ t want to ! ” “ yes , i do . i ’ ve got—— ” “ never mind what you ’ ve got . you don ’ t really want to—and i don ’ t either . ”
christie	styles	“ well , of course , that settles it , ” i said stiffly . “ but i don ’ t see anything to laugh at . there ’ s nothing funny about a proposal. ” “ no , indeed , ” said cynthia . “ somebody might accept you next time . good-bye , you ’ ve cheered me up _very_ much . ”
christie	styles	and , with a final uncontrollable burst of merriment , she vanished through the trees . thinking over the interview , it struck me as being profoundly unsatisfactory . it occurred to me suddenly that i would go down to the village , and look up bauerstein . somebody ought to be keeping an eye on the fellow . at the same time , it would be wise to allay any suspicions he might have as to his being suspected . i remembered how poirot had relied on my diplomacy . accordingly , i went to the little house with the “ apartments ” card inserted in the window , where i knew he lodged , and tapped on the door .
christie	styles	an old woman came and opened it . “ good afternoon , ” i said pleasantly . “ is dr. bauerstein in ? ” she stared at me . “ haven ’ t you heard ? ” “ heard what ? ” “ about him. ” “ what about him ? ”
christie	styles	“ he ’ s took. ” “ took ? dead ? ” “ no , took by the perlice. ” “ by the police ! ” i gasped . “ do you mean they ’ ve arrested him ? ” “ yes , that ’ s it , and—— ” i waited to hear no more , but tore up the village to find poirot .
christie	styles	chapter x . the arrest to my extreme annoyance , poirot was not in , and the old belgian who answered my knock informed me that he believed he had gone to london .
christie	styles	i was dumbfounded . what on earth could poirot be doing in london ! was it a sudden decision on his part , or had he already made up his mind when he parted from me a few hours earlier ?
christie	styles	i retraced my steps to styles in some annoyance . with poirot away , i was uncertain how to act . had he foreseen this arrest ? had he not , in all probability , been the cause of it ? those questions i could not resolve . but in the meantime what was i to do ? should i announce the arrest openly at styles , or not ? though i did not acknowledge it to myself , the thought of mary cavendish was weighing on me . would it not be a terrible shock to her ? for the moment , i set aside utterly any suspicions of her . she could not be implicated—otherwise i should have heard some hint of it .
christie	styles	of course , there was no possibility of being able permanently to conceal dr. bauerstein ’ s arrest from her . it would be announced in every newspaper on the morrow . still , i shrank from blurting it out . if only poirot had been accessible , i could have asked his advice . what possessed him to go posting off to london in this unaccountable way ?
christie	styles	in spite of myself , my opinion of his sagacity was immeasurably heightened . i would never have dreamt of suspecting the doctor , had not poirot put it into my head . yes , decidedly , the little man was clever .
christie	styles	after some reflecting , i decided to take john into my confidence , and leave him to make the matter public or not , as he thought fit . he gave vent to a prodigious whistle , as i imparted the news .
christie	styles	“ great scott ! you _were_ right , then . i couldn ’ t believe it at the time. ” “ no , it is astonishing until you get used to the idea , and see how it makes everything fit in . now , what are we to do ? of course , it will be generally known to-morrow . ”
christie	styles	john reflected . “ never mind , ” he said at last , “ we won ’ t say anything at present . there is no need . as you say , it will be known soon enough. ” but to my intense surprise , on getting down early the next morning , and eagerly opening the newspapers , there was not a word about the arrest ! there was a column of mere padding about “ the styles poisoning case , ” but nothing further . it was rather inexplicable , but i supposed that , for some reason or other , japp wished to keep it out of the papers . it worried me just a little , for it suggested the possibility that there might be further arrests to come .
christie	styles	after breakfast , i decided to go down to the village , and see if poirot had returned yet ; but , before i could start , a well-known face blocked one of the windows , and the well-known voice said :
christie	styles	“ _bonjour , mon ami ! _ ” “ poirot , ” i exclaimed , with relief , and seizing him by both hands , i dragged him into the room . “ i was never so glad to see anyone . listen , i have said nothing to anybody but john . is that right ? ”
christie	styles	“ my friend , ” replied poirot , “ i do not know what you are talking about. ” “ dr . bauerstein ’ s arrest , of course , ” i answered impatiently . “ is bauerstein arrested , then ? ” “ did you not know it ? ”
christie	styles	“ not the least in the world. ” but , pausing a moment , he added : “ still , it does not surprise me . after all , we are only four miles from the coast. ” “ the coast ? ” i asked , puzzled . “ what has that got to do with it ? ”
christie	styles	poirot shrugged his shoulders . “ surely , it is obvious ! ” “ not to me . no doubt i am very dense , but i can not see what the proximity of the coast has got to do with the murder of mrs. inglethorp . ”
christie	styles	“ nothing at all , of course , ” replied poirot , smiling . “ but we were speaking of the arrest of dr. bauerstein. ” “ well , he is arrested for the murder of mrs. inglethorp—— ” “ what ? ” cried poirot , in apparently lively astonishment . “ dr . bauerstein arrested for the murder of mrs. inglethorp ? ”
christie	styles	“ yes. ” “ impossible ! that would be too good a farce ! who told you that , my friend ? ” “ well , no one exactly told me , ” i confessed . “ but he is arrested. ” “ oh , yes , very likely . but for espionage , _mon ami_ . ”
christie	styles	“ espionage ? ” i gasped . “ precisely. ” “ not for poisoning mrs. inglethorp ? ” “ not unless our friend japp has taken leave of his senses , ” replied poirot placidly . “ but—but i thought you thought so too ? ”
christie	styles	poirot gave me one look , which conveyed a wondering pity , and his full sense of the utter absurdity of such an idea . “ do you mean to say , ” i asked , slowly adapting myself to the new idea , “ that dr. bauerstein is a spy ? ”
christie	styles	poirot nodded . “ have you never suspected it ? ” “ it never entered my head. ” “ it did not strike you as peculiar that a famous london doctor should bury himself in a little village like this , and should be in the habit of walking about at all hours of the night , fully dressed ? ”
christie	styles	“ no , ” i confessed , “ i never thought of such a thing. ” “ he is , of course , a german by birth , ” said poirot thoughtfully , “ though he has practised so long in this country that nobody thinks of him as anything but an englishman . he was naturalized about fifteen years ago . a very clever man—a jew , of course . ”
christie	styles	“ the blackguard ! ” i cried indignantly . “ not at all . he is , on the contrary , a patriot . think what he stands to lose . i admire the man myself. ” but i could not look at it in poirot ’ s philosophical way .
christie	styles	“ and this is the man with whom mrs. cavendish has been wandering about all over the country ! ” i cried indignantly . “ yes . i should fancy he had found her very useful , ” remarked poirot . “ so long as gossip busied itself in coupling their names together , any other vagaries of the doctor ’ s passed unobserved . ”
christie	styles	“ then you think he never really cared for her ? ” i asked eagerly—rather too eagerly , perhaps , under the circumstances . “ that , of course , i can not say , but—shall i tell you my own private opinion , hastings ? ”
christie	styles	“ yes. ” “ well , it is this : that mrs. cavendish does not care , and never has cared one little jot about dr. bauerstein ! ” “ do you really think so ? ” i could not disguise my pleasure .
christie	styles	“ i am quite sure of it . and i will tell you why. ” “ yes ? ” “ because she cares for someone else , _mon ami_. ” “ oh ! ” what did he mean ? in spite of myself , an agreeable warmth spread over me . i am not a vain man where women are concerned , but i remembered certain evidences , too lightly thought of at the time , perhaps , but which certainly seemed to indicate——
christie	styles	my pleasing thoughts were interrupted by the sudden entrance of miss howard . she glanced round hastily to make sure there was no one else in the room , and quickly produced an old sheet of brown paper . this she handed to poirot , murmuring as she did so the cryptic words :
christie	styles	“ on top of the wardrobe. ” then she hurriedly left the room . poirot unfolded the sheet of paper eagerly , and uttered an exclamation of satisfaction . he spread it out on the table .
christie	styles	“ come here , hastings . now tell me , what is that initial—j . or l. ? ” it was a medium sized sheet of paper , rather dusty , as though it had lain by for some time . but it was the label that was attracting poirot ’ s attention . at the top , it bore the printed stamp of messrs. parkson ’ s , the well-known theatrical costumiers , and it was addressed to “ — ( the debatable initial ) cavendish , esq. , styles court , styles st. mary , essex . ”
christie	styles	“ it might be t. , or it might be l. , ” i said , after studying the thing for a minute or two . “ it certainly isn ’ t a j. ” “ good , ” replied poirot , folding up the paper again . “ i , also , am of your way of thinking . it is an l. , depend upon it ! ”
christie	styles	“ where did it come from ? ” i asked curiously . “ is it important ? ” “ moderately so . it confirms a surmise of mine . having deduced its existence , i set miss howard to search for it , and , as you see , she has been successful . ”
christie	styles	“ what did she mean by ‘ on the top of the wardrobe ’ ? ” “ she meant , ” replied poirot promptly , “ that she found it on top of a wardrobe. ” “ a funny place for a piece of brown paper , ” i mused .
christie	styles	“ not at all . the top of a wardrobe is an excellent place for brown paper and cardboard boxes . i have kept them there myself . neatly arranged , there is nothing to offend the eye . ”
christie	styles	“ poirot , ” i asked earnestly , “ have you made up your mind about this crime ? ” “ yes—that is to say , i believe i know how it was committed. ” “ ah ! ” “ unfortunately , i have no proof beyond my surmise , unless—— ” with sudden energy , he caught me by the arm , and whirled me down the hall , calling out in french in his excitement : “ mademoiselle dorcas , mademoiselle dorcas , _un moment , s ’ il vous plaît ! _ ”
christie	styles	dorcas , quite flurried by the noise , came hurrying out of the pantry . “ my good dorcas , i have an idea—a little idea—if it should prove justified , what magnificent chance ! tell me , on monday , not tuesday , dorcas , but monday , the day before the tragedy , did anything go wrong with mrs. inglethorp ’ s bell ? ”
christie	styles	dorcas looked very surprised . “ yes , sir , now you mention it , it did ; though i don ’ t know how you came to hear of it . a mouse , or some such , must have nibbled the wire through . the man came and put it right on tuesday morning . ”
christie	styles	with a long drawn exclamation of ecstasy , poirot led the way back to the morning-room . “ see you , one should not ask for outside proof—no , reason should be enough . but the flesh is weak , it is consolation to find that one is on the right track . ah , my friend , i am like a giant refreshed . i run ! i leap ! ”
christie	styles	and , in very truth , run and leap he did , gambolling wildly down the stretch of lawn outside the long window . “ what is your remarkable little friend doing ? ” asked a voice behind me , and i turned to find mary cavendish at my elbow . she smiled , and so did i . “ what is it all about ? ”
christie	styles	“ really , i can ’ t tell you . he asked dorcas some question about a bell , and appeared so delighted with her answer that he is capering about as you see ! ” mary laughed .
christie	styles	“ how ridiculous ! he ’ s going out of the gate . isn ’ t he coming back to-day ? ” “ i don ’ t know . i ’ ve given up trying to guess what he ’ ll do next. ” “ is he quite mad , mr. hastings ? ”
christie	styles	“ i honestly don ’ t know . sometimes , i feel sure he is as mad as a hatter ; and then , just as he is at his maddest , i find there is method in his madness . ”
christie	styles	“ i see. ” in spite of her laugh , mary was looking thoughtful this morning . she seemed grave , almost sad . it occurred to me that it would be a good opportunity to tackle her on the subject of cynthia . i began rather tactfully , _i_ thought , but i had not gone far before she stopped me authoritatively .
christie	styles	“ you are an excellent advocate , i have no doubt , mr. hastings , but in this case your talents are quite thrown away . cynthia will run no risk of encountering any unkindness from me . ”
christie	styles	i began to stammer feebly that i hoped she hadn ’ t thought—— but again she stopped me , and her words were so unexpected that they quite drove cynthia , and her troubles , out of my mind .
christie	styles	“ mr . hastings , ” she said , “ do you think i and my husband are happy together ? ” i was considerably taken aback , and murmured something about it ’ s not being my business to think anything of the sort .
christie	styles	“ well , ” she said quietly , “ whether it is your business or not , i will tell you that we are _not_ happy. ” i said nothing , for i saw that she had not finished .
christie	styles	she began slowly , walking up and down the room , her head a little bent , and that slim , supple figure of hers swaying gently as she walked . she stopped suddenly , and looked up at me .
christie	styles	“ you don ’ t know anything about me , do you ? ” she asked . “ where i come from , who i was before i married john—anything , in fact ? well , i will tell you . i will make a father confessor of you . you are kind , i think—yes , i am sure you are kind . ”
christie	styles	somehow , i was not quite as elated as i might have been . i remembered that cynthia had begun her confidences in much the same way . besides , a father confessor should be elderly , it is not at all the role for a young man .
christie	styles	“ my father was english , ” said mrs. cavendish , “ but my mother was a russian. ” “ ah , ” i said , “ now i understand—— ” “ understand what ? ” “ a hint of something foreign—different—that there has always been about you . ”
christie	styles	“ my mother was very beautiful , i believe . i don ’ t know , because i never saw her . she died when i was quite a little child . i believe there was some tragedy connected with her death—she took an overdose of some sleeping draught by mistake . however that may be , my father was broken-hearted . shortly afterwards , he went into the consular service . everywhere he went , i went with him . when i was twenty-three , i had been nearly all over the world . it was a splendid life—i loved it . ”
christie	styles	there was a smile on her face , and her head was thrown back . she seemed living in the memory of those old glad days . “ then my father died . he left me very badly off . i had to go and live with some old aunts in yorkshire. ” she shuddered . “ you will understand me when i say that it was a deadly life for a girl brought up as i had been . the narrowness , the deadly monotony of it , almost drove me mad. ” she paused a minute , and added in a different tone : “ and then i met john cavendish . ”
christie	styles	“ yes ? ” “ you can imagine that , from my aunts ’ point of view , it was a very good match for me . but i can honestly say it was not this fact which weighed with me . no , he was simply a way of escape from the insufferable monotony of my life . ”
christie	styles	i said nothing , and after a moment , she went on : “ don ’ t misunderstand me . i was quite honest with him . i told him , what was true , that i liked him very much , that i hoped to come to like him more , but that i was not in any way what the world calls ‘ in love ’ with him . he declared that that satisfied him , and so—we were married . ”
christie	styles	she waited a long time , a little frown had gathered on her forehead . she seemed to be looking back earnestly into those past days . “ i think—i am sure—he cared for me at first . but i suppose we were not well matched . almost at once , we drifted apart . he—it is not a pleasing thing for my pride , but it is the truth—tired of me very soon. ” i must have made some murmur of dissent , for she went on quickly : “ oh , yes , he did ! not that it matters now—now that we ’ ve come to the parting of the ways . ”
christie	styles	“ what do you mean ? ” she answered quietly : “ i mean that i am not going to remain at styles. ” “ you and john are not going to live here ? ” “ john may live here , but i shall not . ”
christie	styles	“ you are going to leave him ? ” “ yes. ” “ but why ? ” she paused a long time , and said at last : “ perhaps—because i want to be—free ! ” and , as she spoke , i had a sudden vision of broad spaces , virgin tracts of forests , untrodden lands—and a realization of what freedom would mean to such a nature as mary cavendish . i seemed to see her for a moment as she was , a proud wild creature , as untamed by civilization as some shy bird of the hills . a little cry broke from her lips :
christie	styles	“ you don ’ t know , you don ’ t know , how this hateful place has been prison to me ! ” “ i understand , ” i said , “ but—but don ’ t do anything rash. ” “ oh , rash ! ” her voice mocked at my prudence .
christie	styles	then suddenly i said a thing i could have bitten out my tongue for : “ you know that dr. bauerstein has been arrested ? ” an instant coldness passed like a mask over her face , blotting out all expression .
christie	styles	“ john was so kind as to break that to me this morning. ” “ well , what do you think ? ” i asked feebly . “ of what ? ” “ of the arrest ? ” “ what should i think ? apparently he is a german spy ; so the gardener had told john . ”
christie	styles	her face and voice were absolutely cold and expressionless . did she care , or did she not ? she moved away a step or two , and fingered one of the flower vases .
christie	styles	“ these are quite dead . i must do them again . would you mind moving—thank you , mr. hastings. ” and she walked quietly past me out of the window , with a cool little nod of dismissal .
christie	styles	no , surely she could not care for bauerstein . no woman could act her part with that icy unconcern . poirot did not make his appearance the following morning , and there was no sign of the scotland yard men .
christie	styles	but , at lunch-time , there arrived a new piece of evidence—or rather lack of evidence . we had vainly tried to trace the fourth letter , which mrs. inglethorp had written on the evening preceding her death . our efforts having been in vain , we had abandoned the matter , hoping that it might turn up of itself one day . and this is just what did happen , in the shape of a communication , which arrived by the second post from a firm of french music publishers , acknowledging mrs. inglethorp ’ s cheque , and regretting they had been unable to trace a certain series of russian folksongs . so the last hope of solving the mystery , by means of mrs. inglethorp ’ s correspondence on the fatal evening , had to be abandoned .
christie	styles	just before tea , i strolled down to tell poirot of the new disappointment , but found , to my annoyance , that he was once more out . “ gone to london again ? ” “ oh , no , monsieur , he has but taken the train to tadminster . ‘ to see a young lady ’ s dispensary , ’ he said . ”
christie	styles	“ silly ass ! ” i ejaculated . “ i told him wednesday was the one day she wasn ’ t there ! well , tell him to look us up to-morrow morning , will you ? ” “ certainly , monsieur. ” but , on the following day , no sign of poirot . i was getting angry . he was really treating us in the most cavalier fashion .
christie	styles	after lunch , lawrence drew me aside , and asked if i was going down to see him . “ no , i don ’ t think i shall . he can come up here if he wants to see us . ”
christie	styles	“ oh ! ” lawrence looked indeterminate . something unusually nervous and excited in his manner roused my curiosity . “ what is it ? ” i asked . “ i could go if there ’ s anything special. ” “ it ’ s nothing much , but—well , if you are going , will you tell him—— ” he dropped his voice to a whisper— “ i think i ’ ve found the extra coffee-cup ! ”
christie	styles	i had almost forgotten that enigmatical message of poirot ’ s , but now my curiosity was aroused afresh . lawrence would say no more , so i decided that i would descend from my high horse , and once more seek out poirot at leastways cottage .
christie	styles	this time i was received with a smile . monsieur poirot was within . would i mount ? i mounted accordingly . poirot was sitting by the table , his head buried in his hands . he sprang up at my entrance .
christie	styles	“ what is it ? ” i asked solicitously . “ you are not ill , i trust ? ” “ no , no , not ill . but i decide an affair of great moment. ” “ whether to catch the criminal or not ? ” i asked facetiously .
christie	styles	but , to my great surprise , poirot nodded gravely . “ ‘ to speak or not to speak , ’ as your so great shakespeare says , ‘ that is the question. ’ ” i did not trouble to correct the quotation .
christie	styles	“ you are not serious , poirot ? ” “ i am of the most serious . for the most serious of all things hangs in the balance. ” “ and that is ? ” “ a woman ’ s happiness , _mon ami_ , ” he said gravely .
christie	styles	i did not quite know what to say . “ the moment has come , ” said poirot thoughtfully , “ and i do not know what to do . for , see you , it is a big stake for which i play . no one but i , hercule poirot , would attempt it ! ” and he tapped himself proudly on the breast .
christie	styles	after pausing a few minutes respectfully , so as not to spoil his effect , i gave him lawrence ’ s message . “ aha ! ” he cried . “ so he has found the extra coffee-cup . that is good . he has more intelligence than would appear , this long-faced monsieur lawrence of yours ! ”
christie	styles	i did not myself think very highly of lawrence ’ s intelligence ; but i forebore to contradict poirot , and gently took him to task for forgetting my instructions as to which were cynthia ’ s days off .
christie	styles	“ it is true . i have the head of a sieve . however , the other young lady was most kind . she was sorry for my disappointment , and showed me everything in the kindest way . ”
christie	styles	“ oh , well , that ’ s all right , then , and you must go to tea with cynthia another day. ” i told him about the letter . “ i am sorry for that , ” he said . “ i always had hopes of that letter . but no , it was not to be . this affair must all be unravelled from within. ” he tapped his forehead . “ these little grey cells . it is ‘ up to them ’ —as you say over here. ” then , suddenly , he asked : “ are you a judge of finger-marks , my friend ? ”
christie	styles	“ no , ” i said , rather surprised , “ i know that there are no two finger-marks alike , but that ’ s as far as my science goes. ” “ exactly. ” he unlocked a little drawer , and took out some photographs which he laid on the table .
christie	styles	“ i have numbered them , 1 , 2 , 3 . will you describe them to me ? ” i studied the proofs attentively . “ all greatly magnified , i see . no . 1 , i should say , are a man ’ s finger-prints ; thumb and first finger . no . 2 are a lady ’ s ; they are much smaller , and quite different in every way . no . 3 ” —i paused for some time— “ there seem to be a lot of confused finger-marks , but here , very distinctly , are no . 1 ’ s . ”
christie	styles	“ overlapping the others ? ” “ yes. ” “ you recognize them beyond fail ? ” “ oh , yes ; they are identical. ” poirot nodded , and gently taking the photographs from me locked them up again . “ i suppose , ” i said , “ that as usual , you are not going to explain ? ”
christie	styles	“ on the contrary . no . 1 were the finger-prints of monsieur lawrence . no . 2 were those of mademoiselle cynthia . they are not important . i merely obtained them for comparison . no . 3 is a little more complicated . ”
christie	styles	“ yes ? ” “ it is , as you see , highly magnified . you may have noticed a sort of blur extending all across the picture . i will not describe to you the special apparatus , dusting powder , etc. , which i used . it is a well-known process to the police , and by means of it you can obtain a photograph of the finger-prints of any object in a very short space of time . well , my friend , you have seen the finger-marks—it remains to tell you the particular object on which they had been left . ”
christie	styles	“ go on—i am really excited. ” “ _eh bien ! _ photo no . 3 represents the highly magnified surface of a tiny bottle in the top poison cupboard of the dispensary in the red cross hospital at tadminster—which sounds like the house that jack built ! ”
christie	styles	“ good heavens ! ” i exclaimed . “ but what were lawrence cavendish ’ s finger-marks doing on it ? he never went near the poison cupboard the day we were there ! ” “ oh , yes , he did ! ” “ impossible ! we were all together the whole time . ”
christie	styles	poirot shook his head . “ no , my friend , there was a moment when you were not all together . there was a moment when you could not have been all together , or it would not have been necessary to call to monsieur lawrence to come and join you on the balcony . ”
christie	styles	“ i ’ d forgotten that , ” i admitted . “ but it was only for a moment. ” “ long enough. ” “ long enough for what ? ” poirot ’ s smile became rather enigmatical . “ long enough for a gentleman who had once studied medicine to gratify a very natural interest and curiosity . ”
christie	styles	our eyes met . poirot ’ s were pleasantly vague . he got up and hummed a little tune . i watched him suspiciously . “ poirot , ” i said , “ what was in this particular little bottle ? ” poirot looked out of the window .
christie	styles	“ hydro-chloride of strychnine , ” he said , over his shoulder , continuing to hum . “ good heavens ! ” i said it quite quietly . i was not surprised . i had expected that answer . “ they use the pure hydro-chloride of strychnine very little—only occasionally for pills . it is the official solution , liq . strychnine hydro-clor . that is used in most medicines . that is why the finger-marks have remained undisturbed since then . ”
christie	styles	“ how did you manage to take this photograph ? ” “ i dropped my hat from the balcony , ” explained poirot simply . “ visitors were not permitted below at that hour , so , in spite of my many apologies , mademoiselle cynthia ’ s colleague had to go down and fetch it for me . ”
christie	styles	“ then you knew what you were going to find ? ” “ no , not at all . i merely realized that it was possible , from your story , for monsieur lawrence to go to the poison cupboard . the possibility had to be confirmed , or eliminated . ”
christie	styles	“ poirot , ” i said , “ your gaiety does not deceive me . this is a very important discovery. ” “ i do not know , ” said poirot . “ but one thing does strike me . no doubt it has struck you too . ”
christie	styles	“ what is that ? ” “ why , that there is altogether too much strychnine about this case . this is the third time we run up against it . there was strychnine in mrs. inglethorp ’ s tonic . there is the strychnine sold across the counter at styles st. mary by mace . now we have more strychnine , handled by one of the household . it is confusing ; and , as you know , i do not like confusion . ”
christie	styles	before i could reply , one of the other belgians opened the door and stuck his head in . “ there is a lady below , asking for mr hastings. ” “ a lady ? ” i jumped up . poirot followed me down the narrow stairs . mary cavendish was standing in the doorway .
christie	styles	“ i have been visiting an old woman in the village , ” she explained , “ and as lawrence told me you were with monsieur poirot i thought i would call for you. ” “ alas , madame , ” said poirot , “ i thought you had come to honour me with a visit ! ”
christie	styles	“ i will some day , if you ask me , ” she promised him , smiling . “ that is well . if you should need a father confessor , madame ” —she started ever so slightly— “ remember , papa poirot is always at your service . ”
christie	styles	she stared at him for a few minutes , as though seeking to read some deeper meaning into his words . then she turned abruptly away . “ come , will you not walk back with us too , monsieur poirot ? ”
christie	styles	“ enchanted , madame. ” all the way to styles , mary talked fast and feverishly . it struck me that in some way she was nervous of poirot ’ s eyes . the weather had broken , and the sharp wind was almost autumnal in its shrewishness . mary shivered a little , and buttoned her black sports coat closer . the wind through the trees made a mournful noise , like some great giant sighing .
christie	styles	we walked up to the great door of styles , and at once the knowledge came to us that something was wrong . dorcas came running out to meet us . she was crying and wringing her hands . i was aware of other servants huddled together in the background , all eyes and ears .
christie	styles	“ oh , m ’ am ! oh , m ’ am ! i don ’ t know how to tell you—— ” “ what is it , dorcas ? ” i asked impatiently . “ tell us at once. ” “ it ’ s those wicked detectives . they ’ ve arrested him—they ’ ve arrested mr. cavendish ! ”
christie	styles	“ arrested lawrence ? ” i gasped . i saw a strange look come into dorcas ’ s eyes . “ no , sir . not mr. lawrence—mr . john. ” behind me , with a wild cry , mary cavendish fell heavily against me , and as i turned to catch her i met the quiet triumph in poirot ’ s eyes .
christie	styles	chapter xi . the case for the prosecution the trial of john cavendish for the murder of his stepmother took place two months later . of the intervening weeks i will say little , but my admiration and sympathy went out unfeignedly to mary cavendish . she ranged herself passionately on her husband ’ s side , scorning the mere idea of his guilt , and fought for him tooth and nail .
christie	styles	i expressed my admiration to poirot , and he nodded thoughtfully . “ yes , she is of those women who show at their best in adversity . it brings out all that is sweetest and truest in them . her pride and her jealousy have—— ”
christie	styles	“ jealousy ? ” i queried . “ yes . have you not realized that she is an unusually jealous woman ? as i was saying , her pride and jealousy have been laid aside . she thinks of nothing but her husband , and the terrible fate that is hanging over him . ”
christie	styles	he spoke very feelingly , and i looked at him earnestly , remembering that last afternoon , when he had been deliberating whether or not to speak . with his tenderness for “ a woman ’ s happiness , ” i felt glad that the decision had been taken out of his hands .
christie	styles	“ even now , ” i said , “ i can hardly believe it . you see , up to the very last minute , i thought it was lawrence ! ” poirot grinned . “ i know you did. ” “ but john ! my old friend john ! ”
christie	styles	“ every murderer is probably somebody ’ s old friend , ” observed poirot philosophically . “ you can not mix up sentiment and reason. ” “ i must say i think you might have given me a hint. ” “ perhaps , _mon ami_ , i did not do so , just because he _was_ your old friend . ”
christie	styles	i was rather disconcerted by this , remembering how i had busily passed on to john what i believed to be poirot ’ s views concerning bauerstein . he , by the way , had been acquitted of the charge brought against him . nevertheless , although he had been too clever for them this time , and the charge of espionage could not be brought home to him , his wings were pretty well clipped for the future .
christie	styles	i asked poirot whether he thought john would be condemned . to my intense surprise , he replied that , on the contrary , he was extremely likely to be acquitted . “ but , poirot—— ” i protested .
christie	styles	“ oh , my friend , have i not said to you all along that i have no proofs . it is one thing to know that a man is guilty , it is quite another matter to prove him so . and , in this case , there is terribly little evidence . that is the whole trouble . i , hercule poirot , know , but i lack the last link in my chain . and unless i can find that missing link—— ” he shook his head gravely .
christie	styles	“ when did you first suspect john cavendish ? ” i asked , after a minute or two . “ did you not suspect him at all ? ” “ no , indeed. ” “ not after that fragment of conversation you overheard between mrs. cavendish and her mother-in-law , and her subsequent lack of frankness at the inquest ? ”
christie	styles	“ no. ” “ did you not put two and two together , and reflect that if it was not alfred inglethorp who was quarrelling with his wife—and you remember , he strenuously denied it at the inquest—it must be either lawrence or john . now , if it was lawrence , mary cavendish ’ s conduct was just as inexplicable . but if , on the other hand , it was john , the whole thing was explained quite naturally . ”
christie	styles	“ so , ” i cried , a light breaking in upon me , “ it was john who quarrelled with his mother that afternoon ? ” “ exactly. ” “ and you have known this all along ? ” “ certainly . mrs. cavendish ’ s behaviour could only be explained that way . ”
christie	styles	“ and yet you say he may be acquitted ? ” poirot shrugged his shoulders . “ certainly i do . at the police court proceedings , we shall hear the case for the prosecution , but in all probability his solicitors will advise him to reserve his defence . that will be sprung upon us at the trial . and—ah , by the way , i have a word of caution to give you , my friend . i must not appear in the case . ”
christie	styles	“ what ? ” “ no . officially , i have nothing to do with it . until i have found that last link in my chain , i must remain behind the scenes . mrs. cavendish must think i am working for her husband , not against him . ”
christie	styles	“ i say , that ’ s playing it a bit low down , ” i protested . “ not at all . we have to deal with a most clever and unscrupulous man , and we must use any means in our power—otherwise he will slip through our fingers . that is why i have been careful to remain in the background . all the discoveries have been made by japp , and japp will take all the credit . if i am called upon to give evidence at all ” —he smiled broadly— “ it will probably be as a witness for the defence . ”
christie	styles	i could hardly believe my ears . “ it is quite _en règle_ , ” continued poirot . “ strangely enough , i can give evidence that will demolish one contention of the prosecution. ” “ which one ? ” “ the one that relates to the destruction of the will . john cavendish did not destroy that will . ”
christie	styles	poirot was a true prophet . i will not go into the details of the police court proceedings , as it involves many tiresome repetitions . i will merely state baldly that john cavendish reserved his defence , and was duly committed for trial .
christie	styles	september found us all in london . mary took a house in kensington , poirot being included in the family party . i myself had been given a job at the war office , so was able to see them continually .
christie	styles	as the weeks went by , the state of poirot ’ s nerves grew worse and worse . that “ last link ” he talked about was still lacking . privately , i hoped it might remain so , for what happiness could there be for mary , if john were not acquitted ?
christie	styles	on september 15th john cavendish appeared in the dock at the old bailey , charged with “ the wilful murder of emily agnes inglethorp , ” and pleaded “ not guilty. ” sir ernest heavywether , the famous k.c. , had been engaged to defend him .
christie	styles	mr. philips , k.c. , opened the case for the crown . the murder , he said , was a most premeditated and cold-blooded one . it was neither more nor less than the deliberate poisoning of a fond and trusting woman by the stepson to whom she had been more than a mother . ever since his boyhood , she had supported him . he and his wife had lived at styles court in every luxury , surrounded by her care and attention . she had been their kind and generous benefactress .
christie	styles	he proposed to call witnesses to show how the prisoner , a profligate and spendthrift , had been at the end of his financial tether , and had also been carrying on an intrigue with a certain mrs. raikes , a neighbouring farmer ’ s wife . this having come to his stepmother ’ s ears , she taxed him with it on the afternoon before her death , and a quarrel ensued , part of which was overheard . on the previous day , the prisoner had purchased strychnine at the village chemist ’ s shop , wearing a disguise by means of which he hoped to throw the onus of the crime upon another man—to wit , mrs. inglethorp ’ s husband , of whom he had been bitterly jealous . luckily for mr. inglethorp , he had been able to produce an unimpeachable alibi .
christie	styles	on the afternoon of july 17th , continued counsel , immediately after the quarrel with her son , mrs. inglethorp made a new will . this will was found destroyed in the grate of her bedroom the following morning , but evidence had come to light which showed that it had been drawn up in favour of her husband . deceased had already made a will in his favour before her marriage , but—and mr. philips wagged an expressive forefinger—the prisoner was not aware of that . what had induced the deceased to make a fresh will , with the old one still extant , he could not say . she was an old lady , and might possibly have forgotten the former one ; or—this seemed to him more likely—she may have had an idea that it was revoked by her marriage , as there had been some conversation on the subject . ladies were not always very well versed in legal knowledge . she had , about a year before , executed a will in favour of the prisoner . he would call evidence to show that it was the prisoner who ultimately handed his stepmother her coffee on the fatal night . later in the evening , he had sought admission to her room , on which occasion , no doubt , he found an opportunity of destroying the will which , as far as he knew , would render the one in his favour valid .
christie	styles	the prisoner had been arrested in consequence of the discovery , in his room , by detective inspector japp—a most brilliant officer—of the identical phial of strychnine which had been sold at the village chemist ’ s to the supposed mr. inglethorp on the day before the murder . it would be for the jury to decide whether or not these damning facts constituted an overwhelming proof of the prisoner ’ s guilt .
christie	styles	and , subtly implying that a jury which did not so decide , was quite unthinkable , mr. philips sat down and wiped his forehead . the first witnesses for the prosecution were mostly those who had been called at the inquest , the medical evidence being again taken first .
christie	styles	sir ernest heavywether , who was famous all over england for the unscrupulous manner in which he bullied witnesses , only asked two questions . “ i take it , dr. bauerstein , that strychnine , as a drug , acts quickly ? ”
christie	styles	“ yes. ” “ and that you are unable to account for the delay in this case ? ” “ yes. ” “ thank you. ” mr. mace identified the phial handed him by counsel as that sold by him to “ mr . inglethorp. ” pressed , he admitted that he only knew mr. inglethorp by sight . he had never spoken to him . the witness was not cross-examined .
christie	styles	alfred inglethorp was called , and denied having purchased the poison . he also denied having quarrelled with his wife . various witnesses testified to the accuracy of these statements . the gardeners ’ evidence , as to the witnessing of the will was taken , and then dorcas was called .
christie	styles	dorcas , faithful to her “ young gentlemen , ” denied strenuously that it could have been john ’ s voice she heard , and resolutely declared , in the teeth of everything , that it was mr. inglethorp who had been in the boudoir with her mistress . a rather wistful smile passed across the face of the prisoner in the dock . he knew only too well how useless her gallant defiance was , since it was not the object of the defence to deny this point . mrs. cavendish , of course , could not be called upon to give evidence against her husband .
christie	styles	after various questions on other matters , mr. philips asked : “ in the month of june last , do you remember a parcel arriving for mr. lawrence cavendish from parkson ’ s ? ” dorcas shook her head .
christie	styles	“ i don ’ t remember , sir . it may have done , but mr. lawrence was away from home part of june. ” “ in the event of a parcel arriving for him whilst he was away , what would be done with it ? ”
christie	styles	“ it would either be put in his room or sent on after him. ” “ by you ? ” “ no , sir , i should leave it on the hall table . it would be miss howard who would attend to anything like that . ”
christie	styles	evelyn howard was called and , after being examined on other points , was questioned as to the parcel . “ don ’ t remember . lots of parcels come . can ’ t remember one special one. ” “ you do not know if it was sent after mr. lawrence cavendish to wales , or whether it was put in his room ? ”
christie	styles	“ don ’ t think it was sent after him . should have remembered it if it was. ” “ supposing a parcel arrived addressed to mr. lawrence cavendish , and afterwards it disappeared , should you remark its absence ? ”
christie	styles	“ no , don ’ t think so . i should think someone had taken charge of it. ” “ i believe , miss howard , that it was you who found this sheet of brown paper ? ” he held up the same dusty piece which poirot and i had examined in the morning-room at styles .
christie	styles	“ yes , i did. ” “ how did you come to look for it ? ” “ the belgian detective who was employed on the case asked me to search for it. ” “ where did you eventually discover it ? ”
christie	styles	“ on the top of—of—a wardrobe. ” “ on top of the prisoner ’ s wardrobe ? ” “ i—i believe so. ” “ did you not find it yourself ? ” “ yes. ” “ then you must know where you found it ? ” “ yes , it was on the prisoner ’ s wardrobe . ”
christie	styles	“ that is better. ” an assistant from parkson ’ s , theatrical costumiers , testified that on june 29th , they had supplied a black beard to mr. l. cavendish , as requested . it was ordered by letter , and a postal order was enclosed . no , they had not kept the letter . all transactions were entered in their books . they had sent the beard , as directed , to “ l . cavendish , esq. , styles court . ”
christie	styles	sir ernest heavywether rose ponderously . “ where was the letter written from ? ” “ from styles court. ” “ the same address to which you sent the parcel ? ” “ yes. ” “ and the letter came from there ? ”
christie	styles	“ yes. ” like a beast of prey , heavywether fell upon him : “ how do you know ? ” “ i—i don ’ t understand. ” “ how do you know that letter came from styles ? did you notice the postmark ? ”
christie	styles	“ no—but—— ” “ ah , you did _not_ notice the postmark ! and yet you affirm so confidently that it came from styles . it might , in fact , have been any postmark ? ” “ y—es. ” “ in fact , the letter , though written on stamped notepaper , might have been posted from anywhere ? from wales , for instance ? ”
christie	styles	the witness admitted that such might be the case , and sir ernest signified that he was satisfied . elizabeth wells , second housemaid at styles , stated that after she had gone to bed she remembered that she had bolted the front door , instead of leaving it on the latch as mr. inglethorp had requested . she had accordingly gone downstairs again to rectify her error . hearing a slight noise in the west wing , she had peeped along the passage , and had seen mr. john cavendish knocking at mrs. inglethorp ’ s door .
christie	styles	sir ernest heavywether made short work of her , and under his unmerciful bullying she contradicted herself hopelessly , and sir ernest sat down again with a satisfied smile on his face .
christie	styles	with the evidence of annie , as to the candle grease on the floor , and as to seeing the prisoner take the coffee into the boudoir , the proceedings were adjourned until the following day .
christie	styles	as we went home , mary cavendish spoke bitterly against the prosecuting counsel . “ that hateful man ! what a net he has drawn around my poor john ! how he twisted every little fact until he made it seem what it wasn ’ t ! ”
christie	styles	“ well , ” i said consolingly , “ it will be the other way about to-morrow. ” “ yes , ” she said meditatively ; then suddenly dropped her voice . “ mr . hastings , you do not think—surely it could not have been lawrence—oh , no , that could not be ! ”
christie	styles	but i myself was puzzled , and as soon as i was alone with poirot i asked him what he thought sir ernest was driving at . “ ah ! ” said poirot appreciatively . “ he is a clever man , that sir ernest . ”
christie	styles	“ do you think he believes lawrence guilty ? ” “ i do not think he believes or cares anything ! no , what he is trying for is to create such confusion in the minds of the jury that they are divided in their opinion as to which brother did it . he is endeavouring to make out that there is quite as much evidence against lawrence as against john—and i am not at all sure that he will not succeed . ”
christie	styles	detective-inspector japp was the first witness called when the trial was reopened , and gave his evidence succinctly and briefly . after relating the earlier events , he proceeded : “ acting on information received , superintendent summerhaye and myself searched the prisoner ’ s room , during his temporary absence from the house . in his chest of drawers , hidden beneath some underclothing , we found : first , a pair of gold-rimmed pince-nez similar to those worn by mr. inglethorp ” —these were exhibited— “ secondly , this phial . ”
christie	styles	the phial was that already recognized by the chemist ’ s assistant , a tiny bottle of blue glass , containing a few grains of a white crystalline powder , and labelled : “ strychnine hydro-chloride . poison . ”
christie	styles	a fresh piece of evidence discovered by the detectives since the police court proceedings was a long , almost new piece of blotting-paper . it had been found in mrs. inglethorp ’ s cheque book , and on being reversed at a mirror , showed clearly the words : “ . . . erything of which i die possessed i leave to my beloved husband alfred ing ... ” this placed beyond question the fact that the destroyed will had been in favour of the deceased lady ’ s husband . japp then produced the charred fragment of paper recovered from the grate , and this , with the discovery of the beard in the attic , completed his evidence .
christie	styles	but sir ernest ’ s cross-examination was yet to come . “ what day was it when you searched the prisoner ’ s room ? ” “ tuesday , the 24th of july. ” “ exactly a week after the tragedy ? ” “ yes . ”
christie	styles	“ you found these two objects , you say , in the chest of drawers . was the drawer unlocked ? ” “ yes. ” “ does it not strike you as unlikely that a man who had committed a crime should keep the evidence of it in an unlocked drawer for anyone to find ? ”
christie	styles	“ he might have stowed them there in a hurry. ” “ but you have just said it was a whole week since the crime . he would have had ample time to remove them and destroy them . ”
christie	styles	“ perhaps. ” “ there is no perhaps about it . would he , or would he not have had plenty of time to remove and destroy them ? ” “ yes. ” “ was the pile of underclothes under which the things were hidden heavy or light ? ”
christie	styles	“ heavyish. ” “ in other words , it was winter underclothing . obviously , the prisoner would not be likely to go to that drawer ? ” “ perhaps not. ” “ kindly answer my question . would the prisoner , in the hottest week of a hot summer , be likely to go to a drawer containing winter underclothing . yes , or no ? ”
christie	styles	“ no. ” “ in that case , is it not possible that the articles in question might have been put there by a third person , and that the prisoner was quite unaware of their presence ? ”
christie	styles	“ i should not think it likely. ” “ but it is possible ? ” “ yes. ” “ that is all. ” more evidence followed . evidence as to the financial difficulties in which the prisoner had found himself at the end of july . evidence as to his intrigue with mrs. raikes—poor mary , that must have been bitter hearing for a woman of her pride . evelyn howard had been right in her facts , though her animosity against alfred inglethorp had caused her to jump to the conclusion that he was the person concerned .
christie	styles	lawrence cavendish was then put into the box . in a low voice , in answer to mr. philips ’ questions , he denied having ordered anything from parkson ’ s in june . in fact , on june 29th , he had been staying away , in wales .
christie	styles	instantly , sir ernest ’ s chin was shooting pugnaciously forward . “ you deny having ordered a black beard from parkson ’ s on june 29th ? ” “ i do. ” “ ah ! in the event of anything happening to your brother , who will inherit styles court ? ”
christie	styles	the brutality of the question called a flush to lawrence ’ s pale face . the judge gave vent to a faint murmur of disapprobation , and the prisoner in the dock leant forward angrily .
christie	styles	heavywether cared nothing for his client ’ s anger . “ answer my question , if you please. ” “ i suppose , ” said lawrence quietly , “ that i should. ” “ what do you mean by you ‘ suppose ’ ? your brother has no children . you _would_ inherit it , wouldn ’ t you ? ”
christie	styles	“ yes. ” “ ah , that ’ s better , ” said heavywether , with ferocious geniality . “ and you ’ d inherit a good slice of money too , wouldn ’ t you ? ” “ really , sir ernest , ” protested the judge , “ these questions are not relevant . ”
christie	styles	sir ernest bowed , and having shot his arrow proceeded . “ on tuesday , the 17th july , you went , i believe , with another guest , to visit the dispensary at the red cross hospital in tadminster ? ”
christie	styles	“ yes. ” “ did you—while you happened to be alone for a few seconds—unlock the poison cupboard , and examine some of the bottles ? ” “ i—i—may have done so. ” “ i put it to you that you did do so ? ”
christie	styles	“ yes. ” sir ernest fairly shot the next question at him . “ did you examine one bottle in particular ? ” “ no , i do not think so. ” “ be careful , mr. cavendish . i am referring to a little bottle of hydro-chloride of strychnine . ”
christie	styles	lawrence was turning a sickly greenish colour . “ n—o—i am sure i didn ’ t. ” “ then how do you account for the fact that you left the unmistakable impress of your finger-prints on it ? ”
christie	styles	the bullying manner was highly efficacious with a nervous disposition . “ i—i suppose i must have taken up the bottle. ” “ i suppose so too ! did you abstract any of the contents of the bottle ? ”
christie	styles	“ certainly not. ” “ then why did you take it up ? ” “ i once studied to be a doctor . such things naturally interest me. ” “ ah ! so poisons ‘ naturally interest ’ you , do they ? still , you waited to be alone before gratifying that ‘ interest ’ of yours ? ”
christie	styles	“ that was pure chance . if the others had been there , i should have done just the same. ” “ still , as it happens , the others were not there ? ” “ no , but—— ” “ in fact , during the whole afternoon , you were only alone for a couple of minutes , and it happened—i say , it happened—to be during those two minutes that you displayed your ‘ natural interest ’ in hydro-chloride of strychnine ? ”
christie	styles	lawrence stammered pitiably . “ i—i—— ” with a satisfied and expressive countenance , sir ernest observed : “ i have nothing more to ask you , mr. cavendish. ” this bit of cross-examination had caused great excitement in court . the heads of the many fashionably attired women present were busily laid together , and their whispers became so loud that the judge angrily threatened to have the court cleared if there was not immediate silence .
christie	styles	there was little more evidence . the hand-writing experts were called upon for their opinion of the signature of “ alfred inglethorp ” in the chemist ’ s poison register . they all declared unanimously that it was certainly not his hand-writing , and gave it as their view that it might be that of the prisoner disguised . cross-examined , they admitted that it might be the prisoner ’ s hand-writing cleverly counterfeited .
christie	styles	sir ernest heavywether ’ s speech in opening the case for the defence was not a long one , but it was backed by the full force of his emphatic manner . never , he said , in the course of his long experience , had he known a charge of murder rest on slighter evidence . not only was it entirely circumstantial , but the greater part of it was practically unproved . let them take the testimony they had heard and sift it impartially . the strychnine had been found in a drawer in the prisoner ’ s room . that drawer was an unlocked one , as he had pointed out , and he submitted that there was no evidence to prove that it was the prisoner who had concealed the poison there . it was , in fact , a wicked and malicious attempt on the part of some third person to fix the crime on the prisoner . the prosecution had been unable to produce a shred of evidence in support of their contention that it was the prisoner who ordered the black beard from parkson ’ s . the quarrel which had taken place between prisoner and his stepmother was freely admitted , but both it and his financial embarrassments had been grossly exaggerated .
christie	styles	his learned friend—sir ernest nodded carelessly at mr. philips—had stated that if the prisoner were an innocent man , he would have come forward at the inquest to explain that it was he , and not mr. inglethorp , who had been the participator in the quarrel . he thought the facts had been misrepresented . what had actually occurred was this . the prisoner , returning to the house on tuesday evening , had been authoritatively told that there had been a violent quarrel between mr. and mrs. inglethorp . no suspicion had entered the prisoner ’ s head that anyone could possibly have mistaken his voice for that of mr. inglethorp . he naturally concluded that his stepmother had had two quarrels .
christie	styles	the prosecution averred that on monday , july 16th , the prisoner had entered the chemist ’ s shop in the village , disguised as mr. inglethorp . the prisoner , on the contrary , was at that time at a lonely spot called marston ’ s spinney , where he had been summoned by an anonymous note , couched in blackmailing terms , and threatening to reveal certain matters to his wife unless he complied with its demands . the prisoner had , accordingly , gone to the appointed spot , and after waiting there vainly for half an hour had returned home . unfortunately , he had met with no one on the way there or back who could vouch for the truth of his story , but luckily he had kept the note , and it would be produced as evidence .
christie	styles	as for the statement relating to the destruction of the will , the prisoner had formerly practised at the bar , and was perfectly well aware that the will made in his favour a year before was automatically revoked by his stepmother ’ s remarriage . he would call evidence to show who did destroy the will , and it was possible that that might open up quite a new view of the case .
christie	styles	finally , he would point out to the jury that there was evidence against other people besides john cavendish . he would direct their attention to the fact that the evidence against mr. lawrence cavendish was quite as strong , if not stronger than that against his brother .
christie	styles	he would now call the prisoner . john acquitted himself well in the witness-box . under sir ernest ’ s skilful handling , he told his tale credibly and well . the anonymous note received by him was produced , and handed to the jury to examine . the readiness with which he admitted his financial difficulties , and the disagreement with his stepmother , lent value to his denials .
christie	styles	at the close of his examination , he paused , and said : “ i should like to make one thing clear . i utterly reject and disapprove of sir ernest heavywether ’ s insinuations against my brother . my brother , i am convinced , had no more to do with the crime than i have . ”
christie	styles	sir ernest merely smiled , and noted with a sharp eye that john ’ s protest had produced a very favourable impression on the jury . then the cross-examination began . “ i understand you to say that it never entered your head that the witnesses at the inquest could possibly have mistaken your voice for that of mr. inglethorp . is not that very surprising ? ”
christie	styles	“ no , i don ’ t think so . i was told there had been a quarrel between my mother and mr. inglethorp , and it never occurred to me that such was not really the case . ”
christie	styles	“ not when the servant dorcas repeated certain fragments of the conversation—fragments which you must have recognized ? ” “ i did not recognize them. ” “ your memory must be unusually short ! ” “ no , but we were both angry , and , i think , said more than we meant . i paid very little attention to my mother ’ s actual words . ”
christie	styles	mr. philips ’ incredulous sniff was a triumph of forensic skill . he passed on to the subject of the note . “ you have produced this note very opportunely . tell me , is there nothing familiar about the hand-writing of it ? ”
christie	styles	“ not that i know of. ” “ do you not think that it bears a marked resemblance to your own hand-writing—carelessly disguised ? ” “ no , i do not think so. ” “ i put it to you that it is your own hand-writing ! ”
christie	styles	“ no. ” “ i put it to you that , anxious to prove an alibi , you conceived the idea of a fictitious and rather incredible appointment , and wrote this note yourself in order to bear out your statement ! ”
christie	styles	“ no. ” “ is it not a fact that , at the time you claim to have been waiting about at a solitary and unfrequented spot , you were really in the chemist ’ s shop in styles st. mary , where you purchased strychnine in the name of alfred inglethorp ? ”
christie	styles	“ no , that is a lie. ” “ i put it to you that , wearing a suit of mr. inglethorp ’ s clothes , with a black beard trimmed to resemble his , you were there—and signed the register in his name ! ”
christie	styles	“ that is absolutely untrue. ” “ then i will leave the remarkable similarity of hand-writing between the note , the register , and your own , to the consideration of the jury , ” said mr. philips , and sat down with the air of a man who has done his duty , but who was nevertheless horrified by such deliberate perjury .
christie	styles	after this , as it was growing late , the case was adjourned till monday . poirot , i noticed , was looking profoundly discouraged . he had that little frown between the eyes that i knew so well .
christie	styles	“ what is it , poirot ? ” i inquired . “ ah , _mon ami_ , things are going badly , badly. ” in spite of myself , my heart gave a leap of relief . evidently there was a likelihood of john cavendish being acquitted .
christie	styles	when we reached the house , my little friend waved aside mary ’ s offer of tea . “ no , i thank you , madame . i will mount to my room. ” i followed him . still frowning , he went across to the desk and took out a small pack of patience cards . then he drew up a chair to the table , and , to my utter amazement , began solemnly to build card houses !
christie	styles	my jaw dropped involuntarily , and he said at once : “ no , _mon ami_ , i am not in my second childhood ! i steady my nerves , that is all . this employment requires precision of the fingers . with precision of the fingers goes precision of the brain . and never have i needed that more than now ! ”
christie	styles	“ what is the trouble ? ” i asked . with a great thump on the table , poirot demolished his carefully built up edifice . “ it is this , _mon ami ! _ that i can build card houses seven stories high , but i can not ” —thump— “ find ” —thump— “ that last link of which i spoke to you . ”
christie	styles	i could not quite tell what to say , so i held my peace , and he began slowly building up the cards again , speaking in jerks as he did so . “ it is done—so ! by placing—one card—on another—with mathematical—precision ! ”
christie	styles	i watched the card house rising under his hands , story by story . he never hesitated or faltered . it was really almost like a conjuring trick . “ what a steady hand you ’ ve got , ” i remarked . “ i believe i ’ ve only seen your hand shake once . ”
christie	styles	“ on an occasion when i was enraged , without doubt , ” observed poirot , with great placidity . “ yes indeed ! you were in a towering rage . do you remember ? it was when you discovered that the lock of the despatch-case in mrs. inglethorp ’ s bedroom had been forced . you stood by the mantelpiece , twiddling the things on it in your usual fashion , and your hand shook like a leaf ! i must say—— ”
christie	styles	but i stopped suddenly . for poirot , uttering a hoarse and inarticulate cry , again annihilated his masterpiece of cards , and putting his hands over his eyes swayed backwards and forwards , apparently suffering the keenest agony .
christie	styles	“ good heavens , poirot ! ” i cried . “ what is the matter ? are you taken ill ? ” “ no , no , ” he gasped . “ it is—it is—that i have an idea ! ” “ oh ! ” i exclaimed , much relieved . “ one of your ‘ little ideas ’ ? ”
christie	styles	“ ah , _ma foi_ , no ! ” replied poirot frankly . “ this time it is an idea gigantic ! stupendous ! and you—_you_ , my friend , have given it to me ! ” suddenly clasping me in his arms , he kissed me warmly on both cheeks , and before i had recovered from my surprise ran headlong from the room .
christie	styles	mary cavendish entered at that moment . “ what _is_ the matter with monsieur poirot ? he rushed past me crying out : ‘ a garage ! for the love of heaven , direct me to a garage , madame ! ’ and , before i could answer , he had dashed out into the street . ”
christie	styles	i hurried to the window . true enough , there he was , tearing down the street , hatless , and gesticulating as he went . i turned to mary with a gesture of despair . “ he ’ ll be stopped by a policeman in another minute . there he goes , round the corner ! ”
christie	styles	our eyes met , and we stared helplessly at one another . “ what can be the matter ? ” i shook my head . “ i don ’ t know . he was building card houses , when suddenly he said he had an idea , and rushed off as you saw . ”
christie	styles	“ well , ” said mary , “ i expect he will be back before dinner. ” but night fell , and poirot had not returned . chapter xii . the last link poirot ’ s abrupt departure had intrigued us all greatly . sunday morning wore away , and still he did not reappear . but about three o ’ clock a ferocious and prolonged hooting outside drove us to the window , to see poirot alighting from a car , accompanied by japp and summerhaye . the little man was transformed . he radiated an absurd complacency . he bowed with exaggerated respect to mary cavendish .
christie	styles	“ madame , i have your permission to hold a little _réunion_ in the _salon_ ? it is necessary for everyone to attend. ” mary smiled sadly . “ you know , monsieur poirot , that you have _carte blanche_ in every way . ”
christie	styles	“ you are too amiable , madame. ” still beaming , poirot marshalled us all into the drawing-room , bringing forward chairs as he did so . “ miss howard—here . mademoiselle cynthia . monsieur lawrence . the good dorcas . and annie . _bien ! _ we must delay our proceedings a few minutes until mr. inglethorp arrives . i have sent him a note . ”
christie	styles	miss howard rose immediately from her seat . “ if that man comes into the house , i leave it ! ” “ no , no ! ” poirot went up to her and pleaded in a low voice .
christie	styles	finally miss howard consented to return to her chair . a few minutes later alfred inglethorp entered the room . the company once assembled , poirot rose from his seat with the air of a popular lecturer , and bowed politely to his audience .
christie	styles	“ _messieurs , mesdames_ , as you all know , i was called in by monsieur john cavendish to investigate this case . i at once examined the bedroom of the deceased which , by the advice of the doctors , had been kept locked , and was consequently exactly as it had been when the tragedy occurred . i found : first , a fragment of green material ; second , a stain on the carpet near the window , still damp ; thirdly , an empty box of bromide powders .
christie	styles	“ to take the fragment of green material first , i found it caught in the bolt of the communicating door between that room and the adjoining one occupied by mademoiselle cynthia . i handed the fragment over to the police who did not consider it of much importance . nor did they recognize it for what it was—a piece torn from a green land armlet . ”
christie	styles	there was a little stir of excitement . “ now there was only one person at styles who worked on the land—mrs . cavendish . therefore it must have been mrs. cavendish who entered the deceased ’ s room through the door communicating with mademoiselle cynthia ’ s room . ”
christie	styles	“ but that door was bolted on the inside ! ” i cried . “ when i examined the room , yes . but in the first place we have only her word for it , since it was she who tried that particular door and reported it fastened . in the ensuing confusion she would have had ample opportunity to shoot the bolt across . i took an early opportunity of verifying my conjectures . to begin with , the fragment corresponds exactly with a tear in mrs. cavendish ’ s armlet . also , at the inquest , mrs. cavendish declared that she had heard , from her own room , the fall of the table by the bed . i took an early opportunity of testing that statement by stationing my friend monsieur hastings in the left wing of the building , just outside mrs. cavendish ’ s door . i myself , in company with the police , went to the deceased ’ s room , and whilst there i , apparently accidentally , knocked over the table in question , but found that , as i had expected , monsieur hastings had heard no sound at all . this confirmed my belief that mrs. cavendish was not speaking the truth when she declared that she had been dressing in her room at the time of the tragedy . in fact , i was convinced that , far from having been in her own room , mrs. cavendish was actually in the deceased ’ s room when the alarm was given . ”
christie	styles	i shot a quick glance at mary . she was very pale , but smiling . “ i proceeded to reason on that assumption . mrs. cavendish is in her mother-in-law ’ s room . we will say that she is seeking for something and has not yet found it . suddenly mrs. inglethorp awakens and is seized with an alarming paroxysm . she flings out her arm , overturning the bed table , and then pulls desperately at the bell . mrs. cavendish , startled , drops her candle , scattering the grease on the carpet . she picks it up , and retreats quickly to mademoiselle cynthia ’ s room , closing the door behind her . she hurries out into the passage , for the servants must not find her where she is . but it is too late ! already footsteps are echoing along the gallery which connects the two wings . what can she do ? quick as thought , she hurries back to the young girl ’ s room , and starts shaking her awake . the hastily aroused household come trooping down the passage . they are all busily battering at mrs. inglethorp ’ s door . it occurs to nobody that mrs. cavendish has not arrived with the rest , but—and this is significant—i can find no one who saw her come from the other wing. ” he looked at mary cavendish . “ am i right , madame ? ”
christie	styles	she bowed her head . “ quite right , monsieur . you understand that , if i had thought i would do my husband any good by revealing these facts , i would have done so . but it did not seem to me to bear upon the question of his guilt or innocence . ”
christie	styles	“ in a sense , that is correct , madame . but it cleared my mind of many misconceptions , and left me free to see other facts in their true significance. ” “ the will ! ” cried lawrence . “ then it was you , mary , who destroyed the will ? ”
christie	styles	she shook her head , and poirot shook his also . “ no , ” he said quietly . “ there is only one person who could possibly have destroyed that will—mrs . inglethorp herself ! ” “ impossible ! ” i exclaimed . “ she had only made it out that very afternoon ! ”
christie	styles	“ nevertheless , _mon ami_ , it was mrs. inglethorp . because , in no other way can you account for the fact that , on one of the hottest days of the year , mrs. inglethorp ordered a fire to be lighted in her room . ”
christie	styles	i gave a gasp . what idiots we had been never to think of that fire as being incongruous ! poirot was continuing : “ the temperature on that day , messieurs , was 80 degrees in the shade . yet mrs. inglethorp ordered a fire ! why ? because she wished to destroy something , and could think of no other way . you will remember that , in consequence of the war economics practiced at styles , no waste paper was thrown away . there was therefore no means of destroying a thick document such as a will . the moment i heard of a fire being lighted in mrs. inglethorp ’ s room , i leaped to the conclusion that it was to destroy some important document—possibly a will . so the discovery of the charred fragment in the grate was no surprise to me . i did not , of course , know at the time that the will in question had only been made this afternoon , and i will admit that , when i learnt that fact , i fell into a grievous error . i came to the conclusion that mrs. inglethorp ’ s determination to destroy her will arose as a direct consequence of the quarrel she had that afternoon , and that therefore the quarrel took place after , and not before the making of the will .
christie	styles	“ here , as we know , i was wrong , and i was forced to abandon that idea . i faced the problem from a new standpoint . now , at four o ’ clock , dorcas overheard her mistress saying angrily : ‘ you need not think that any fear of publicity , or scandal between husband and wife will deter me. ” i conjectured , and conjectured rightly , that these words were addressed , not to her husband , but to mr. john cavendish . at five o ’ clock , an hour later , she uses almost the same words , but the standpoint is different . she admits to dorcas , ‘ i don ’ t know what to do ; scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing. ’ at four o ’ clock she has been angry , but completely mistress of herself . at five o ’ clock she is in violent distress , and speaks of having had a great shock .
christie	styles	“ looking at the matter psychologically , i drew one deduction which i was convinced was correct . the second ‘ scandal ’ she spoke of was not the same as the first—and it concerned herself !
christie	styles	“ let us reconstruct . at four o ’ clock , mrs. inglethorp quarrels with her son , and threatens to denounce him to his wife—who , by the way , overheard the greater part of the conversation . at four-thirty , mrs. inglethorp , in consequence of a conversation on the validity of wills , makes a will in favour of her husband , which the two gardeners witness . at five o ’ clock , dorcas finds her mistress in a state of considerable agitation , with a slip of paper— ‘ a letter , ’ dorcas thinks—in her hand , and it is then that she orders the fire in her room to be lighted . presumably , then , between four-thirty and five o ’ clock , something has occurred to occasion a complete revolution of feeling , since she is now as anxious to destroy the will , as she was before to make it . what was that something ?
christie	styles	“ as far as we know , she was quite alone during that half-hour . nobody entered or left that boudoir . what then occasioned this sudden change of sentiment ? “ one can only guess , but i believe my guess to be correct . mrs. inglethorp had no stamps in her desk . we know this , because later she asked dorcas to bring her some . now in the opposite corner of the room stood her husband ’ s desk—locked . she was anxious to find some stamps , and , according to my theory , she tried her own keys in the desk . that one of them fitted i know . she therefore opened the desk , and in searching for the stamps she came across something else—that slip of paper which dorcas saw in her hand , and which assuredly was never meant for mrs. inglethorp ’ s eyes . on the other hand , mrs. cavendish believed that the slip of paper to which her mother-in-law clung so tenaciously was a written proof of her own husband ’ s infidelity . she demanded it from mrs. inglethorp who assured her , quite truly , that it had nothing to do with that matter . mrs. cavendish did not believe her . she thought that mrs. inglethorp was shielding her stepson . now mrs. cavendish is a very resolute woman , and , behind her mask of reserve , she was madly jealous of her husband . she determined to get hold of that paper at all costs , and in this resolution chance came to her aid . she happened to pick up the key of mrs. inglethorp ’ s despatch-case , which had been lost that morning . she knew that her mother-in-law invariably kept all important papers in this particular case .
christie	styles	“ mrs . cavendish , therefore , made her plans as only a woman driven desperate through jealousy could have done . some time in the evening she unbolted the door leading into mademoiselle cynthia ’ s room . possibly she applied oil to the hinges , for i found that it opened quite noiselessly when i tried it . she put off her project until the early hours of the morning as being safer , since the servants were accustomed to hearing her move about her room at that time . she dressed completely in her land kit , and made her way quietly through mademoiselle cynthia ’ s room into that of mrs. inglethorp . ”
christie	styles	he paused a moment , and cynthia interrupted : “ but i should have woken up if anyone had come through my room ? ” “ not if you were drugged , mademoiselle. ” “ drugged ? ” “ _mais , oui ! _ ” “ you remember ” —he addressed us collectively again— “ that through all the tumult and noise next door mademoiselle cynthia slept . that admitted of two possibilities . either her sleep was feigned—which i did not believe—or her unconsciousness was induced by artificial means .
christie	styles	“ with this latter idea in my mind , i examined all the coffee-cups most carefully , remembering that it was mrs. cavendish who had brought mademoiselle cynthia her coffee the night before . i took a sample from each cup , and had them analysed—with no result . i had counted the cups carefully , in the event of one having been removed . six persons had taken coffee , and six cups were duly found . i had to confess myself mistaken .
christie	styles	“ then i discovered that i had been guilty of a very grave oversight . coffee had been brought in for seven persons , not six , for dr. bauerstein had been there that evening . this changed the face of the whole affair , for there was now one cup missing . the servants noticed nothing , since annie , the housemaid , who took in the coffee , brought in seven cups , not knowing that mr. inglethorp never drank it , whereas dorcas , who cleared them away the following morning , found six as usual—or strictly speaking she found five , the sixth being the one found broken in mrs. inglethorp ’ s room .
christie	styles	“ i was confident that the missing cup was that of mademoiselle cynthia . i had an additional reason for that belief in the fact that all the cups found contained sugar , which mademoiselle cynthia never took in her coffee . my attention was attracted by the story of annie about some ‘ salt ’ on the tray of cocoa which she took every night to mrs. inglethorp ’ s room . i accordingly secured a sample of that cocoa , and sent it to be analysed . ”
christie	styles	“ but that had already been done by dr. bauerstein , ” said lawrence quickly . “ not exactly . the analyst was asked by him to report whether strychnine was , or was not , present . he did not have it tested , as i did , for a narcotic . ”
christie	styles	“ for a narcotic ? ” “ yes . here is the analyst ’ s report . mrs. cavendish administered a safe , but effectual , narcotic to both mrs. inglethorp and mademoiselle cynthia . and it is possible that she had a _mauvais quart d ’ heure_ in consequence ! imagine her feelings when her mother-in-law is suddenly taken ill and dies , and immediately after she hears the word ‘ poison ’ ! she has believed that the sleeping draught she administered was perfectly harmless , but there is no doubt that for one terrible moment she must have feared that mrs. inglethorp ’ s death lay at her door . she is seized with panic , and under its influence she hurries downstairs , and quickly drops the coffee-cup and saucer used by mademoiselle cynthia into a large brass vase , where it is discovered later by monsieur lawrence . the remains of the cocoa she dare not touch . too many eyes are upon her . guess at her relief when strychnine is mentioned , and she discovers that after all the tragedy is not her doing .
christie	styles	“ we are now able to account for the symptoms of strychnine poisoning being so long in making their appearance . a narcotic taken with strychnine will delay the action of the poison for some hours . ”
christie	styles	poirot paused . mary looked up at him , the colour slowly rising in her face . “ all you have said is quite true , monsieur poirot . it was the most awful hour of my life . i shall never forget it . but you are wonderful . i understand now—— ”
christie	styles	“ what i meant when i told you that you could safely confess to papa poirot , eh ? but you would not trust me. ” “ i see everything now , ” said lawrence . “ the drugged cocoa , taken on top of the poisoned coffee , amply accounts for the delay . ”
christie	styles	“ exactly . but was the coffee poisoned , or was it not ? we come to a little difficulty here , since mrs. inglethorp never drank it. ” “ what ? ” the cry of surprise was universal .
christie	styles	“ no . you will remember my speaking of a stain on the carpet in mrs. inglethorp ’ s room ? there were some peculiar points about that stain . it was still damp , it exhaled a strong odour of coffee , and imbedded in the nap of the carpet i found some little splinters of china . what had happened was plain to me , for not two minutes before i had placed my little case on the table near the window , and the table , tilting up , had deposited it upon the floor on precisely the identical spot . in exactly the same way , mrs. inglethorp had laid down her cup of coffee on reaching her room the night before , and the treacherous table had played her the same trick .
christie	styles	“ what happened next is mere guess work on my part , but i should say that mrs. inglethorp picked up the broken cup and placed it on the table by the bed . feeling in need of a stimulant of some kind , she heated up her cocoa , and drank it off then and there . now we are faced with a new problem . we know the cocoa contained no strychnine . the coffee was never drunk . yet the strychnine must have been administered between seven and nine o ’ clock that evening . what third medium was there—a medium so suitable for disguising the taste of strychnine that it is extraordinary no one has thought of it ? ” poirot looked round the room , and then answered himself impressively . “ her medicine ! ”
christie	styles	“ do you mean that the murderer introduced the strychnine into her tonic ? ” i cried . “ there was no need to introduce it . it was already there—in the mixture . the strychnine that killed mrs. inglethorp was the identical strychnine prescribed by dr. wilkins . to make that clear to you , i will read you an extract from a book on dispensing which i found in the dispensary of the red cross hospital at tadminster :
christie	styles	“ ‘ the following prescription has become famous in text books : strychninae sulph . . . . . . 1 gr . potass bromide . . . . . . . 3vi aqua ad . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3viii
christie	styles	fiat mistura _this solution deposits in a few hours the greater part of the strychnine salt as an insoluble bromide in transparent crystals . a lady in england lost her life by taking a similar mixture : the precipitated strychnine collected at the bottom , and in taking the last dose she swallowed nearly all of it ! _
christie	styles	“ now there was , of course , no bromide in dr. wilkins ’ prescription , but you will remember that i mentioned an empty box of bromide powders . one or two of those powders introduced into the full bottle of medicine would effectually precipitate the strychnine , as the book describes , and cause it to be taken in the last dose . you will learn later that the person who usually poured out mrs. inglethorp ’ s medicine was always extremely careful not to shake the bottle , but to leave the sediment at the bottom of it undisturbed .
christie	styles	“ throughout the case , there have been evidences that the tragedy was intended to take place on monday evening . on that day , mrs. inglethorp ’ s bell wire was neatly cut , and on monday evening mademoiselle cynthia was spending the night with friends , so that mrs. inglethorp would have been quite alone in the right wing , completely shut off from help of any kind , and would have died , in all probability , before medical aid could have been summoned . but in her hurry to be in time for the village entertainment mrs. inglethorp forgot to take her medicine , and the next day she lunched away from home , so that the last—and fatal—dose was actually taken twenty-four hours later than had been anticipated by the murderer ; and it is owing to that delay that the final proof—the last link of the chain—is now in my hands . ”
christie	styles	amid breathless excitement , he held out three thin strips of paper . “ a letter in the murderer ’ s own hand-writing , _mes amis ! _ had it been a little clearer in its terms , it is possible that mrs. inglethorp , warned in time , would have escaped . as it was , she realized her danger , but not the manner of it . ”
christie	styles	in the deathly silence , poirot pieced together the slips of paper and , clearing his throat , read : dearest evelyn : ‘ you will be anxious at hearing nothing . it is all right—only it will be to-night instead of last night . you understand . there ’ s a good time coming once the old woman is dead and out of the way . no one can possibly bring home the crime to me . that idea of yours about the bromides was a stroke of genius ! but we must be very circumspect . a false step—— ’
christie	styles	“ here , my friends , the letter breaks off . doubtless the writer was interrupted ; but there can be no question as to his identity . we all know this hand-writing and—— ” a howl that was almost a scream broke the silence .
christie	styles	“ you devil ! how did you get it ? ” a chair was overturned . poirot skipped nimbly aside . a quick movement on his part , and his assailant fell with a crash . “ _messieurs , mesdames_ , ” said poirot , with a flourish , “ let me introduce you to the murderer , mr. alfred inglethorp ! ”
christie	styles	chapter xiii . poirot explains “ poirot , you old villain , ” i said , “ i ’ ve half a mind to strangle you ! what do you mean by deceiving me as you have done ? ” we were sitting in the library . several hectic days lay behind us . in the room below , john and mary were together once more , while alfred inglethorp and miss howard were in custody . now at last , i had poirot to myself , and could relieve my still burning curiosity .
christie	styles	poirot did not answer me for a moment , but at last he said : “ i did not deceive you , _mon ami_ . at most , i permitted you to deceive yourself. ” “ yes , but why ? ”
christie	styles	“ well , it is difficult to explain . you see , my friend , you have a nature so honest , and a countenance so transparent , that—_enfin_ , to conceal your feelings is impossible ! if i had told you my ideas , the very first time you saw mr. alfred inglethorp that astute gentleman would have—in your so expressive idiom— ‘ smelt a rat ’ ! and then , _bonjour_ to our chances of catching him ! ”
christie	styles	“ i think that i have more diplomacy than you give me credit for. ” “ my friend , ” besought poirot , “ i implore you , do not enrage yourself ! your help has been of the most invaluable . it is but the extremely beautiful nature that you have , which made me pause . ”
christie	styles	“ well , ” i grumbled , a little mollified . “ i still think you might have given me a hint. ” “ but i did , my friend . several hints . you would not take them . think now , did i ever say to you that i believed john cavendish guilty ? did i not , on the contrary , tell you that he would almost certainly be acquitted ? ”
christie	styles	“ yes , but—— ” “ and did i not immediately afterwards speak of the difficulty of bringing the murderer to justice ? was it not plain to you that i was speaking of two entirely different persons ? ”
christie	styles	“ no , ” i said , “ it was not plain to me ! ” “ then again , ” continued poirot , “ at the beginning , did i not repeat to you several times that i didn ’ t want mr. inglethorp arrested _now_ ? that should have conveyed something to you . ”
christie	styles	“ do you mean to say you suspected him as long ago as that ? ” “ yes . to begin with , whoever else might benefit by mrs. inglethorp ’ s death , her husband would benefit the most . there was no getting away from that . when i went up to styles with you that first day , i had no idea as to how the crime had been committed , but from what i knew of mr. inglethorp i fancied that it would be very hard to find anything to connect him with it . when i arrived at the château , i realized at once that it was mrs. inglethorp who had burnt the will ; and there , by the way , you can not complain , my friend , for i tried my best to force on you the significance of that bedroom fire in midsummer . ”
christie	styles	“ yes , yes , ” i said impatiently . “ go on. ” “ well , my friend , as i say , my views as to mr. inglethorp ’ s guilt were very much shaken . there was , in fact , so much evidence against him that i was inclined to believe that he had not done it . ”
christie	styles	“ when did you change your mind ? ” “ when i found that the more efforts i made to clear him , the more efforts he made to get himself arrested . then , when i discovered that inglethorp had nothing to do with mrs. raikes and that in fact it was john cavendish who was interested in that quarter , i was quite sure . ”
christie	styles	“ but why ? ” “ simply this . if it had been inglethorp who was carrying on an intrigue with mrs. raikes , his silence was perfectly comprehensible . but , when i discovered that it was known all over the village that it was john who was attracted by the farmer ’ s pretty wife , his silence bore quite a different interpretation . it was nonsense to pretend that he was afraid of the scandal , as no possible scandal could attach to him . this attitude of his gave me furiously to think , and i was slowly forced to the conclusion that alfred inglethorp wanted to be arrested . _eh bien ! _ from that moment , i was equally determined that he should not be arrested . ”
christie	styles	“ wait a minute . i don ’ t see why he wished to be arrested ? ” “ because , _mon ami_ , it is the law of your country that a man once acquitted can never be tried again for the same offence . aha ! but it was clever—his idea ! assuredly , he is a man of method . see here , he knew that in his position he was bound to be suspected , so he conceived the exceedingly clever idea of preparing a lot of manufactured evidence against himself . he wished to be arrested . he would then produce his irreproachable alibi—and , hey presto , he was safe for life ! ”
christie	styles	“ but i still don ’ t see how he managed to prove his alibi , and yet go to the chemist ’ s shop ? ” poirot stared at me in surprise . “ is it possible ? my poor friend ! you have not yet realized that it was miss howard who went to the chemist ’ s shop ? ”
christie	styles	“ miss howard ? ” “ but , certainly . who else ? it was most easy for her . she is of a good height , her voice is deep and manly ; moreover , remember , she and inglethorp are cousins , and there is a distinct resemblance between them , especially in their gait and bearing . it was simplicity itself . they are a clever pair ! ”
christie	styles	“ i am still a little fogged as to how exactly the bromide business was done , ” i remarked . “ _bon ! _ i will reconstruct for you as far as possible . i am inclined to think that miss howard was the master mind in that affair . you remember her once mentioning that her father was a doctor ? possibly she dispensed his medicines for him , or she may have taken the idea from one of the many books lying about when mademoiselle cynthia was studying for her exam . anyway , she was familiar with the fact that the addition of a bromide to a mixture containing strychnine would cause the precipitation of the latter . probably the idea came to her quite suddenly . mrs. inglethorp had a box of bromide powders , which she occasionally took at night . what could be easier than quietly to dissolve one or more of those powders in mrs. inglethorp ’ s large sized bottle of medicine when it came from coot ’ s ? the risk is practically nil . the tragedy will not take place until nearly a fortnight later . if anyone has seen either of them touching the medicine , they will have forgotten it by that time . miss howard will have engineered her quarrel , and departed from the house . the lapse of time , and her absence , will defeat all suspicion . yes , it was a clever idea ! if they had left it alone , it is possible the crime might never have been brought home to them . but they were not satisfied . they tried to be too clever—and that was their undoing . ”
christie	styles	poirot puffed at his tiny cigarette , his eyes fixed on the ceiling . “ they arranged a plan to throw suspicion on john cavendish , by buying strychnine at the village chemist ’ s , and signing the register in his hand-writing .
christie	styles	“ on monday mrs. inglethorp will take the last dose of her medicine . on monday , therefore , at six o ’ clock , alfred inglethorp arranges to be seen by a number of people at a spot far removed from the village . miss howard has previously made up a cock and bull story about him and mrs. raikes to account for his holding his tongue afterwards . at six o ’ clock , miss howard , disguised as alfred inglethorp , enters the chemist ’ s shop , with her story about a dog , obtains the strychnine , and writes the name of alfred inglethorp in john ’ s handwriting , which she had previously studied carefully .
christie	styles	“ but , as it will never do if john , too , can prove an alibi , she writes him an anonymous note—still copying his hand-writing—which takes him to a remote spot where it is exceedingly unlikely that anyone will see him .
christie	styles	“ so far , all goes well . miss howard goes back to middlingham . alfred inglethorp returns to styles . there is nothing that can compromise him in any way , since it is miss howard who has the strychnine , which , after all , is only wanted as a blind to throw suspicion on john cavendish .
christie	styles	“ but now a hitch occurs . mrs. inglethorp does not take her medicine that night . the broken bell , cynthia ’ s absence—arranged by inglethorp through his wife—all these are wasted . and then—he makes his slip .
christie	styles	“ mrs . inglethorp is out , and he sits down to write to his accomplice , who , he fears , may be in a panic at the non-success of their plan . it is probable that mrs. inglethorp returned earlier than he expected . caught in the act , and somewhat flurried he hastily shuts and locks his desk . he fears that if he remains in the room he may have to open it again , and that mrs. inglethorp might catch sight of the letter before he could snatch it up . so he goes out and walks in the woods , little dreaming that mrs. inglethorp will open his desk , and discover the incriminating document .
christie	styles	“ but this , as we know , is what happened . mrs. inglethorp reads it , and becomes aware of the perfidy of her husband and evelyn howard , though , unfortunately , the sentence about the bromides conveys no warning to her mind . she knows that she is in danger—but is ignorant of where the danger lies . she decides to say nothing to her husband , but sits down and writes to her solicitor , asking him to come on the morrow , and she also determines to destroy immediately the will which she has just made . she keeps the fatal letter . ”
christie	styles	“ it was to discover that letter , then , that her husband forced the lock of the despatch-case ? ” “ yes , and from the enormous risk he ran we can see how fully he realized its importance . that letter excepted , there was absolutely nothing to connect him with the crime . ”
christie	styles	“ there ’ s only one thing i can ’ t make out , why didn ’ t he destroy it at once when he got hold of it ? ” “ because he did not dare take the biggest risk of all—that of keeping it on his own person . ”
christie	styles	“ i don ’ t understand. ” “ look at it from his point of view . i have discovered that there were only five short minutes in which he could have taken it—the five minutes immediately before our own arrival on the scene , for before that time annie was brushing the stairs , and would have seen anyone who passed going to the right wing . figure to yourself the scene ! he enters the room , unlocking the door by means of one of the other doorkeys—they were all much alike . he hurries to the despatch-case—it is locked , and the keys are nowhere to be seen . that is a terrible blow to him , for it means that his presence in the room can not be concealed as he had hoped . but he sees clearly that everything must be risked for the sake of that damning piece of evidence . quickly , he forces the lock with a penknife , and turns over the papers until he finds what he is looking for .
christie	styles	“ but now a fresh dilemma arises : he dare not keep that piece of paper on him . he may be seen leaving the room—he may be searched . if the paper is found on him , it is certain doom . probably , at this minute , too , he hears the sounds below of mr. wells and john leaving the boudoir . he must act quickly . where can he hide this terrible slip of paper ? the contents of the waste-paper-basket are kept and in any case , are sure to be examined . there are no means of destroying it ; and he dare not keep it . he looks round , and he sees—what do you think , _mon ami ? _ ”
christie	styles	i shook my head . “ in a moment , he has torn the letter into long thin strips , and rolling them up into spills he thrusts them hurriedly in amongst the other spills in the vase on the mantle-piece . ”
christie	styles	i uttered an exclamation . “ no one would think of looking there , ” poirot continued . “ and he will be able , at his leisure , to come back and destroy this solitary piece of evidence against him . ”
christie	styles	“ then , all the time , it was in the spill vase in mrs. inglethorp ’ s bedroom , under our very noses ? ” i cried . poirot nodded . “ yes , my friend . that is where i discovered my ‘ last link , ’ and i owe that very fortunate discovery to you . ”
christie	styles	“ to me ? ” “ yes . do you remember telling me that my hand shook as i was straightening the ornaments on the mantelpiece ? ” “ yes , but i don ’ t see—— ” “ no , but i saw . do you know , my friend , i remembered that earlier in the morning , when we had been there together , i had straightened all the objects on the mantelpiece . and , if they were already straightened , there would be no need to straighten them again , unless , in the meantime , someone else had touched them . ”
christie	styles	“ dear me , ” i murmured , “ so that is the explanation of your extraordinary behaviour . you rushed down to styles , and found it still there ? ” “ yes , and it was a race for time . ”
christie	styles	“ but i still can ’ t understand why inglethorp was such a fool as to leave it there when he had plenty of opportunity to destroy it. ” “ ah , but he had no opportunity . _i_ saw to that . ”
christie	styles	“ you ? ” “ yes . do you remember reproving me for taking the household into my confidence on the subject ? ” “ yes. ” “ well , my friend , i saw there was just one chance . i was not sure then if inglethorp was the criminal or not , but if he was i reasoned that he would not have the paper on him , but would have hidden it somewhere , and by enlisting the sympathy of the household i could effectually prevent his destroying it . he was already under suspicion , and by making the matter public i secured the services of about ten amateur detectives , who would be watching him unceasingly , and being himself aware of their watchfulness he would not dare seek further to destroy the document . he was therefore forced to depart from the house , leaving it in the spill vase . ”
christie	styles	“ but surely miss howard had ample opportunities of aiding him. ” “ yes , but miss howard did not know of the paper ’ s existence . in accordance with their prearranged plan , she never spoke to alfred inglethorp . they were supposed to be deadly enemies , and until john cavendish was safely convicted they neither of them dared risk a meeting . of course i had a watch kept on mr. inglethorp , hoping that sooner or later he would lead me to the hiding-place . but he was too clever to take any chances . the paper was safe where it was ; since no one had thought of looking there in the first week , it was not likely they would do so afterwards . but for your lucky remark , we might never have been able to bring him to justice . ”
christie	styles	“ i understand that now ; but when did you first begin to suspect miss howard ? ” “ when i discovered that she had told a lie at the inquest about the letter she had received from mrs. inglethorp . ”
christie	styles	“ why , what was there to lie about ? ” “ you saw that letter ? do you recall its general appearance ? ” “ yes—more or less. ” “ you will recollect , then , that mrs. inglethorp wrote a very distinctive hand , and left large clear spaces between her words . but if you look at the date at the top of the letter you will notice that ‘ july 17th ’ is quite different in this respect . do you see what i mean ? ”
christie	styles	“ no , ” i confessed , “ i don ’ t. ” “ you do not see that that letter was not written on the 17th , but on the 7th—the day after miss howard ’ s departure ? the ‘ 1 ’ was written in before the ‘ 7 ’ to turn it into the ‘ 17th ’ . ”
christie	styles	“ but why ? ” “ that is exactly what i asked myself . why does miss howard suppress the letter written on the 17th , and produce this faked one instead ? because she did not wish to show the letter of the 17th . why , again ? and at once a suspicion dawned in my mind . you will remember my saying that it was wise to beware of people who were not telling you the truth . ”
christie	styles	“ and yet , ” i cried indignantly , “ after that , you gave me two reasons why miss howard could not have committed the crime ! ” “ and very good reasons too , ” replied poirot . “ for a long time they were a stumbling-block to me until i remembered a very significant fact : that she and alfred inglethorp were cousins . she could not have committed the crime single-handed , but the reasons against that did not debar her from being an accomplice . and , then , there was that rather over-vehement hatred of hers ! it concealed a very opposite emotion . there was , undoubtedly , a tie of passion between them long before he came to styles . they had already arranged their infamous plot—that he should marry this rich , but rather foolish old lady , induce her to make a will leaving her money to him , and then gain their ends by a very cleverly conceived crime . if all had gone as they planned , they would probably have left england , and lived together on their poor victim ’ s money .
christie	styles	“ they are a very astute and unscrupulous pair . while suspicion was to be directed against him , she would be making quiet preparations for a very different _dénouement_ . she arrives from middlingham with all the compromising items in her possession . no suspicion attaches to her . no notice is paid to her coming and going in the house . she hides the strychnine and glasses in john ’ s room . she puts the beard in the attic . she will see to it that sooner or later they are duly discovered . ”
christie	styles	“ i don ’ t quite see why they tried to fix the blame on john , ” i remarked . “ it would have been much easier for them to bring the crime home to lawrence . ”
christie	styles	“ yes , but that was mere chance . all the evidence against him arose out of pure accident . it must , in fact , have been distinctly annoying to the pair of schemers. ” “ his manner was unfortunate , ” i observed thoughtfully .
christie	styles	“ yes . you realize , of course , what was at the back of that ? ” “ no. ” “ you did not understand that he believed mademoiselle cynthia guilty of the crime ? ” “ no , ” i exclaimed , astonished . “ impossible ! ”
christie	styles	“ not at all . i myself nearly had the same idea . it was in my mind when i asked mr. wells that first question about the will . then there were the bromide powders which she had made up , and her clever male impersonations , as dorcas recounted them to us . there was really more evidence against her than anyone else . ”
christie	styles	“ you are joking , poirot ! ” “ no . shall i tell you what made monsieur lawrence turn so pale when he first entered his mother ’ s room on the fatal night ? it was because , whilst his mother lay there , obviously poisoned , he saw , over your shoulder , that the door into mademoiselle cynthia ’ s room was unbolted . ”
christie	styles	“ but he declared that he saw it bolted ! ” i cried . “ exactly , ” said poirot dryly . “ and that was just what confirmed my suspicion that it was not . he was shielding mademoiselle cynthia . ”
christie	styles	“ but why should he shield her ? ” “ because he is in love with her. ” i laughed . “ there , poirot , you are quite wrong ! i happen to know for a fact that , far from being in love with her , he positively dislikes her . ”
christie	styles	“ who told you that , _mon ami ? _ ” “ cynthia herself. ” “ _la pauvre petite ! _ and she was concerned ? ” “ she said that she did not mind at all. ” “ then she certainly did mind very much , ” remarked poirot . “ they are like that—_les femmes ! _ ”
christie	styles	“ what you say about lawrence is a great surprise to me , ” i said . “ but why ? it was most obvious . did not monsieur lawrence make the sour face every time mademoiselle cynthia spoke and laughed with his brother ? he had taken it into his long head that mademoiselle cynthia was in love with monsieur john . when he entered his mother ’ s room , and saw her obviously poisoned , he jumped to the conclusion that mademoiselle cynthia knew something about the matter . he was nearly driven desperate . first he crushed the coffee-cup to powder under his feet , remembering that _she_ had gone up with his mother the night before , and he determined that there should be no chance of testing its contents . thenceforward , he strenuously , and quite uselessly , upheld the theory of ‘ death from natural causes ’ . ”
christie	styles	“ and what about the ‘ extra coffee-cup ’ ? ” “ i was fairly certain that it was mrs. cavendish who had hidden it , but i had to make sure . monsieur lawrence did not know at all what i meant ; but , on reflection , he came to the conclusion that if he could find an extra coffee-cup anywhere his lady love would be cleared of suspicion . and he was perfectly right . ”
christie	styles	“ one thing more . what did mrs. inglethorp mean by her dying words ? ” “ they were , of course , an accusation against her husband. ” “ dear me , poirot , ” i said with a sigh , “ i think you have explained everything . i am glad it has all ended so happily . even john and his wife are reconciled . ”
christie	styles	“ thanks to me. ” “ how do you mean—thanks to you ? ” “ my dear friend , do you not realize that it was simply and solely the trial which has brought them together again ? that john cavendish still loved his wife , i was convinced . also , that she was equally in love with him . but they had drifted very far apart . it all arose from a misunderstanding . she married him without love . he knew it . he is a sensitive man in his way , he would not force himself upon her if she did not want him . and , as he withdrew , her love awoke . but they are both unusually proud , and their pride held them inexorably apart . he drifted into an entanglement with mrs. raikes , and she deliberately cultivated the friendship of dr. bauerstein . do you remember the day of john cavendish ’ s arrest , when you found me deliberating over a big decision ? ”
christie	styles	“ yes , i quite understood your distress. ” “ pardon me , _mon ami_ , but you did not understand it in the least . i was trying to decide whether or not i would clear john cavendish at once . i could have cleared him—though it might have meant a failure to convict the real criminals . they were entirely in the dark as to my real attitude up to the very last moment—which partly accounts for my success . ”
christie	styles	“ do you mean that you could have saved john cavendish from being brought to trial ? ” “ yes , my friend . but i eventually decided in favour of ‘ a woman ’ s happiness ’ . nothing but the great danger through which they have passed could have brought these two proud souls together again . ”
christie	styles	i looked at poirot in silent amazement . the colossal cheek of the little man ! who on earth but poirot would have thought of a trial for murder as a restorer of conjugal happiness !
christie	styles	“ i perceive your thoughts , _mon ami_ , ” said poirot , smiling at me . “ no one but hercule poirot would have attempted such a thing ! and you are wrong in condemning it . the happiness of one man and one woman is the greatest thing in all the world . ”
christie	styles	his words took me back to earlier events . i remembered mary as she lay white and exhausted on the sofa , listening , listening . there had come the sound of the bell below . she had started up . poirot had opened the door , and meeting her agonized eyes had nodded gently . “ yes , madame , ” he said . “ i have brought him back to you. ” he had stood aside , and as i went out i had seen the look in mary ’ s eyes , as john cavendish had caught his wife in his arms .
christie	styles	“ perhaps you are right , poirot , ” i said gently . “ yes , it is the greatest thing in the world. ” suddenly , there was a tap at the door , and cynthia peeped in . “ i—i only—— ”
christie	styles	“ come in , ” i said , springing up . she came in , but did not sit down . “ i—only wanted to tell you something—— ” “ yes ? ” cynthia fidgeted with a little tassel for some moments , then , suddenly exclaiming : “ you dears ! ” kissed first me and then poirot , and rushed out of the room again .
christie	styles	“ what on earth does this mean ? ” i asked , surprised . it was very nice to be kissed by cynthia , but the publicity of the salute rather impaired the pleasure . “ it means that she has discovered monsieur lawrence does not dislike her as much as she thought , ” replied poirot philosophically .
christie	styles	“ but—— ” “ here he is. ” lawrence at that moment passed the door . “ eh ! monsieur lawrence , ” called poirot . “ we must congratulate you , is it not so ? ” lawrence blushed , and then smiled awkwardly . a man in love is a sorry spectacle . now cynthia had looked charming .
christie	styles	i sighed . “ what is it , _mon ami ? _ ” “ nothing , ” i said sadly . “ they are two delightful women ! ” “ and neither of them is for you ? ” finished poirot . “ never mind . console yourself , my friend . we may hunt together again , who knows ? and then—— ”
melville	moby	“ and what dost thou want of captain ahab ? it ’ s all right enough ; thou art shipped. ” “ yes , but i should like to see him. ” “ but i don ’ t think thou wilt be able to at present . i don ’ t know exactly what ’ s the matter with him ; but he keeps close inside the house ; a sort of sick , and yet he don ’ t look so . in fact , he ain ’ t sick ; but no , he isn ’ t well either . any how , young man , he won ’ t always see me , so i don ’ t suppose he will thee . he ’ s a queer man , captain ahab—so some think—but a good one . oh , thou ’ lt like him well enough ; no fear , no fear . he ’ s a grand , ungodly , god-like man , captain ahab ; doesn ’ t speak much ; but , when he does speak , then you may well listen . mark ye , be forewarned ; ahab ’ s above the common ; ahab ’ s been in colleges , as well as ’ mong the cannibals ; been used to deeper wonders than the waves ; fixed his fiery lance in mightier , stranger foes than whales . his lance ! aye , the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle ! oh ! he ain ’ t captain bildad ; no , and he ain ’ t captain peleg ; _he ’ s ahab_ , boy ; and ahab of old , thou knowest , was a crowned king ! ”

melville	moby	in 1778 , a fine ship , the amelia , fitted out for the express purpose , and at the sole charge of the vigorous enderbys , boldly rounded cape horn , and was the first among the nations to lower a whale-boat of any sort in the great south sea . the voyage was a skilful and lucky one ; and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm , the amelia ’ s example was soon followed by other ships , english and american , and thus the vast sperm whale grounds of the pacific were thrown open . but not content with this good deed , the indefatigable house again bestirred itself : samuel and all his sons—how many , their mother only knows—and under their immediate auspices , and partly , i think , at their expense , the british government was induced to send the sloop-of-war rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the south sea . commanded by a naval post-captain , the rattler made a rattling voyage of it , and did some service ; how much does not appear . but this is not all . in 1819 , the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own , to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of japan . that ship—well called the “ syren ” —made a noble experimental cruise ; and it was thus that the great japanese whaling ground first became generally known . the syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a captain coffin , a nantucketer .

melville	moby	but had stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate ? no ; he did not mean to , at least . because there were two boats in his wake , and he supposed , no doubt , that they would of course come up to pip very quickly , and pick him up ; though , indeed , such considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity , is not always manifested by the hunters in all similar instances ; and such instances not unfrequently occur ; almost invariably in the fishery , a coward , so called , is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies and armies .

melville	moby	crowding all sail the pequod pressed after them ; the harpooneers handling their weapons , and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet suspended boats . if the wind only held , little doubt had they , that chased through these straits of sunda , the vast host would only deploy into the oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their number . and who could tell whether , in that congregated caravan , moby dick himself might not temporarily be swimming , like the worshipped white-elephant in the coronation procession of the siamese ! so with stun-sail piled on stun-sail , we sailed along , driving these leviathans before us ; when , of a sudden , the voice of tashtego was heard , loudly directing attention to something in our wake .
melville	moby	the first uprising momentum of the whale—modifying its direction as he struck the surface—involuntarily launched him along it , to a little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made ; and with his back to it , he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from side to side ; and whenever a stray oar , bit of plank , the least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin , his tail swiftly drew back , and came sideways smiting the sea . but soon , as if satisfied that his work for that time was done , he pushed his pleated forehead through the ocean , and trailing after him the intertangled lines , continued his leeward way at a traveller ’ s methodic pace .

melville	moby	“ freely depicted in his own vocation , gentlemen , the canaller would make a fine dramatic hero , so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is he . like mark antony , for days and days along his green-turfed , flowery nile , he indolently floats , openly toying with his red-cheeked cleopatra , ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck . but ashore , all this effeminacy is dashed . the brigandish guise which the canaller so proudly sports ; his slouched and gaily-ribboned hat betoken his grand features . a terror to the smiling innocence of the villages through which he floats ; his swart visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities . once a vagabond on his own canal , i have received good turns from one of these canallers ; i thank him heartily ; would fain be not ungrateful ; but it is often one of the prime redeeming qualities of your man of violence , that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait , as to plunder a wealthy one . in sum , gentlemen , what the wildness of this canal life is , is emphatically evinced by this ; that our wild whale-fishery contains so many of its most finished graduates , and that scarce any race of mankind , except sydney men , are so much distrusted by our whaling captains . nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter , that to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line , the probationary life of the grand canal furnishes the sole transition between quietly reaping in a christian corn-field , and recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas .

melville	moby	oh , grassy glades ! oh , ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul ; in ye , —though long parched by the dead drought of the earthy life , —in ye , men yet may roll , like young horses in new morning clover ; and for some few fleeting moments , feel the cool dew of the life immortal on them . would to god these blessed calms would last . but the mingled , mingling threads of life are woven by warp and woof : calms crossed by storms , a storm for every calm . there is no steady unretracing progress in this life ; we do not advance through fixed gradations , and at the last one pause : —through infancy ’ s unconscious spell , boyhood ’ s thoughtless faith , adolescence ’ doubt ( the common doom ) , then scepticism , then disbelief , resting at last in manhood ’ s pondering repose of if . but once gone through , we trace the round again ; and are infants , boys , and men , and ifs eternally . where lies the final harbor , whence we unmoor no more ? in what rapt ether sails the world , of which the weariest will never weary ? where is the foundling ’ s father hidden ? our souls are like those orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them : the secret of our paternity lies in their grave , and we must there to learn it .

melville	moby	but here is an artist . he desires to paint you the dreamiest , shadiest , quietest , most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the saco . what is the chief element he employs ? there stand his trees , each with a hollow trunk , as if a hermit and a crucifix were within ; and here sleeps his meadow , and there sleep his cattle ; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke . deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way , reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue . but though the picture lies thus tranced , and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd ’ s head , yet all were vain , unless the shepherd ’ s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him . go visit the prairies in june , when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among tiger-lilies—what is the one charm wanting ? —water—there is not a drop of water there ! were niagara but a cataract of sand , would you travel your thousand miles to see it ? why did the poor poet of tennessee , upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver , deliberate whether to buy him a coat , which he sadly needed , or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to rockaway beach ? why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him , at some time or other crazy to go to sea ? why upon your first voyage as a passenger , did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration , when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land ? why did the old persians hold the sea holy ? why did the greeks give it a separate deity , and own brother of jove ? surely all this is not without meaning . and still deeper the meaning of that story of narcissus , who because he could not grasp the tormenting , mild image he saw in the fountain , plunged into it and was drowned . but that same image , we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans . it is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life ; and this is the key to it all .
melville	moby	book iii . ( _duodecimo_ ) , chapter iii . ( _mealy-mouthed porpoise_ ) .—the largest kind of porpoise ; and only found in the pacific , so far as it is known . the only english name , by which he has hitherto been designated , is that of the fishers—right-whale porpoise , from the circumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that folio . in shape , he differs in some degree from the huzza porpoise , being of a less rotund and jolly girth ; indeed , he is of quite a neat and gentleman-like figure . he has no fins on his back ( most other porpoises have ) , he has a lovely tail , and sentimental indian eyes of a hazel hue . but his mealy-mouth spoils all . though his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable , yet a boundary line , distinct as the mark in a ship ’ s hull , called the “ bright waist , ” that line streaks him from stem to stern , with two separate colours , black above and white below . the white comprises part of his head , and the whole of his mouth , which makes him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a meal-bag . a most mean and mealy aspect ! his oil is much like that of the common porpoise .
melville	moby	“ what do you mean by that , captain peleg ? ” said i , now jumping on the bulwarks , and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf . “ i mean , ” he replied , “ he must show his papers . ”
melville	moby	“ hast seen the white whale ? ” “ look ! ” replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail ; and with his trumpet he pointed to the wreck . “ hast killed him ? ” “ the harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that , ” answered the other , sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck , whose gathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together .
melville	moby	ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of the chase , for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving his orders in person , yet for captain ahab to have a boat actually apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt—above all for captain ahab to be supplied with five extra men , as that same boat ’ s crew , he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads of the owners of the pequod . therefore he had not solicited a boat ’ s crew from them , nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head . nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all that matter . until cabaco ’ s published discovery , the sailors had little foreseen it , though to be sure when , after being a little while out of port , all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting the whaleboats for service ; when some time after this ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in the matter of making thole-pins with his own hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats , and even solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers , which when the line is running out are pinned over the groove in the bow : when all this was observed in him , and particularly his solicitude in having an extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat , as if to make it better withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb ; and also the anxiety he evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board , or clumsy cleat , as it is sometimes called , the horizontal piece in the boat ’ s bow for bracing the knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale ; when it was observed how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the semi-circular depression in the cleat , and with the carpenter ’ s chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there ; all these things , i say , had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time . but almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness in ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of moby dick ; for he had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person . but such a supposition did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any boat ’ s crew being assigned to that boat .
melville	moby	the whole calamity , with the falling form of macey , was plainly descried from the ship . raising a piercing shriek— “ the vial ! the vial ! ” gabriel called off the terror-stricken crew from the further hunting of the whale . this terrible event clothed the archangel with added influence ; because his credulous disciples believed that he had specifically fore-announced it , instead of only making a general prophecy , which any one might have done , and so have chanced to hit one of many marks in the wide margin allowed . he became a nameless terror to the ship .
melville	moby	we then turned over the book together , and i endeavored to explain to him the purpose of the printing , and the meaning of the few pictures that were in it . thus i soon engaged his interest ; and from that we went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen in this famous town . soon i proposed a social smoke ; and , producing his pouch and tomahawk , he quietly offered me a puff . and then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his , and keeping it regularly passing between us .
melville	moby	“ pull , pull , my fine hearts-alive ; pull , my children ; pull , my little ones , ” drawlingly and soothingly sighed stubb to his crew , some of whom still showed signs of uneasiness . “ why don ’ t you break your backbones , my boys ? what is it you stare at ? those chaps in yonder boat ? tut ! they are only five more hands come to help us—never mind from where—the more the merrier . pull , then , do pull ; never mind the brimstone—devils are good fellows enough . so , so ; there you are now ; that ’ s the stroke for a thousand pounds ; that ’ s the stroke to sweep the stakes ! hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil , my heroes ! three cheers , men—all hearts alive ! easy , easy ; don ’ t be in a hurry—don ’ t be in a hurry . why don ’ t you snap your oars , you rascals ? bite something , you dogs ! so , so , so , then : —softly , softly ! that ’ s it—that ’ s it ! long and strong . give way there , give way ! the devil fetch ye , ye ragamuffin rapscallions ; ye are all asleep . stop snoring , ye sleepers , and pull . pull , will ye ? pull , can ’ t ye ? pull , won ’ t ye ? why in the name of gudgeons and ginger-cakes don ’ t ye pull ? —pull and break something ! pull , and start your eyes out ! here ! ” whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle ; “ every mother ’ s son of ye draw his knife , and pull with the blade between his teeth . that ’ s it—that ’ s it . now ye do something ; that looks like it , my steel-bits . start her—start her , my silver-spoons ! start her , marling-spikes ! ”
melville	moby	both were silent again , as one man . the grey dawn came on , and the slumbering crew arose from the boat ’ s bottom , and ere noon the dead whale was brought to the ship .
melville	moby	now , as it shortly turned out , what made this incident of the rachel ’ s the more melancholy , was the circumstance , that not only was one of the captain ’ s sons among the number of the missing boat ’ s crew ; but among the number of the other boat ’ s crews , at the same time , but on the other hand , separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the chase , there had been still another son ; as that for a time , the wretched father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity ; which was only solved for him by his chief mate ’ s instinctively adopting the ordinary procedure of a whale-ship in such emergencies , that is , when placed between jeopardized but divided boats , always to pick up the majority first . but the captain , for some unknown constitutional reason , had refrained from mentioning all this , and not till forced to it by ahab ’ s iciness did he allude to his one yet missing boy ; a little lad , but twelve years old , whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a nantucketer ’ s paternal love , had thus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders of a vocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race . nor does it unfrequently occur , that nantucket captains will send a son of such tender age away from them , for a protracted three or four years ’ voyage in some other ship than their own ; so that their first knowledge of a whaleman ’ s career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a father ’ s natural but untimely partiality , or undue apprehensiveness and concern .
melville	moby	these temporary apprehensions , so vague but so awful , derived a wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather , in which , beneath all its blue blandness , some thought there lurked a devilish charm , as for days and days we voyaged along , through seas so wearily , lonesomely mild , that all space , in repugnance to our vengeful errand , seemed vacating itself of life before our urn-like prow .
melville	moby	at last his spout grew thick , and with a frightful roll and vomit , he turned upon his back a corpse . while the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes , and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing , some conversation ensued between them .
melville	moby	“ but though the lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of passiveness in their conduct , he kept his own counsel ( at least till all was over ) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart . he was in radney the chief mate ’ s watch ; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom , after the scene at the rigging , he insisted , against the express counsel of the captain , upon resuming the head of his watch at night . upon this , and one or two other circumstances , steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge .
melville	moby	nor when expandingly lifted by your subject , can you fail to trace out great whales in the starry heavens , and boats in pursuit of them ; as when long filled with thoughts of war the eastern nations saw armies locked in battle among the clouds . thus at the north have i chased leviathan round and round the pole with the revolutions of the bright points that first defined him to me . and beneath the effulgent antarctic skies i have boarded the argo-navis , and joined the chase against the starry cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of hydrus and the flying fish .
melville	moby	now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf ; a sullen white surf beat against its steep sides ; then all collapsed , and the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago .
melville	moby	“ i don ’ t know that , my little man ; i never yet saw him kneel. ” among whale-wise people it has often been argued whether , considering the paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage , it is right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active perils of the chase . so tamerlane ’ s soldiers often argued with tears in their eyes , whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried into the thickest of the fight .
melville	moby	“ me sabbee plenty ” —grunted queequeg , puffing away at his pipe and sitting up in bed . “ you gettee in , ” he added , motioning to me with his tomahawk , and throwing the clothes to one side . he really did this in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way . i stood looking at him a moment . for all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean , comely looking cannibal . what ’ s all this fuss i have been making about , thought i to myself—the man ’ s a human being just as i am : he has just as much reason to fear me , as i have to be afraid of him . better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken christian .
melville	moby	“ well , then , ” interrupted bunger , “ give him your left arm for bait to get the right . do you know , gentlemen ” —very gravely and mathematically bowing to each captain in succession— “ do you know , gentlemen , that the digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by divine providence , that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest even a man ’ s arm ? and he knows it too . so that what you take for the white whale ’ s malice is only his awkwardness . for he never means to swallow a single limb ; he only thinks to terrify by feints . but sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow , formerly a patient of mine in ceylon , that making believe swallow jack-knives , once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest , and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more ; when i gave him an emetic , and he heaved it up in small tacks , d ’ ye see . no possible way for him to digest that jack-knife , and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system . yes , captain boomer , if you are quick enough about it , and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial to the other , why in that case the arm is yours ; only let the whale have another chance at you shortly , that ’ s all . ”
melville	moby	those narrow straits of sunda divide sumatra from java ; and standing midway in that vast rampart of islands , buttressed by that bold green promontory , known to seamen as java head ; they not a little correspond to the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire : and considering the inexhaustible wealth of spices , and silks , and jewels , and gold , and ivory , with which the thousand islands of that oriental sea are enriched , it seems a significant provision of nature , that such treasures , by the very formation of the land , should at least bear the appearance , however ineffectual , of being guarded from the all-grasping western world . the shores of the straits of sunda are unsupplied with those domineering fortresses which guard the entrances to the mediterranean , the baltic , and the propontis . unlike the danes , these orientals do not demand the obsequious homage of lowered top-sails from the endless procession of ships before the wind , which for centuries past , by night and by day , have passed between the islands of sumatra and java , freighted with the costliest cargoes of the east . but while they freely waive a ceremonial like this , they do by no means renounce their claim to more solid tribute .
melville	moby	besides , when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another , the sperm whales , guided by some infallible instinct—say , rather , secret intelligence from the deity—mostly swim in _veins_ , as they are called ; continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such undeviating exactitude , that no ship ever sailed her course , by any chart , with one tithe of such marvellous precision . though , in these cases , the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor ’ s parallel , and though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own unavoidable , straight wake , yet the arbitrary _vein_ in which at these times he is said to swim , generally embraces some few miles in width ( more or less , as the vein is presumed to expand or contract ) ; but never exceeds the visual sweep from the whale-ship ’ s mast-heads , when circumspectly gliding along this magic zone . the sum is , that at particular seasons within that breadth and along that path , migrating whales may with great confidence be looked for .
melville	moby	tashtego stood in the bows . he was full of the fire of the hunt . he hated pip for a poltroon . snatching the boat-knife from its sheath , he suspended its sharp edge over the line , and turning towards stubb , exclaimed interrogatively , “ cut ? ” meantime pip ’ s blue , choked face plainly looked , do , for god ’ s sake ! all passed in a flash . in less than half a minute , this entire thing happened .
melville	moby	all . a row ! a row ! a row ! tashtego ( _with a whiff_ ) . a row a ’ low , and a row aloft—gods and men—both brawlers ! humph ! belfast sailor . a row ! arrah a row ! the virgin be blessed , a row ! plunge in with ye !
melville	moby	“ they have , they have . i have seen them—some summer days in the morning . about this time—yes , it is his noon nap now—the boy vivaciously wakes ; sits up in bed ; and his mother tells him of me , of cannibal old me ; how i am abroad upon the deep , but will yet come back to dance him again . ”
melville	moby	shaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket , i seated myself near the door , and turning sideways was surprised to see queequeg near me . affected by the solemnity of the scene , there was a wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance . this savage was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance ; because he was the only one who could not read , and , therefore , was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall . whether any of the relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among the congregation , i knew not ; but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery , and so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing grief , that i feel sure that here before me were assembled those , in whose unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh .
melville	moby	“ he goes aft . that was sudden , now ; but squalls come sudden in hot latitudes . i ’ ve heard that the isle of albemarle , one of the gallipagos , is cut by the equator right in the middle . seems to me some sort of equator cuts yon old man , too , right in his middle . he ’ s always under the line—fiery hot , i tell ye ! he ’ s looking this way—come , oakum ; quick . here we go again . this wooden mallet is the cork , and i ’ m the professor of musical glasses—tap , tap ! ”
melville	moby	be it known that , waiving all argument , i take the good old fashioned ground that the whale is a fish , and call upon holy jonah to back me . this fundamental thing settled , the next point is , in what internal respect does the whale differ from other fish . above , linnæus has given you those items . but in brief , they are these : lungs and warm blood ; whereas , all other fish are lungless and cold blooded .
melville	moby	while the two crews were yet circling in the waters , reaching out after the revolving line-tubs , oars , and other floating furniture , while aslope little flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial , twitching his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks ; and stubb was lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up ; and while the old man ’ s line—now parting—admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to rescue whom he could ; —in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand concreted perils , —ahab ’ s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards heaven by invisible wires , —as , arrow-like , shooting perpendicularly from the sea , the white whale dashed his broad forehead against its bottom , and sent it , turning over and over , into the air ; till it fell again—gunwale downwards—and ahab and his men struggled out from under it , like seals from a sea-side cave .
melville	moby	“ now , as you well know , it is not seldom the case in this conventional world of ours—watery or otherwise ; that when a person placed in command over his fellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his superior in general pride of manhood , straightway against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness ; and if he have a chance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern ’ s tower , and make a little heap of dust of it . be this conceit of mine as it may , gentlemen , at all events steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a head like a roman , and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings of your last viceroy ’ s snorting charger ; and a brain , and a heart , and a soul in him , gentlemen , which had made steelkilt charlemagne , had he been born son to charlemagne ’ s father . but radney , the mate , was ugly as a mule ; yet as hardy , as stubborn , as malicious . he did not love steelkilt , and steelkilt knew it .

melville	moby	chapter 28 . ahab . for several days after leaving nantucket , nothing above hatches was seen of captain ahab . the mates regularly relieved each other at the watches , and for aught that could be seen to the contrary , they seemed to be the only commanders of the ship ; only they sometimes issued from the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory , that after all it was plain they but commanded vicariously . yes , their supreme lord and dictator was there , though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin .
melville	moby	a tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry ; the door was flung open , and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough . enveloped in their shaggy watch coats , and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters , all bedarned and ragged , and their beards stiff with icicles , they seemed an eruption of bears from labrador . they had just landed from their boat , and this was the first house they entered . no wonder , then , that they made a straight wake for the whale ’ s mouth—the bar—when the wrinkled little old jonah , there officiating , soon poured them out brimmers all round . one complained of a bad cold in his head , upon which jonah mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses , which he swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever , never mind of how long standing , or whether caught off the coast of labrador , or on the weather side of an ice-island .

melville	moby	“ yes , i may as well , ” said the surgeon , coolly . “ i was about observing , sir , before captain boomer ’ s facetious interruption , that spite of my best and severest endeavors , the wound kept getting worse and worse ; the truth was , sir , it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw ; more than two feet and several inches long . i measured it with the lead line . in short , it grew black ; i knew what was threatened , and off it came . but i had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there ; that thing is against all rule ” —pointing at it with the marlingspike— “ that is the captain ’ s work , not mine ; he ordered the carpenter to make it ; he had that club-hammer there put to the end , to knock some one ’ s brains out with , i suppose , as he tried mine once . he flies into diabolical passions sometimes . do ye see this dent , sir ” —removing his hat , and brushing aside his hair , and exposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull , but which bore not the slightest scarry trace , or any token of ever having been a wound— “ well , the captain there will tell you how that came here ; he knows . ”
melville	moby	chapter 3 . the spouter-inn . entering that gable-ended spouter-inn , you found yourself in a wide , low , straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots , reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft . on one side hung a very large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked , and every way defaced , that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it , it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it , and careful inquiry of the neighbors , that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its purpose . such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows , that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist , in the time of the new england hags , had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched . but by dint of much and earnest contemplation , and oft repeated ponderings , and especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry , you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea , however wild , might not be altogether unwarranted .
melville	moby	“ no , thank ye , bunger , ” said the english captain , “ he ’ s welcome to the arm he has , since i can ’ t help it , and didn ’ t know him then ; but not to another one . no more white whales for me ; i ’ ve lowered for him once , and that has satisfied me . there would be great glory in killing him , i know that ; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm in him , but , hark ye , he ’ s best let alone ; don ’ t you think so , captain ? ” —glancing at the ivory leg .

melville	moby	now , there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized ; that while a sick , civilized man may be six months convalescing , generally speaking , a sick savage is almost half-well again in a day . so , in good time my queequeg gained strength ; and at length after sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days ( but eating with a vigorous appetite ) he suddenly leaped to his feet , threw out his arms and legs , gave himself a good stretching , yawned a little bit , and then springing into the head of his hoisted boat , and poising a harpoon , pronounced himself fit for a fight .
melville	moby	“ and what will you do with the tail , stubb ? ” “ do with it ? sell it for an ox whip when we get home ; —what else ? ” “ now , do you mean what you say , and have been saying all along , stubb ? ”
melville	moby	the day was nearly done ; only the hem of his golden robe was rustling . soon , it was almost dark , but the look-out men still remained unset . “ can ’ t see the spout now , sir ; —too dark ” —cried a voice from the air .
melville	moby	upon this the captain started , and eagerly desired to know more . “ what now ? ” said the guernsey-man to stubb . “ why , since he takes it so easy , tell him that now i have eyed him carefully , i ’ m quite certain that he ’ s no more fit to command a whale-ship than a st. jago monkey . in fact , tell him from me he ’ s a baboon . ”
melville	moby	but ahab ’ s glance was averted ; like a blighted fruit tree he shook , and cast his last , cindered apple to the soil . “ what is it , what nameless , inscrutable , unearthly thing is it ; what cozening , hidden lord and master , and cruel , remorseless emperor commands me ; that against all natural lovings and longings , i so keep pushing , and crowding , and jamming myself on all the time ; recklessly making me ready to do what in my own proper , natural heart , i durst not so much as dare ? is ahab , ahab ? is it i , god , or who , that lifts this arm ? but if the great sun move not of himself ; but is as an errand-boy in heaven ; nor one single star can revolve , but by some invisible power ; how then can this one small heart beat ; this one small brain think thoughts ; unless god does that beating , does that thinking , does that living , and not i . by heaven , man , we are turned round and round in this world , like yonder windlass , and fate is the handspike . and all the time , lo ! that smiling sky , and this unsounded sea ! look ! see yon albicore ! who put it into him to chase and fang that flying-fish ? where do murderers go , man ! who ’ s to doom , when the judge himself is dragged to the bar ? but it is a mild , mild wind , and a mild looking sky ; and the air smells now , as if it blew from a far-away meadow ; they have been making hay somewhere under the slopes of the andes , starbuck , and the mowers are sleeping among the new-mown hay . sleeping ? aye , toil we how we may , we all sleep at last on the field . sleep ? aye , and rust amid greenness ; as last year ’ s scythes flung down , and left in the half-cut swaths—starbuck ! ”
melville	moby	the lower subdivided part , called the junk , is one immense honeycomb of oil , formed by the crossing and recrossing , into ten thousand infiltrated cells , of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole extent . the upper part , known as the case , may be regarded as the great heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale . and as that famous great tierce is mystically carved in front , so the whale ’ s vast plaited forehead forms innumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his wondrous tun . moreover , as that of heidelburgh was always replenished with the most excellent of the wines of the rhenish valleys , so the tun of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintages ; namely , the highly-prized spermaceti , in its absolutely pure , limpid , and odoriferous state . nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of the creature . though in life it remains perfectly fluid , yet , upon exposure to the air , after death , it soon begins to concrete ; sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots , as when the first thin delicate ice is just forming in water . a large whale ’ s case generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm , though from unavoidable circumstances , considerable of it is spilled , leaks , and dribbles away , or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of securing what you can .
melville	moby	in the sixth christian century lived procopius , a christian magistrate of constantinople , in the days when justinian was emperor and belisarius general . as many know , he wrote the history of his own times , a work every way of uncommon value . by the best authorities , he has always been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian , except in some one or two particulars , not at all affecting the matter presently to be mentioned .
melville	moby	but to learn all about these recondite matters , your best way is at once to descend into the blubber-room , and have a long talk with its inmates . this place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for the blanket-pieces , when stript and hoisted from the whale . when the proper time arrives for cutting up its contents , this apartment is a scene of terror to all tyros , especially by night . on one side , lit by a dull lantern , a space has been left clear for the workmen . they generally go in pairs , —a pike-and-gaffman and a spade-man . the whaling-pike is similar to a frigate ’ s boarding-weapon of the same name . the gaff is something like a boat-hook . with his gaff , the gaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber , and strives to hold it from slipping , as the ship pitches and lurches about . meanwhile , the spade-man stands on the sheet itself , perpendicularly chopping it into the portable horse-pieces . this spade is sharp as hone can make it ; the spademan ’ s feet are shoeless ; the thing he stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from him , like a sledge . if he cuts off one of his own toes , or one of his assistants ’ , would you be very much astonished ? toes are scarce among veteran blubber-room men .
melville	moby	“ poor rover ! will ye never have done with all this weary roving ? where go ye now ? but if the currents carry ye to those sweet antilles where the beaches are only beat with water-lilies , will ye do one little errand for me ? seek out one pip , who ’ s now been missing long : i think he ’ s in those far antilles . if ye find him , then comfort him ; for he must be very sad ; for look ! he ’ s left his tambourine behind ; —i found it . rig-a-dig , dig , dig ! now , queequeg , die ; and i ’ ll beat ye your dying march . ”
melville	moby	but again he leaned over towards the people , and bowing his head lowly , with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility , he spake these words : “ shipmates , god has laid but one hand upon you ; both his hands press upon me . i have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that jonah teaches to all sinners ; and therefore to ye , and still more to me , for i am a greater sinner than ye . and now how gladly would i come down from this mast-head and sit on the hatches there where you sit , and listen as you listen , while some one of you reads _me_ that other and more awful lesson which jonah teaches to _me_ , as a pilot of the living god . how being an anointed pilot-prophet , or speaker of true things , and bidden by the lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked nineveh , jonah , appalled at the hostility he should raise , fled from his mission , and sought to escape his duty and his god by taking ship at joppa . but god is everywhere ; tarshish he never reached . as we have seen , god came upon him in the whale , and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom , and with swift slantings tore him along ‘ into the midst of the seas , ’ where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down , and ‘ the weeds were wrapped about his head , ’ and all the watery world of woe bowled over him . yet even then beyond the reach of any plummet— ‘ out of the belly of hell ’ —when the whale grounded upon the ocean ’ s utmost bones , even then , god heard the engulphed , repenting prophet when he cried . then god spake unto the fish ; and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea , the whale came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun , and all the delights of air and earth ; and ‘ vomited out jonah upon the dry land ; ’ when the word of the lord came a second time ; and jonah , bruised and beaten—his ears , like two sea-shells , still multitudinously murmuring of the ocean—jonah did the almighty ’ s bidding . and what was that , shipmates ? to preach the truth to the face of falsehood ! that was it !
melville	moby	“ of the hearses ? have i not said , old man , that neither hearse nor coffin can be thine ? ” “ and who are hearsed that die on the sea ? ” “ but i said , old man , that ere thou couldst die on this voyage , two hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea ; the first not made by mortal hands ; and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in america . ”
melville	moby	think of that , ye loyal britons ! we whalemen supply your kings and queens with coronation stuff ! chapter 26 . knights and squires . the chief mate of the pequod was starbuck , a native of nantucket , and a quaker by descent . he was a long , earnest man , and though born on an icy coast , seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes , his flesh being hard as twice-baked biscuit . transported to the indies , his live blood would not spoil like bottled ale . he must have been born in some time of general drought and famine , or upon one of those fast days for which his state is famous . only some thirty arid summers had he seen ; those summers had dried up all his physical superfluousness . but this , his thinness , so to speak , seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties and cares , than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight . it was merely the condensation of the man . he was by no means ill-looking ; quite the contrary . his pure tight skin was an excellent fit ; and closely wrapped up in it , and embalmed with inner health and strength , like a revivified egyptian , this starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come , and to endure always , as now ; for be it polar snow or torrid sun , like a patent chronometer , his interior vitality was warranted to do well in all climates . looking into his eyes , you seemed to see there the yet lingering images of those thousand-fold perils he had calmly confronted through life . a staid , steadfast man , whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of action , and not a tame chapter of sounds . yet , for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude , there were certain qualities in him which at times affected , and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest . uncommonly conscientious for a seaman , and endued with a deep natural reverence , the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline him to superstition ; but to that sort of superstition , which in some organizations seems rather to spring , somehow , from intelligence than from ignorance . outward portents and inward presentiments were his . and if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul , much more did his far-away domestic memories of his young cape wife and child , tend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature , and open him still further to those latent influences which , in some honest-hearted men , restrain the gush of dare-devil daring , so often evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery . “ i will have no man in my boat , ” said starbuck , “ who is not afraid of a whale. ” by this , he seemed to mean , not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril , but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward .
melville	moby	but one thing , nevertheless , that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits was this : ashore , i had heard something of both captain peleg and his unaccountable old crony bildad ; how that they being the principal proprietors of the pequod , therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners , left nearly the whole management of the ship ’ s affairs to these two . and i did not know but what the stingy old bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands , especially as i now found him on board the pequod , quite at home there in the cabin , and reading his bible as if at his own fireside . now while peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack-knife , old bildad , to my no small surprise , considering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings ; bildad never heeded us , but went on mumbling to himself out of his book , “ _lay_ not up for yourselves treasures upon earth , where moth— ”
melville	moby	for an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate , and his fiery cheeks , you would have almost thought that he had really received the blaze of the levelled tube . but , mastering his emotion , he half calmly rose , and as he quitted the cabin , paused for an instant and said : “ thou hast outraged , not insulted me , sir ; but for that i ask thee not to beware of starbuck ; thou wouldst but laugh ; but let ahab beware of ahab ; beware of thyself , old man . ”
melville	moby	be it said , however , that the sperm whale is far less liable to this accident than any other species . where one of that sort go down , twenty right whales do . this difference in the species is no doubt imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the right whale ; his venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton ; from this incumbrance the sperm whale is wholly free . but there are instances where , after the lapse of many hours or several days , the sunken whale again rises , more buoyant than in life . but the reason of this is obvious . gases are generated in him ; he swells to a prodigious magnitude ; becomes a sort of animal balloon . a line-of-battle ship could hardly keep him under then . in the shore whaling , on soundings , among the bays of new zealand , when a right whale gives token of sinking , they fasten buoys to him , with plenty of rope ; so that when the body has gone down , they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again .
melville	moby	but as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the sunken head of the indian at the mainmast , leaving a few inches of the erect spar yet visible , together with long streaming yards of the flag , which calmly undulated , with ironical coincidings , over the destroying billows they almost touched ; —at that instant , a red arm and a hammer hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air , in the act of nailing the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar . a sky-hawk that tauntingly had followed the main-truck downwards from its natural home among the stars , pecking at the flag , and incommoding tashtego there ; this bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing between the hammer and the wood ; and simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill , the submerged savage beneath , in his death-gasp , kept his hammer frozen there ; and so the bird of heaven , with archangelic shrieks , and his imperial beak thrust upwards , and his whole captive form folded in the flag of ahab , went down with his ship , which , like satan , would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her , and helmeted herself with it .
melville	moby	“ my captain , you must have ere this perceived , respected sir ” —said the imperturbable godly-looking bunger , slightly bowing to ahab— “ is apt to be facetious at times ; he spins us many clever things of that sort . but i may as well say—en passant , as the french remark—that i myself—that is to say , jack bunger , late of the reverend clergy—am a strict total abstinence man ; i never drink— ”
melville	moby	but it so happened , that those boats , without seeing pip , suddenly spying whales close to them on one side , turned , and gave chase ; and stubb ’ s boat was now so far away , and he and all his crew so intent upon his fish , that pip ’ s ringed horizon began to expand around him miserably . by the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him ; but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot ; such , at least , they said he was . the sea had jeeringly kept his finite body up , but drowned the infinite of his soul . not drowned entirely , though . rather carried down alive to wondrous depths , where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes ; and the miser-merman , wisdom , revealed his hoarded heaps ; and among the joyous , heartless , ever-juvenile eternities , pip saw the multitudinous , god-omnipresent , coral insects , that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs . he saw god ’ s foot upon the treadle of the loom , and spoke it ; and therefore his shipmates called him mad . so man ’ s insanity is heaven ’ s sense ; and wandering from all mortal reason , man comes at last to that celestial thought , which , to reason , is absurd and frantic ; and weal or woe , feels then uncompromised , indifferent as his god .
melville	moby	“ are these thy mother carey ’ s chickens , perth ? they are always flying in thy wake ; birds of good omen , too , but not to all ; —look here , they burn ; but thou—thou liv ’ st among them without a scorch . ”
melville	moby	chapter 22 . merry christmas . at length , towards noon , upon the final dismissal of the ship ’ s riggers , and after the pequod had been hauled out from the wharf , and after the ever-thoughtful charity had come off in a whale-boat , with her last gift—a night-cap for stubb , the second mate , her brother-in-law , and a spare bible for the steward—after all this , the two captains , peleg and bildad , issued from the cabin , and turning to the chief mate , peleg said :
melville	moby	hurriedly turning , with averted face , he descended into his cabin , leaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter rejection of his so earnest suit . but starting from his enchantment , gardiner silently hurried to the side ; more fell than stepped into his boat , and returned to his ship .
melville	moby	now , in that japanese sea , the days in summer are as freshets of effulgences . that unblinkingly vivid japanese sun seems the blazing focus of the glassy ocean ’ s immeasurable burning-glass . the sky looks lacquered ; clouds there are none ; the horizon floats ; and this nakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of god ’ s throne . well that ahab ’ s quadrant was furnished with coloured glasses , through which to take sight of that solar fire . so , swinging his seated form to the roll of the ship , and with his astrological-looking instrument placed to his eye , he remained in that posture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun should gain its precise meridian . meantime while his whole attention was absorbed , the parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ship ’ s deck , and with face thrown up like ahab ’ s , was eyeing the same sun with him ; only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs , and his wild face was subdued to an earthly passionlessness . at length the desired observation was taken ; and with his pencil upon his ivory leg , ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant . then falling into a moment ’ s revery , he again looked up towards the sun and murmured to himself : “ thou sea-mark ! thou high and mighty pilot ! thou tellest me truly where i _am_—but canst thou cast the least hint where i _shall_ be ? or canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is this moment living ? where is moby dick ? this instant thou must be eyeing him . these eyes of mine look into the very eye that is even now beholding him ; aye , and into the eye that is even now equally beholding the objects on the unknown , thither side of thee , thou sun ! ”
melville	moby	a curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this visual matter as touching the leviathan . but i must be content with a hint . so long as a man ’ s eyes are open in the light , the act of seeing is involuntary ; that is , he can not then help mechanically seeing whatever objects are before him . nevertheless , any one ’ s experience will teach him , that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance , it is quite impossible for him , attentively , and completely , to examine any two things—however large or however small—at one and the same instant of time ; never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other . but if you now come to separate these two objects , and surround each by a circle of profound darkness ; then , in order to see one of them , in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it , the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness . how is it , then , with the whale ? true , both his eyes , in themselves , must simultaneously act ; but is his brain so much more comprehensive , combining , and subtle than man ’ s , that he can at the same moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects , one on one side of him , and the other in an exactly opposite direction ? if he can , then is it as marvellous a thing in him , as if a man were able simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct problems in euclid . nor , strictly investigated , is there any incongruity in this comparison .
melville	moby	“ ‘ come out of that , ye pirates ! ’ roared the captain , now menacing them with a pistol in each hand , just brought to him by the steward . ‘ come out of that , ye cut-throats ! ’
melville	moby	“ d ’ ye mark him , flask ? ” whispered stubb ; “ the chick that ’ s in him pecks the shell . ’ twill soon be out. ” the hours wore on ; —ahab now shut up within his cabin ; anon , pacing the deck , with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect .
melville	moby	“ sing , sir ? do i sing ? oh , i ’ m indifferent enough , sir , for that ; but the reason why the grave-digger made music must have been because there was none in his spade , sir . but the caulking mallet is full of it . hark to it . ”
melville	moby	in the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale , there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew . now hands are wanted here , and then again hands are wanted there . there is no staying in any one place ; for at one and the same time everything has to be done everywhere . it is much the same with him who endeavors the description of the scene . we must now retrace our way a little . it was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale ’ s back , the blubber-hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates . but how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole ? it was inserted there by my particular friend queequeg , whose duty it was , as harpooneer , to descend upon the monster ’ s back for the special purpose referred to . but in very many cases , circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is concluded . the whale , be it observed , lies almost entirely submerged , excepting the immediate parts operated upon . so down there , some ten feet below the level of the deck , the poor harpooneer flounders about , half on the whale and half in the water , as the vast mass revolves like a tread-mill beneath him . on the occasion in question , queequeg figured in the highland costume—a shirt and socks—in which to my eyes , at least , he appeared to uncommon advantage ; and no one had a better chance to observe him , as will presently be seen .
melville	moby	though , in overseeing the pursuit of this whale , captain ahab had evinced his customary activity , to call it so ; yet now that the creature was dead , some vague dissatisfaction , or impatience , or despair , seemed working in him ; as if the sight of that dead body reminded him that moby dick was yet to be slain ; and though a thousand other whales were brought to his ship , all that would not one jot advance his grand , monomaniac object . very soon you would have thought from the sound on the pequod ’ s decks , that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in the deep ; for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck , and thrust rattling out of the port-holes . but by those clanking links , the vast corpse itself , not the ship , is to be moored . tied by the head to the stern , and by the tail to the bows , the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel ’ s and seen through the darkness of the night , which obscured the spars and rigging aloft , the two—ship and whale , seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks , whereof one reclines while the other remains standing . *
melville	moby	“ and what thing soever besides cometh within the chaos of this monster ’ s mouth , be it beast , boat , or stone , down it goes all incontinently that foul great swallow of his , and perisheth in the bottomless gulf of his paunch. ” —_holland ’ s plutarch ’ s morals_ .
melville	moby	there was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches , and a still slighter shuffling of women ’ s shoes , and all was quiet again , and every eye on the preacher .
melville	moby	whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far distant scenes , i know not , but he now spoke of his native island ; and , eager to hear his history , i begged him to go on and tell it . he gladly complied . though at the time i but ill comprehended not a few of his words , yet subsequent disclosures , when i had become more familiar with his broken phraseology , now enable me to present the whole story such as it may prove in the mere skeleton i give .
melville	moby	i say this continual smoking must have been one cause , at least , of his peculiar disposition ; for every one knows that this earthly air , whether ashore or afloat , is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it ; and as in time of the cholera , some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to their mouths ; so , likewise , against all mortal tribulations , stubb ’ s tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of disinfecting agent .
melville	moby	“ it was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second day , when they were washing down the decks , that a stupid teneriffe man , drawing water in the main-chains , all at once shouted out , ‘ there she rolls ! there she rolls ! ’ jesu , what a whale ! it was moby dick .
melville	moby	iceland sailor . i don ’ t like your floor , maty ; it ’ s too springy to my taste . i ’ m used to ice-floors . i ’ m sorry to throw cold water on the subject ; but excuse me .
melville	moby	nevertheless , some there were , who even in the face of these things were ready to give chase to moby dick ; and a still greater number who , chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely , without the specific details of any certain calamity , and without superstitious accompaniments , were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if offered .
melville	moby	the harpoon was darted ; the stricken whale flew forward ; with igniting velocity the line ran through the grooves ; —ran foul . ahab stooped to clear it ; he did clear it ; but the flying turn caught him round the neck , and voicelessly as turkish mutes bowstring their victim , he was shot out of the boat , ere the crew knew he was gone . next instant , the heavy eye-splice in the rope ’ s final end flew out of the stark-empty tub , knocked down an oarsman , and smiting the sea , disappeared in its depths .
melville	moby	“ heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps , for all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate ; but somehow still smothering the conflagration within him , without speaking he remained doggedly rooted to his seat , till at last the incensed radney shook the hammer within a few inches of his face , furiously commanding him to do his bidding .
melville	moby	“ if you should write a fable for little fishes , you would make them speak like great whales. ” —_goldsmith to johnson_ . “ in the afternoon we saw what was supposed to be a rock , but it was found to be a dead whale , which some asiatics had killed , and were then towing ashore . they seemed to endeavor to conceal themselves behind the whale , in order to avoid being seen by us. ” —_cook ’ s voyages_ .
melville	moby	“ oh , my captain ! my captain ! noble soul ! grand old heart , after all ! why should any one give chase to that hated fish ! away with me ! let us fly these deadly waters ! let us home ! wife and child , too , are starbuck ’ s—wife and child of his brotherly , sisterly , play-fellow youth ; even as thine , sir , are the wife and child of thy loving , longing , paternal old age ! away ! let us away ! —this instant let me alter the course ! how cheerily , how hilariously , o my captain , would we bowl on our way to see old nantucket again ! i think , sir , they have some such mild blue days , even as this , in nantucket . ”
melville	moby	but at this question , queequeg , who had twice or thrice before taken part in similar ceremonies , looked no ways abashed ; but taking the offered pen , copied upon the paper , in the proper place , an exact counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm ; so that through captain peleg ’ s obstinate mistake touching his appellative , it stood something like this : —
melville	moby	physiognomically regarded , the sperm whale is an anomalous creature . he has no proper nose . and since the nose is the central and most conspicuous of the features ; and since it perhaps most modifies and finally controls their combined expression ; hence it would seem that its entire absence , as an external appendage , must very largely affect the countenance of the whale . for as in landscape gardening , a spire , cupola , monument , or tower of some sort , is deemed almost indispensable to the completion of the scene ; so no face can be physiognomically in keeping without the elevated open-work belfry of the nose . dash the nose from phidias ’ s marble jove , and what a sorry remainder ! nevertheless , leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude , all his proportions are so stately , that the same deficiency which in the sculptured jove were hideous , in him is no blemish at all . nay , it is an added grandeur . a nose to the whale would have been impertinent . as on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your jolly-boat , your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled . a pestilent conceit , which so often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest royal beadle on his throne .
melville	moby	“ clear away the boats ! luff ! ” cried ahab . and obeying his own order , he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes . the sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale ; and ere the boats were down , majestically turning , he swam away to the leeward , but with such a steady tranquillity , and making so few ripples as he swam , that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed , ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used , and no man must speak but in whispers . so seated like ontario indians on the gunwales of the boats , we swiftly but silently paddled along ; the calm not admitting of the noiseless sails being set . presently , as we thus glided in chase , the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air , and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up .
melville	moby	it is not , perhaps , entirely because the whale is so excessively unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence ; that appears to result , in some way , from the consideration before mentioned : _i.e._ that a man should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea , and eat it too by its own light . but no doubt the first man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer ; perhaps he was hung ; and if he had been put on his trial by oxen , he certainly would have been ; and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does . go to the meat-market of a saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds staring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds . does not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibal ’ s jaw ? cannibals ? who is not a cannibal ? i tell you it will be more tolerable for the fejee that salted down a lean missionary in his cellar against a coming famine ; it will be more tolerable for that provident fejee , i say , in the day of judgment , than for thee , civilized and enlightened gourmand , who nailest geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy paté-de-foie-gras .
melville	moby	know ye now , bulkington ? glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally intolerable truth ; that all deep , earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea ; while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous , slavish shore ?
melville	moby	but the only thing to be considered here , is this—what kind of oil is used at coronations ? certainly it can not be olive oil , nor macassar oil , nor castor oil , nor bear ’ s oil , nor train oil , nor cod-liver oil . what then can it possibly be , but sperm oil in its unmanufactured , unpolluted state , the sweetest of all oils ?
melville	moby	chapter 8 . the pulpit . i had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable robustness entered ; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon admitting him , a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation , sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain . yes , it was the famous father mapple , so called by the whalemen , among whom he was a very great favourite . he had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth , but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry . at the time i now write of , father mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age ; that sort of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth , for among all the fissures of his wrinkles , there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloom—the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath february ’ s snow . no one having previously heard his history , could for the first time behold father mapple without the utmost interest , because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him , imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led . when he entered i observed that he carried no umbrella , and certainly had not come in his carriage , for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet , and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed . however , hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed , and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner ; when , arrayed in a decent suit , he quietly approached the pulpit .
melville	moby	folding back the counterpane , i stooped over the bed . though none of the most elegant , it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well . i then glanced round the room ; and besides the bedstead and centre table , could see no other furniture belonging to the place , but a rude shelf , the four walls , and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale . of things not properly belonging to the room , there was a hammock lashed up , and thrown upon the floor in one corner ; also a large seaman ’ s bag , containing the harpooneer ’ s wardrobe , no doubt in lieu of a land trunk . likewise , there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the fire-place , and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed .
melville	moby	for a moment , the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would fain not use them . “ take them , man , i have no need for them ; for i now neither shave , sup , nor pray till—but here—to work ! ”
melville	moby	“ just after dark that day , when one watch had retired below , a clamor was heard in the forecastle ; and the two trembling traitors running up , besieged the cabin door , saying they durst not consort with the crew . entreaties , cuffs , and kicks could not drive them back , so at their own instance they were put down in the ship ’ s run for salvation . still , no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest . on the contrary , it seemed , that mainly at steelkilt ’ s instigation , they had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness , obey all orders to the last , and , when the ship reached port , desert her in a body . but in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage , they all agreed to another thing—namely , not to sing out for whales , in case any should be discovered . for , spite of her leak , and spite of all her other perils , the town-ho still maintained her mast-heads , and her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment , as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground ; and radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat , and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale .
melville	moby	good lord ! truly , sir , if it comes to that , i must calculate over again ; i think i didn ’ t carry a small figure , sir . look ye , pudding-heads should never grant premises.—how long before the leg is done ?
melville	moby	and the women of new bedford , they bloom like their own red roses . but roses only bloom in summer ; whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens . elsewhere match that bloom of theirs , ye can not , save in salem , where they tell me the young girls breathe such musk , their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off shore , as though they were drawing nigh the odorous moluccas instead of the puritanic sands .
melville	moby	a belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole : the carpenter claps it into one of his ever-ready vices , and straightway files it smaller . a lost land-bird of strange plumage strays on board , and is made a captive : out of clean shaved rods of right-whale bone , and cross-beams of sperm whale ivory , the carpenter makes a pagoda-looking cage for it . an oarsman sprains his wrist : the carpenter concocts a soothing lotion . stubb longed for vermillion stars to be painted upon the blade of his every oar ; screwing each oar in his big vice of wood , the carpenter symmetrically supplies the constellation . a sailor takes a fancy to wear shark-bone ear-rings : the carpenter drills his ears . another has the toothache : the carpenter out pincers , and clapping one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there ; but the poor fellow unmanageably winces under the unconcluded operation ; whirling round the handle of his wooden vice , the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in that , if he would have him draw the tooth .
melville	moby	but granting all this ; yet , regarded discreetly and coolly , seems it not but a mad idea , this ; that in the broad boundless ocean , one solitary whale , even if encountered , should be thought capable of individual recognition from his hunter , even as a white-bearded mufti in the thronged thoroughfares of constantinople ? yes . for the peculiar snow-white brow of moby dick , and his snow-white hump , could not but be unmistakable . and have i not tallied the whale , ahab would mutter to himself , as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he would throw himself back in reveries—tallied him , and shall he escape ? his broad fins are bored , and scalloped out like a lost sheep ’ s ear ! and here , his mad mind would run on in a breathless race ; till a weariness and faintness of pondering came over him ; and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover his strength . ah , god ! what trances of torments does that man endure who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire . he sleeps with clenched hands ; and wakes with his own bloody nails in his palms .
melville	moby	book ii . ( _octavo_ ) , chapter ii . ( _black fish_ ) .—i give the popular fishermen ’ s names for all these fish , for generally they are the best . where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive , i shall say so , and suggest another . i do so now , touching the black fish , so-called , because blackness is the rule among almost all whales . so , call him the hyena whale , if you please . his voracity is well known , and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards , he carries an everlasting mephistophelean grin on his face . this whale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length . he is found in almost all latitudes . he has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming , which looks something like a roman nose . when not more profitably employed , the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the hyena whale , to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment—as some frugal housekeepers , in the absence of company , and quite alone by themselves , burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax . though their blubber is very thin , some of these whales will yield you upwards of thirty gallons of oil .
melville	moby	now , this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed sperm whale is a very curious thing ; nor has any fisherman yet adequately accounted for it . usually the dead sperm whale floats with great buoyancy , with its side or belly considerably elevated above the surface . if the only whales that thus sank were old , meagre , and broken-hearted creatures , their pads of lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic ; then you might with some reason assert that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so sinking , consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him . but it is not so . for young whales , in the highest health , and swelling with noble aspirations , prematurely cut off in the warm flush and may of life , with all their panting lard about them ; even these brawny , buoyant heroes do sometimes sink .
melville	moby	but as in landlessness alone resides highest truth , shoreless , indefinite as god—so , better is it to perish in that howling infinite , than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee , even if that were safety ! for worm-like , then , oh ! who would craven crawl to land ! terrors of the terrible ! is all this agony so vain ? take heart , take heart , o bulkington ! bear thee grimly , demigod ! up from the spray of thy ocean-perishing—straight up , leaps thy apotheosis !
melville	moby	“ mr . starbuck ! larboard boat there , ahoy ! a word with ye , sir , if ye please ! ” “ halloa ! ” returned starbuck , turning round not a single inch as he spoke ; still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew ; his face set like a flint from stubb ’ s .
melville	moby	he gave the word ; and still gazing round him , was steadily lowered through the cloven blue air to the deck . in due time the boats were lowered ; but as standing in his shallop ’ s stern , ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent , he waved to the mate , —who held one of the tackle-ropes on deck—and bade him pause .
melville	moby	“ look ye now , young man , thy lungs are a sort of soft , d ’ ye see ; thou dost not talk shark a bit . _sure_ , ye ’ ve been to sea before now ; sure of that ? ”
melville	moby	but on the occasion in question , those dents looked deeper , even as his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark . and , so full of his thought was ahab , that at every uniform turn that he made , now at the main-mast and now at the binnacle , you could almost see that thought turn in him as he turned , and pace in him as he paced ; so completely possessing him , indeed , that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement .
melville	moby	furthermore : concerning these last mentioned leviathans , they have two firm fortresses , which , in all human probability , will for ever remain impregnable . and as upon the invasion of their valleys , the frosty swiss have retreated to their mountains ; so , hunted from the savannas and glades of the middle seas , the whale-bone whales can at last resort to their polar citadels , and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers and walls there , come up among icy fields and floes ; and in a charmed circle of everlasting december , bid defiance to all pursuit from man .
melville	moby	“ ‘ canallers ! ’ cried don pedro . ‘ we have seen many whale-ships in our harbours , but never heard of your canallers . pardon : who and what are they ? ’ “ ‘ canallers , don , are the boatmen belonging to our grand erie canal . you must have heard of it . ’
melville	moby	cutting me a green measuring-rod , i once more dived within the skeleton . from their arrow-slit in the skull , the priests perceived me taking the altitude of the final rib , “ how now ! ” they shouted ; “ dar ’ st thou measure this our god ! that ’ s for us. ” “ aye , priests—well , how long do ye make him , then ? ” but hereupon a fierce contest rose among them , concerning feet and inches ; they cracked each other ’ s sconces with their yard-sticks—the great skull echoed—and seizing that lucky chance , i quickly concluded my own admeasurements .
melville	moby	“ now , gentlemen , sweeping a ship ’ s deck at sea is a piece of household work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every evening ; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually foundering at the time . such , gentlemen , is the inflexibility of sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen ; some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing their faces . but in all vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys , if boys there be aboard . besides , it was the stronger men in the town-ho that had been divided into gangs , taking turns at the pumps ; and being the most athletic seaman of them all , steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs ; consequently he should have been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical duties , such being the case with his comrades . i mention all these particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men .
melville	moby	“ the lakeman now patrolled the barricade , all the while keeping his eye on the captain , and jerking out such sentences as these : — ‘ it ’ s not our fault ; we didn ’ t want it ; i told him to take his hammer away ; it was boy ’ s business ; he might have known me before this ; i told him not to prick the buffalo ; i believe i have broken a finger here against his cursed jaw ; ain ’ t those mincing knives down in the forecastle there , men ? look to those handspikes , my hearties . captain , by god , look to yourself ; say the word ; don ’ t be a fool ; forget it all ; we are ready to turn to ; treat us decently , and we ’ re your men ; but we won ’ t be flogged . ’
melville	moby	“ by art is created that great leviathan , called a commonwealth or state— ( in latin , civitas ) which is but an artificial man. ” —_opening sentence of hobbes ’ s leviathan_ . “ silly mansoul swallowed it without chewing , as if it had been a sprat in the mouth of a whale. ” —_pilgrim ’ s progress_ .
melville	moby	but though without dissent this point be fixed , how is mortal man to account for it ? to analyse it , would seem impossible . can we , then , by the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of whiteness—though for the time either wholly or in great part stripped of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful , but nevertheless , is found to exert over us the same sorcery , however modified ; —can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us to the hidden cause we seek ?
melville	moby	as ahab now glided from the dejected delight , the strange life-buoy hanging at the pequod ’ s stern came into conspicuous relief . “ ha ! yonder ! look yonder , men ! ” cried a foreboding voice in her wake . “ in vain , oh , ye strangers , ye fly our sad burial ; ye but turn us your taffrail to show us your coffin ! ”
melville	moby	in the english boats two tubs are used instead of one ; the same line being continuously coiled in both tubs . there is some advantage in this ; because these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into the boat , and do not strain it so much ; whereas , the american tub , nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth , makes a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half-inch in thickness ; for the bottom of the whale-boat is like critical ice , which will bear up a considerable distributed weight , but not very much of a concentrated one . when the painted canvas cover is clapped on the american line-tub , the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodigious great wedding-cake to present to the whales .
melville	moby	“ madman ! look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own. ” “ what ! how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else , never mind how foolish ? ” “ here ! ” cried starbuck , seizing stubb by the shoulder , and pointing his hand towards the weather bow , “ markest thou not that the gale comes from the eastward , the very course ahab is to run for moby dick ? the very course he swung to this day noon ? now mark his boat there ; where is that stove ? in the stern-sheets , man ; where he is wont to stand—his stand-point is stove , man ! now jump overboard , and sing away , if thou must !
melville	moby	supper over , the company went back to the bar-room , when , knowing not what else to do with myself , i resolved to spend the rest of the evening as a looker on .
melville	moby	chapter 103 . measurement of the whale ’ s skeleton . in the first place , i wish to lay before you a particular , plain statement , touching the living bulk of this leviathan , whose skeleton we are briefly to exhibit . such a statement may prove useful here .
melville	moby	but mark : aloft there , at the three mast heads , stand three men intent on spying out more whales , which , if caught , infallibly will again soil the old oaken furniture , and drop at least one small grease-spot somewhere . yes ; and many is the time , when , after the severest uninterrupted labors , which know no night ; continuing straight through for ninety-six hours ; when from the boat , where they have swelled their wrists with all day rowing on the line , —they only step to the deck to carry vast chains , and heave the heavy windlass , and cut and slash , yea , and in their very sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by the combined fires of the equatorial sun and the equatorial try-works ; when , on the heel of all this , they have finally bestirred themselves to cleanse the ship , and make a spotless dairy room of it ; many is the time the poor fellows , just buttoning the necks of their clean frocks , are startled by the cry of “ there she blows ! ” and away they fly to fight another whale , and go through the whole weary thing again . oh ! my friends , but this is man-killing ! yet this is life . for hardly have we mortals by long toilings extracted from this world ’ s vast bulk its small but valuable sperm ; and then , with weary patience , cleansed ourselves from its defilements , and learned to live here in clean tabernacles of the soul ; hardly is this done , when—_there she blows ! _—the ghost is spouted up , and away we sail to fight some other world , and go through young life ’ s old routine again .
melville	moby	ahab turned . “ starbuck ! ” “ sir. ” “ oh , starbuck ! it is a mild , mild wind , and a mild looking sky . on such a day—very much such a sweetness as this—i struck my first whale—a boy-harpooneer of eighteen ! forty—forty—forty years ago ! —ago ! forty years of continual whaling ! forty years of privation , and peril , and storm-time ! forty years on the pitiless sea ! for forty years has ahab forsaken the peaceful land , for forty years to make war on the horrors of the deep ! aye and yes , starbuck , out of those forty years i have not spent three ashore . when i think of this life i have led ; the desolation of solitude it has been ; the masoned , walled-town of a captain ’ s exclusiveness , which admits but small entrance to any sympathy from the green country without—oh , weariness ! heaviness ! guinea-coast slavery of solitary command ! —when i think of all this ; only half-suspected , not so keenly known to me before—and how for forty years i have fed upon dry salted fare—fit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soil ! —when the poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily hand , and broken the world ’ s fresh bread to my mouldy crusts—away , whole oceans away , from that young girl-wife i wedded past fifty , and sailed for cape horn the next day , leaving but one dent in my marriage pillow—wife ? wife ? —rather a widow with her husband alive ! aye , i widowed that poor girl when i married her , starbuck ; and then , the madness , the frenzy , the boiling blood and the smoking brow , with which , for a thousand lowerings old ahab has furiously , foamingly chased his prey—more a demon than a man ! —aye , aye ! what a forty years ’ fool—fool—old fool , has old ahab been ! why this strife of the chase ? why weary , and palsy the arm at the oar , and the iron , and the lance ? how the richer or better is ahab now ? behold . oh , starbuck ! is it not hard , that with this weary load i bear , one poor leg should have been snatched from under me ? here , brush this old hair aside ; it blinds me , that i seem to weep . locks so grey did never grow but from out some ashes ! but do i look very old , so very , very old , starbuck ? i feel deadly faint , bowed , and humped , as though i were adam , staggering beneath the piled centuries since paradise . god ! god ! god ! —crack my heart ! —stave my brain ! —mockery ! mockery ! bitter , biting mockery of grey hairs , have i lived enough joy to wear ye ; and seem and feel thus intolerably old ? close ! stand close to me , starbuck ; let me look into a human eye ; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky ; better than to gaze upon god . by the green land ; by the bright hearth-stone ! this is the magic glass , man ; i see my wife and my child in thine eye . no , no ; stay on board , on board ! —lower not when i do ; when branded ahab gives chase to moby dick . that hazard shall not be thine . no , no ! not with the far away home i see in that eye ! ”
melville	moby	“ captain ahab , ” said starbuck , who , with stubb and flask , had thus far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise , but at last seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder . “ captain ahab , i have heard of moby dick—but it was not moby dick that took off thy leg ? ”
melville	moby	but by her still halting course and winding , woeful way , you plainly saw that this ship that so wept with spray , still remained without comfort . she was rachel , weeping for her children , because they were not .
melville	moby	how different the loud little king-post . “ sing out and say something , my hearties . roar and pull , my thunderbolts ! beach me , beach me on their black backs , boys ; only do that for me , and i ’ ll sign over to you my martha ’ s vineyard plantation , boys ; including wife and children , boys . lay me on—lay me on ! o lord , lord ! but i shall go stark , staring mad ! see ! see that white water ! ” and so shouting , he pulled his hat from his head , and stamped up and down on it ; then picking it up , flirted it far off upon the sea ; and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the boat ’ s stern like a crazed colt from the prairie .
melville	moby	chapter 23 . the lee shore . some chapters back , one bulkington was spoken of , a tall , newlanded mariner , encountered in new bedford at the inn . when on that shivering winter ’ s night , the pequod thrust her vindictive bows into the cold malicious waves , who should i see standing at her helm but bulkington ! i looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the man , who in mid-winter just landed from a four years ’ dangerous voyage , could so unrestingly push off again for still another tempestuous term . the land seemed scorching to his feet . wonderfullest things are ever the unmentionable ; deep memories yield no epitaphs ; this six-inch chapter is the stoneless grave of bulkington . let me only say that it fared with him as with the storm-tossed ship , that miserably drives along the leeward land . the port would fain give succor ; the port is pitiful ; in the port is safety , comfort , hearthstone , supper , warm blankets , friends , all that ’ s kind to our mortalities . but in that gale , the port , the land , is that ship ’ s direst jeopardy ; she must fly all hospitality ; one touch of land , though it but graze the keel , would make her shudder through and through . with all her might she crowds all sail off shore ; in so doing , fights ’ gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward ; seeks all the lashed sea ’ s landlessness again ; for refuge ’ s sake forlornly rushing into peril ; her only friend her bitterest foe !
melville	moby	but blanched to a corpse ’ s hue with despair , the mate had stolen away . ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side ; but started at two reflected , fixed eyes in the water there . fedallah was motionlessly leaning over the same rail .
melville	moby	however , a good laugh is a mighty good thing , and rather too scarce a good thing ; the more ’ s the pity . so , if any one man , in his own proper person , afford stuff for a good joke to anybody , let him not be backward , but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way . and the man that has anything bountifully laughable about him , be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for .
melville	moby	“ my boy , ” said the landlord , “ you ’ ll have the nightmare to a dead sartainty. ” “ landlord , ” i whispered , “ that aint the harpooneer is it ? ” “ oh , no , ” said he , looking a sort of diabolically funny , “ the harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap . he never eats dumplings , he don ’ t—he eats nothing but steaks , and he likes ’ em rare . ”
melville	moby	“ on this level , ahab ’ s hammock swings within ; his head this way . a touch , and starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again.—oh mary ! mary ! —boy ! boy ! boy ! —but if i wake thee not to death , old man , who can tell to what unsounded deeps starbuck ’ s body this day week may sink , with all the crew ! great god , where art thou ? shall i ? shall i ? —the wind has gone down and shifted , sir ; the fore and main topsails are reefed and set ; she heads her course . ”
melville	moby	the forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools . like a mob of young collegians , they are full of fight , fun , and wickedness , tumbling round the world at such a reckless , rollicking rate , that no prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous lad at yale or harvard . they soon relinquish this turbulence though , and when about three-fourths grown , break up , and separately go about in quest of settlements , that is , harems .
melville	moby	fashioned at last into an arrowy shape , and welded by perth to the shank , the steel soon pointed the end of the iron ; and as the blacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat , prior to tempering them , he cried to ahab to place the water-cask near .
melville	moby	when first severed , the head is dropped astern and held there by a cable till the body is stripped . that done , if it belong to a small whale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of . but , with a full grown leviathan this is impossible ; for the sperm whale ’ s head embraces nearly one third of his entire bulk , and completely to suspend such a burden as that , even by the immense tackles of a whaler , this were as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a dutch barn in jewellers ’ scales .
melville	moby	“ mrs . hussey , ” said i , “ he ’ s _alive_ at all events ; so leave us , if you please , and i will see to this strange affair myself. ” closing the door upon the landlady , i endeavored to prevail upon queequeg to take a chair ; but in vain . there he sat ; and all he could do—for all my polite arts and blandishments—he would not move a peg , nor say a single word , nor even look at me , nor notice my presence in the slightest way .
melville	moby	but his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild . “ kee-hee ! kee-hee ! ” yelled daggoo , straining forwards and backwards on his seat , like a pacing tiger in his cage . “ ka-la ! koo-loo ! ” howled queequeg , as if smacking his lips over a mouthful of grenadier ’ s steak . and thus with oars and yells the keels cut the sea . meanwhile , stubb retaining his place in the van , still encouraged his men to the onset , all the while puffing the smoke from his mouth . like desperadoes they tugged and they strained , till the welcome cry was heard— “ stand up , tashtego ! —give it to him ! ” the harpoon was hurled . “ stern all ! ” the oarsmen backed water ; the same moment something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists . it was the magical line . an instant before , stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it round the loggerhead , whence , by reason of its increased rapid circlings , a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes from his pipe . as the line passed round and round the loggerhead ; so also , just before reaching that point , it blisteringly passed through and through both of stubb ’ s hands , from which the hand-cloths , or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at these times , had accidentally dropped . it was like holding an enemy ’ s sharp two-edged sword by the blade , and that enemy all the time striving to wrest it out of your clutch .
melville	moby	steering as she had done , the wind had been somewhat on the pequod ’ s quarter , so that now being pointed in the reverse direction , the braced ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own white wake .
melville	moby	but we are all in the hands of the gods ; and pip jumped again . it was under very similar circumstances to the first performance ; but this time he did not breast out the line ; and hence , when the whale started to run , pip was left behind on the sea , like a hurried traveller ’ s trunk . alas ! stubb was but too true to his word . it was a beautiful , bounteous , blue day ; the spangled sea calm and cool , and flatly stretching away , all round , to the horizon , like gold-beater ’ s skin hammered out to the extremest . bobbing up and down in that sea , pip ’ s ebon head showed like a head of cloves . no boat-knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern . stubb ’ s inexorable back was turned upon him ; and the whale was winged . in three minutes , a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between pip and stubb . out from the centre of the sea , poor pip turned his crisp , curling , black head to the sun , another lonely castaway , though the loftiest and the brightest .
melville	moby	death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this ; but death is only a launching into the region of the strange untried ; it is but the first salutation to the possibilities of the immense remote , the wild , the watery , the unshored ; therefore , to the death-longing eyes of such men , who still have left in them some interior compunctions against suicide , does the all-contributed and all-receptive ocean alluringly spread forth his whole plain of unimaginable , taking terrors , and wonderful , new-life adventures ; and from the hearts of infinite pacifics , the thousand mermaids sing to them— “ come hither , broken-hearted ; here is another life without the guilt of intermediate death ; here are wonders supernatural , without dying for them . come hither ! bury thyself in a life which , to your now equally abhorred and abhorring , landed world , is more oblivious than death . come hither ! put up _thy_ gravestone , too , within the churchyard , and come hither , till we marry thee ! ”
melville	moby	now , in this history of his , procopius mentions that , during the term of his prefecture at constantinople , a great sea-monster was captured in the neighboring propontis , or sea of marmora , after having destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years . a fact thus set down in substantial history can not easily be gainsaid . nor is there any reason it should be . of what precise species this sea-monster was , is not mentioned . but as he destroyed ships , as well as for other reasons , he must have been a whale ; and i am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale . and i will tell you why . for a long time i fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it . even now i am certain that those seas are not , and perhaps never can be , in the present constitution of things , a place for his habitual gregarious resort . but further investigations have recently proved to me , that in modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the mediterranean . i am told , on good authority , that on the barbary coast , a commodore davis of the british navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale . now , as a vessel of war readily passes through the dardanelles , hence a sperm whale could , by the same route , pass out of the mediterranean into the propontis .
melville	moby	with a long , weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board , as if it were an anchor ; and when the proper time comes—some few days after the other work—queequeg , daggoo , and tashtego , being all accomplished dentists , are set to drawing teeth . with a keen cutting-spade , queequeg lances the gums ; then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts , and a tackle being rigged from aloft , they drag out these teeth , as michigan oxen drag stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands . there are generally forty-two teeth in all ; in old whales , much worn down , but undecayed ; nor filled after our artificial fashion . the jaw is afterwards sawn into slabs , and piled away like joists for building houses .
melville	moby	oh , sir , it will break bones—beware , beware ! no fear ; i like a good grip ; i like to feel something in this slippery world that can hold , man . what ’ s prometheus about there ? —the blacksmith , i mean—what ’ s he about ?
melville	moby	but how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things ! of erections , how few are domed like st. peter ’ s ! of creatures , how few vast as the whale ! chapter 69 . the funeral .

melville	moby	though completely swamped , the boat was nearly unharmed . swimming round it we picked up the floating oars , and lashing them across the gunwale , tumbled back to our places . there we sat up to our knees in the sea , the water covering every rib and plank , so that to our downward gazing eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom of the ocean .

melville	moby	but these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very surprising after all . consider ! most of the scientific drawings have been taken from the stranded fish ; and these are about as correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship , with broken back , would correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars . though elephants have stood for their full-lengths , the living leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait . the living whale , in his full majesty and significance , is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters ; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight , like a launched line-of-battle ship ; and out of that element it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air , so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations . and , not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking whale and a full-grown platonian leviathan ; yet , even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship ’ s deck , such is then the outlandish , eel-like , limbered , varying shape of him , that his precise expression the devil himself could not catch .
melville	moby	nor , in some things , does the common , hereditary experience of all mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue . it can not well be doubted , that the one visible quality in the aspect of the dead which most appals the gazer , is the marble pallor lingering there ; as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of consternation in the other world , as of mortal trepidation here . and from that pallor of the dead , we borrow the expressive hue of the shroud in which we wrap them . nor even in our superstitions do we fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms ; all ghosts rising in a milk-white fog—yea , while these terrors seize us , let us add , that even the king of terrors , when personified by the evangelist , rides on his pallid horse .
melville	moby	ahab and all his boat ’ s crew seemed asleep but the parsee ; who crouching in the bow , sat watching the sharks , that spectrally played round the whale , and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails . a sound like the moaning in squadrons over asphaltites of unforgiven ghosts of gomorrah , ran shuddering through the air .
melville	moby	“ _my_ line ! _my_ line ? gone ? —gone ? what means that little word ? —what death-knell rings in it , that old ahab shakes as if he were the belfry . the harpoon , too ! —toss over the litter there , —d ’ ye see it ? —the forged iron , men , the white whale ’ s—no , no , no , —blistered fool ! this hand did dart it ! — ’ tis in the fish ! —aloft there ! keep him nailed—quick ! —all hands to the rigging of the boats—collect the oars—harpooneers ! the irons , the irons ! —hoist the royals higher—a pull on all the sheets ! —helm there ! steady , steady for your life ! i ’ ll ten times girdle the unmeasured globe ; yea and dive straight through it , but i ’ ll slay him yet ! ”

melville	moby	“ but there was more than this : the order about the shovel was almost as plainly meant to sting and insult steelkilt , as though radney had spat in his face . any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will understand this ; and all this and doubtless much more , the lakeman fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command . but as he sat still for a moment , and as he steadfastly looked into the mate ’ s malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him and the slow-match silently burning along towards them ; as he instinctively saw all this , that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful being—a repugnance most felt , when felt at all , by really valiant men even when aggrieved—this nameless phantom feeling , gentlemen , stole over steelkilt .
melville	moby	the life-buoy—a long slender cask—was dropped from the stern , where it always hung obedient to a cunning spring ; but no hand rose to seize it , and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken , so that it slowly filled , and that parched wood also filled at its every pore ; and the studded iron-bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom , as if to yield him his pillow , though in sooth but a hard one .

melville	moby	“ and a very vile one . when that wicked king was slain , the dogs , did they not lick his blood ? ” “ come hither to me—hither , hither , ” said peleg , with a significance in his eye that almost startled me . “ look ye , lad ; never say that on board the pequod . never say it anywhere . captain ahab did not name himself . ’ twas a foolish , ignorant whim of his crazy , widowed mother , who died when he was only a twelvemonth old . and yet the old squaw tistig , at gayhead , said that the name would somehow prove prophetic . and , perhaps , other fools like her may tell thee the same . i wish to warn thee . it ’ s a lie . i know captain ahab well ; i ’ ve sailed with him as mate years ago ; i know what he is—a good man—not a pious , good man , like bildad , but a swearing good man—something like me—only there ’ s a good deal more of him . aye , aye , i know that he was never very jolly ; and i know that on the passage home , he was a little out of his mind for a spell ; but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about , as any one might see . i know , too , that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale , he ’ s been a kind of moody—desperate moody , and savage sometimes ; but that will all pass off . and once for all , let me tell thee and assure thee , young man , it ’ s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one . so good-bye to thee—and wrong not captain ahab , because he happens to have a wicked name . besides , my boy , he has a wife—not three voyages wedded—a sweet , resigned girl . think of that ; by that sweet girl that old man has a child : hold ye then there can be any utter , hopeless harm in ahab ? no , no , my lad ; stricken , blasted , if he be , ahab has his humanities ! ”
melville	moby	book i . ( _folio_ ) , chapter iii . ( _fin-back_ ) .—under this head i reckon a monster which , by the various names of fin-back , tall-spout , and long-john , has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the atlantic , in the new york packet-tracks . in the length he attains , and in his baleen , the fin-back resembles the right whale , but is of a less portly girth , and a lighter colour , approaching to olive . his great lips present a cable-like aspect , formed by the intertwisting , slanting folds of large wrinkles . his grand distinguishing feature , the fin , from which he derives his name , is often a conspicuous object . this fin is some three or four feet long , growing vertically from the hinder part of the back , of an angular shape , and with a very sharp pointed end . even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible , this isolated fin will , at times , be seen plainly projecting from the surface . when the sea is moderately calm , and slightly marked with spherical ripples , and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface , it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial , with its style and wavy hour-lines graved on it . on that ahaz-dial the shadow often goes back . the fin-back is not gregarious . he seems a whale-hater , as some men are man-haters . very shy ; always going solitary ; unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters ; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain ; gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in swimming , as to defy all present pursuit from man ; this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable cain of his race , bearing for his mark that style upon his back . from having the baleen in his mouth , the fin-back is sometimes included with the right whale , among a theoretic species denominated _whalebone whales_ , that is , whales with baleen . of these so called whalebone whales , there would seem to be several varieties , most of which , however , are little known . broad-nosed whales and beaked whales ; pike-headed whales ; bunched whales ; under-jawed whales and rostrated whales , are the fishermen ’ s names for a few sorts .

melville	moby	no , when i go to sea , i go as a simple sailor , right before the mast , plumb down into the forecastle , aloft there to the royal mast-head . true , they rather order me about some , and make me jump from spar to spar , like a grasshopper in a may meadow . and at first , this sort of thing is unpleasant enough . it touches one ’ s sense of honor , particularly if you come of an old established family in the land , the van rensselaers , or randolphs , or hardicanutes . and more than all , if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot , you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster , making the tallest boys stand in awe of you . the transition is a keen one , i assure you , from a schoolmaster to a sailor , and requires a strong decoction of seneca and the stoics to enable you to grin and bear it . but even this wears off in time .
melville	moby	the quantity of beer , too , is very large , 10,800 barrels . now , as those polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that climate , so that the whole cruise of one of these dutch whalemen , including the short voyage to and from the spitzbergen sea , did not much exceed three months , say , and reckoning 30 men to each of their fleet of 180 sail , we have 5,400 low dutch seamen in all ; therefore , i say , we have precisely two barrels of beer per man , for a twelve weeks ’ allowance , exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin . now , whether these gin and beer harpooneers , so fuddled as one might fancy them to have been , were the right sort of men to stand up in a boat ’ s head , and take good aim at flying whales ; this would seem somewhat improbable . yet they did aim at them , and hit them too . but this was very far north , be it remembered , where beer agrees well with the constitution ; upon the equator , in our southern fishery , beer would be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast-head and boozy in his boat ; and grievous loss might ensue to nantucket and new bedford .
melville	moby	but , at last , he turned to his comrade , with a final sort of look about him , — “ captain bildad—come , old shipmate , we must go . back the main-yard there ! boat ahoy ! stand by to come close alongside , now ! careful , careful ! —come , bildad , boy—say your last . luck to ye , starbuck—luck to ye , mr. stubb—luck to ye , mr. flask—good-bye and good luck to ye all—and this day three years i ’ ll have a hot supper smoking for ye in old nantucket . hurrah and away ! ”

melville	moby	in this foreshadowing interval too , all humor , forced or natural , vanished . stubb no more strove to raise a smile ; starbuck no more strove to check one . alike , joy and sorrow , hope and fear , seemed ground to finest dust , and powdered , for the time , in the clamped mortar of ahab ’ s iron soul . like machines , they dumbly moved about the deck , ever conscious that the old man ’ s despot eye was on them .
melville	moby	i protested my innocence of these things . i saw that under the mask of these half humorous innuendoes , this old seaman , as an insulated quakerish nantucketer , was full of his insular prejudices , and rather distrustful of all aliens , unless they hailed from cape cod or the vineyard .

melville	moby	“ what ’ s that about cods , ma ’ am ? ” said i , with much politeness . “ clam or cod ? ” she repeated . “ a clam for supper ? a cold clam ; is _that_ what you mean , mrs. hussey ? ” says i , “ but that ’ s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time , ain ’ t it , mrs. hussey ? ”
melville	moby	“ tish ! the bucket ! ” chapter 44 . the chart . had you followed captain ahab down into his cabin after the squall that took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose with his crew , you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom , and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts , spread them before him on his screwed-down table . then seating himself before it , you would have seen him intently study the various lines and shadings which there met his eye ; and with slow but steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank . at intervals , he would refer to piles of old log-books beside him , wherein were set down the seasons and places in which , on various former voyages of various ships , sperm whales had been captured or seen .
melville	moby	“ aye. ” “ and shall i then pay over the same with pitch , sir ? ” moving his hand as with a pitch-pot . “ away ! what possesses thee to this ? make a life-buoy of the coffin , and no more.—mr . stubb , mr. flask , come forward with me . ”
melville	moby	two enormous wooden pots painted black , and suspended by asses ’ ears , swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast , planted in front of an old doorway . the horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other side , so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows . perhaps i was over sensitive to such impressions at the time , but i could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving . a sort of crick was in my neck as i gazed up to the two remaining horns ; yes , _two_ of them , one for queequeg , and one for me . it ’ s ominous , thinks i . a coffin my innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port ; tombstones staring at me in the whalemen ’ s chapel ; and here a gallows ! and a pair of prodigious black pots too ! are these last throwing out oblique hints touching tophet ?
melville	moby	at one extremity the rope was unstranded , and the separate spread yarns were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon ; the pole was then driven hard up into the socket ; from the lower end the rope was traced half-way along the pole ’ s length , and firmly secured so , with intertwistings of twine . this done , pole , iron , and rope—like the three fates—remained inseparable , and ahab moodily stalked away with the weapon ; the sound of his ivory leg , and the sound of the hickory pole , both hollowly ringing along every plank . but ere he entered his cabin , light , unnatural , half-bantering , yet most piteous sound was heard . oh , pip ! thy wretched laugh , thy idle but unresting eye ; all thy strange mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy ship , and mocked it !
melville	moby	and as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary times thrown its shadow before it ; we find some book naturalists—olassen and povelson—declaring the sperm whale not only to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea , but also to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood . nor even down to so late a time as cuvier ’ s , were these or almost similar impressions effaced . for in his natural history , the baron himself affirms that at sight of the sperm whale , all fish ( sharks included ) are “ struck with the most lively terrors , ” and “ often in the precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks with such violence as to cause instantaneous death. ” and however the general experiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these ; yet in their full terribleness , even to the bloodthirsty item of povelson , the superstitious belief in them is , in some vicissitudes of their vocation , revived in the minds of the hunters .
melville	moby	“ not far from the sea-side , they have a temple , the rafters and beams of which are made of whale-bones ; for whales of a monstrous size are oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore . the common people imagine , that by a secret power bestowed by god upon the temple , no whale can pass it without immediate death . but the truth of the matter is , that on either side of the temple , there are rocks that shoot two miles into the sea , and wound the whales when they light upon ’ em . they keep a whale ’ s rib of an incredible length for a miracle , which lying upon the ground with its convex part uppermost , makes an arch , the head of which can not be reached by a man upon a camel ’ s back . this rib ( says john leo ) is said to have layn there a hundred years before i saw it . their historians affirm , that a prophet who prophesy ’ d of mahomet , came from this temple , and some do not stand to assert , that the prophet jonas was cast forth by the whale at the base of the temple . ”

melville	moby	“ drink and pass ! ” he cried , handing the heavy charged flagon to the nearest seaman . “ the crew alone now drink . round with it , round ! short draughts—long swallows , men ; ’ tis hot as satan ’ s hoof . so , so ; it goes round excellently . it spiralizes in ye ; forks out at the serpent-snapping eye . well done ; almost drained . that way it went , this way it comes . hand it me—here ’ s a hollow ! men , ye seem the years ; so brimming life is gulped and gone . steward , refill !
melville	moby	chapter 53 . the gam . the ostensible reason why ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had spoken was this : the wind and sea betokened storms . but even had this not been the case , he would not after all , perhaps , have boarded her—judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions—if so it had been that , by the process of hailing , he had obtained a negative answer to the question he put . for , as it eventually turned out , he cared not to consort , even for five minutes , with any stranger captain , except he could contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought . but all this might remain inadequately estimated , were not something said here of the peculiar usages of whaling-vessels when meeting each other in foreign seas , and especially on a common cruising-ground .
melville	moby	and running up after me , she caught me as i was again trying to force open the door . “ i don ’ t allow it ; i won ’ t have my premises spoiled . go for the locksmith , there ’ s one about a mile from here . but avast ! ” putting her hand in her side-pocket , “ here ’ s a key that ’ ll fit , i guess ; let ’ s see. ” and with that , she turned it in the lock ; but , alas ! queequeg ’ s supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within .

melville	moby	“ scarcely had we proceeded two days on the sea , when about sunrise a great many whales and other monsters of the sea , appeared . among the former , one was of a most monstrous size .... this came towards us , open-mouthed , raising the waves on all sides , and beating the sea before him into a foam. ” —_tooke ’ s lucian_ . “ _the true history_ . ”
melville	moby	so assured , indeed , is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the sperm whale ’ s resorting to given waters , that many hunters believe that , could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world ; were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated , then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to correspond in invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the flights of swallows . on this hint , attempts have been made to construct elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale . *
melville	moby	the skeleton dimensions i shall now proceed to set down are copied verbatim from my right arm , where i had them tattooed ; as in my wild wanderings at that period , there was no other secure way of preserving such valuable statistics . but as i was crowded for space , and wished the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem i was then composing—at least , what untattooed parts might remain—i did not trouble myself with the odd inches ; nor , indeed , should inches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale .
melville	moby	“ there go flukes ! ” was now the cry from tashtego ; and the whales disappeared . “ quick , steward ! ” cried ahab . “ time ! time ! ” dough-boy hurried below , glanced at the watch , and reported the exact minute to ahab .
melville	moby	“ bless my soul , and curse the foul fiend ’ s , ” cried bunger , stoopingly walking round ahab , and like a dog , strangely snuffing ; “ this man ’ s blood—bring the thermometer ! —it ’ s at the boiling point ! —his pulse makes these planks beat ! —sir ! ” —taking a lancet from his pocket , and drawing near to ahab ’ s arm .
melville	moby	what wonder , then , that these nantucketers , born on a beach , should take to the sea for a livelihood ! they first caught crabs and quohogs in the sand ; grown bolder , they waded out with nets for mackerel ; more experienced , they pushed off in boats and captured cod ; and at last , launching a navy of great ships on the sea , explored this watery world ; put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it ; peeped in at behring ’ s straits ; and in all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the flood ; most monstrous and most mountainous ! that himmalehan , salt-sea mastodon , clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power , that his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaults !
melville	moby	hither , and thither , on high , glided the snow-white wings of small , unspeckled birds ; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air ; but to and fro in the deeps , far down in the bottomless blue , rushed mighty leviathans , sword-fish , and sharks ; and these were the strong , troubled , murderous thinkings of the masculine sea .
melville	moby	“ how heading when last seen ? ” “ as before , sir , —straight to leeward. ” “ good ! he will travel slower now ’ tis night . down royals and top-gallant stun-sails , mr. starbuck . we must not run over him before morning ; he ’ s making a passage now , and may heave-to a while . helm there ! keep her full before the wind ! —aloft ! come down ! —mr . stubb , send a fresh hand to the fore-mast head , and see it manned till morning. ” —then advancing towards the doubloon in the main-mast— “ men , this gold is mine , for i earned it ; but i shall let it abide here till the white whale is dead ; and then , whosoever of ye first raises him , upon the day he shall be killed , this gold is that man ’ s ; and if on that day i shall again raise him , then , ten times its sum shall be divided among all of ye ! away now ! —the deck is thine , sir ! ”
melville	moby	this ended , in prolonged solemn tones , like the continual tolling of a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog—in such tones he commenced reading the following hymn ; but changing his manner towards the concluding stanzas , burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy—
melville	moby	these admeasurements i now propose to set before you . but first , be it recorded , that , in this matter , i am not free to utter any fancied measurement i please . because there are skeleton authorities you can refer to , to test my accuracy . there is a leviathanic museum , they tell me , in hull , england , one of the whaling ports of that country , where they have some fine specimens of fin-backs and other whales . likewise , i have heard that in the museum of manchester , in new hampshire , they have what the proprietors call “ the only perfect specimen of a greenland or river whale in the united states. ” moreover , at a place in yorkshire , england , burton constable by name , a certain sir clifford constable has in his possession the skeleton of a sperm whale , but of moderate size , by no means of the full-grown magnitude of my friend king tranquo ’ s .
melville	moby	“ now , ” said queequeg , quietly hauling in the line , “ spos-ee him whale-e eye ; why , dad whale dead. ” “ quick , bildad , ” said peleg , his partner , who , aghast at the close vicinity of the flying harpoon , had retreated towards the cabin gangway . “ quick , i say , you bildad , and get the ship ’ s papers . we must have hedgehog there , i mean quohog , in one of our boats . look ye , quohog , we ’ ll give ye the ninetieth lay , and that ’ s more than ever was given a harpooneer yet out of nantucket . ”
melville	moby	starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly scornful old man , stubb was speechless a moment ; then said excitedly , “ i am not used to be spoken to that way , sir ; i do but less than half like it , sir . ”
melville	moby	and when that functionary appeared before him , he bade him without delay set about making a new leg , and directed the mates to see him supplied with all the studs and joists of jaw-ivory ( sperm whale ) which had thus far been accumulated on the voyage , in order that a careful selection of the stoutest , clearest-grained stuff might be secured . this done , the carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that night ; and to provide all the fittings for it , independent of those pertaining to the distrusted one in use . moreover , the ship ’ s forge was ordered to be hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold ; and , to accelerate the affair , the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the forging of whatever iron contrivances might be needed .
melville	moby	“ bring it up ; there ’ s nothing else for it , ” said starbuck , after a melancholy pause . “ rig it , carpenter ; do not look at me so—the coffin , i mean . dost thou hear me ? rig it . ”
melville	moby	i told him that i never liked to sleep two in a bed ; that if i should ever do so , it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be , and that if he ( the landlord ) really had no other place for me , and the harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable , why rather than wander further about a strange town on so bitter a night , i would put up with the half of any decent man ’ s blanket .

( _a small sized one_ . )
melville	moby	these reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after we were all seated at the table , and i was preparing to hear some good stories about whaling ; to my no small surprise , nearly every man maintained a profound silence . and not only that , but they looked embarrassed . yes , here were a set of sea-dogs , many of whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas—entire strangers to them—and duelled them dead without winking ; and yet , here they sat at a social breakfast table—all of the same calling , all of kindred tastes—looking round as sheepishly at each other as though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the green mountains . a curious sight ; these bashful bears , these timid warrior whalemen !
melville	moby	“ oh ! ahab , ” cried starbuck , “ not too late is it , even now , the third day , to desist . see ! moby dick seeks thee not . it is thou , thou , that madly seekest him ! ”
melville	moby	whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected with the sight of this object , certain it is , that a glimpse of it being so very unusual , that circumstance has gone far to invest it with portentousness . so rarely is it beheld , that though one and all of them declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean , yet very few of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature and form ; notwithstanding , they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale his only food . for though other species of whales find their food above water , and may be seen by man in the act of feeding , the spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the surface ; and only by inference is it that any one can tell of what , precisely , that food consists . at times , when closely pursued , he will disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid ; some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length . they fancy that the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean ; and that the sperm whale , unlike other species , is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it .
melville	moby	“ what think ye of those yellow boys , sir ! ” “ smuggled on board , somehow , before the ship sailed . ( strong , strong , boys ! ) ” in a whisper to his crew , then speaking out loud again : “ a sad business , mr. stubb ! ( seethe her , seethe her , my lads ! ) but never mind , mr. stubb , all for the best . let all your crew pull strong , come what will . ( spring , my men , spring ! ) there ’ s hogsheads of sperm ahead , mr. stubb , and that ’ s what ye came for . ( pull , my boys ! ) sperm , sperm ’ s the play ! this at least is duty ; duty and profit hand in hand . ”
melville	moby	i considered the matter a moment , and then up stairs we went , and i was ushered into a small room , cold as a clam , and furnished , sure enough , with a prodigious bed , almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to sleep abreast .
melville	moby	in the second engraving , the boat is in the act of drawing alongside the barnacled flank of a large running right whale , that rolls his black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the patagonian cliffs . his jets are erect , full , and black like soot ; so that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney , you would think there must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below . sea fowls are pecking at the small crabs , shell-fish , and other sea candies and maccaroni , which the right whale sometimes carries on his pestilent back . and all the while the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through the deep , leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake , and causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer . thus , the foreground is all raging commotion ; but behind , in admirable artistic contrast , is the glassy level of a sea becalmed , the drooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship , and the inert mass of a dead whale , a conquered fortress , with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whale-pole inserted into his spout-hole .
melville	moby	“ devils ! dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of me ? —on deck ! ” “ nay , sir , not yet ; i do entreat . and i do dare , sir—to be forbearing ! shall we not understand each other better than hitherto , captain ahab ? ”

melville	moby	all sail being set , he now cast loose the life-line , reserved for swaying him to the main royal-mast head ; and in a few moments they were hoisting him thither , when , while but two thirds of the way aloft , and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the main-top-sail and top-gallant-sail , he raised a gull-like cry in the air . “ there she blows ! —there she blows ! a hump like a snow-hill ! it is moby dick ! ”
melville	moby	“ _grand contested election for the presidency of the united states._ “ whaling voyage by one ishmael . “ bloody battle in affghanistan. ” though i can not tell why it was exactly that those stage managers , the fates , put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage , when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies , and short and easy parts in genteel comedies , and jolly parts in farces—though i can not tell why this was exactly ; yet , now that i recall all the circumstances , i think i can see a little into the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises , induced me to set about performing the part i did , besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment .
melville	moby	chapter 111 . the pacific . when gliding by the bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great south sea ; were it not for other things , i could have greeted my dear pacific with uncounted thanks , for now the long supplication of my youth was answered ; that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a thousand leagues of blue .
melville	moby	one of the wild suggestions referred to , as at last coming to be linked with the white whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined , was the unearthly conceit that moby dick was ubiquitous ; that he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time .
melville	moby	again and again to such gamesome talk , the dexterous dart is repeated , the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful leash . the agonized whale goes into his flurry ; the tow-line is slackened , and the pitchpoler dropping astern , folds his hands , and mutely watches the monster die .
melville	moby	this done , perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one , when ahab stayed his hand , and said he would weld his own iron . as , then , with regular , gasping hems , he hammered on the anvil , perth passing to him the glowing rods , one after the other , and the hard pressed forge shooting up its intense straight flame , the parsee passed silently , and bowing over his head towards the fire , seemed invoking some curse or some blessing on the toil . but , as ahab looked up , he slid aside .
melville	moby	consider , now , how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging one unusually strong , active , and knowing whale ; when owing to these qualities in him , as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of such an audacious enterprise , eight or ten loose second irons may be simultaneously dangling about him . for , of course , each boat is supplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first one be ineffectually darted without recovery . all these particulars are faithfully narrated here , as they will not fail to elucidate several most important , however intricate passages , in scenes hereafter to be painted .
melville	moby	in obedience to a sign from ahab , starbuck was now pulling obliquely across stubb ’ s bow ; and when for a minute or so the two boats were pretty near to each other , stubb hailed the mate .
melville	moby	such is the subtle elasticity of the organ i treat of , that whether wielded in sport , or in earnest , or in anger , whatever be the mood it be in , its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace . therein no fairy ’ s arm can transcend it .
melville	moby	but , as yet , stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was going on so nigh him , no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of his own epicurean lips .
melville	moby	chapter 49 . the hyena . there are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical joke , though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns , and more than suspects that the joke is at nobody ’ s expense but his own . however , nothing dispirits , and nothing seems worth while disputing . he bolts down all events , all creeds , and beliefs , and persuasions , all hard things visible and invisible , never mind how knobby ; as an ostrich of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints . and as for small difficulties and worryings , prospects of sudden disaster , peril of life and limb ; all these , and death itself , seem to him only sly , good-natured hits , and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old joker . that odd sort of wayward mood i am speaking of , comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation ; it comes in the very midst of his earnestness , so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing most momentous , now seems but a part of the general joke . there is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial , desperado philosophy ; and with it i now regarded this whole voyage of the pequod , and the great white whale its object .
melville	moby	“ stand not by me , but stand under me , whoever you are that will now help stubb ; for stubb , too , sticks here . i grin at thee , thou grinning whale ! who ever helped stubb , or kept stubb awake , but stubb ’ s own unwinking eye ? and now poor stubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that is all too soft ; would it were stuffed with brushwood ! i grin at thee , thou grinning whale ! look ye , sun , moon , and stars ! i call ye assassins of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost . for all that , i would yet ring glasses with ye , would ye but hand the cup ! oh , oh ! oh , oh ! thou grinning whale , but there ’ ll be plenty of gulping soon ! why fly ye not , o ahab ! for me , off shoes and jacket to it ; let stubb die in his drawers ! a most mouldy and over salted death , though ; —cherries ! cherries ! cherries ! oh , flask , for one red cherry ere we die ! ”
melville	moby	whether fagged by the three days ’ running chase , and the resistance to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore ; or whether it was some latent deceitfulness and malice in him : whichever was true , the white whale ’ s way now began to abate , as it seemed , from the boat so rapidly nearing him once more ; though indeed the whale ’ s last start had not been so long a one as before . and still as ahab glided over the waves the unpitying sharks accompanied him ; and so pertinaciously stuck to the boat ; and so continually bit at the plying oars , that the blades became jagged and crunched , and left small splinters in the sea , at almost every dip .
melville	moby	it may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will be found among the oldest hindoo , egyptian , and grecian sculptures . for ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble panellings of temples , the pedestals of statues , and on shields , medallions , cups , and coins , the dolphin was drawn in scales of chain-armor like saladin ’ s , and a helmeted head like st. george ’ s ; ever since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed , not only in most popular pictures of the whale , but in many scientific presentations of him .
melville	moby	sir ? hold ; while prometheus is about it , i ’ ll order a complete man after a desirable pattern . imprimis , fifty feet high in his socks ; then , chest modelled after the thames tunnel ; then , legs with roots to ’ em , to stay in one place ; then , arms three feet through the wrist ; no heart at all , brass forehead , and about a quarter of an acre of fine brains ; and let me see—shall i order eyes to see outwards ? no , but put a sky-light on top of his head to illuminate inwards . there , take the order , and away .
melville	moby	the one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold , was his vice-bench ; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several vices , of different sizes , and both of iron and of wood . at all times except when whales were alongside , this bench was securely lashed athwartships against the rear of the try-works .
melville	moby	not very far distant flask ’ s boat was also lying breathlessly still ; its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead , a stout sort of post rooted in the keel , and rising some two feet above the level of the stern platform . it is used for catching turns with the whale line . its top is not more spacious than the palm of a man ’ s hand , and standing upon such a base as that , flask seemed perched at the mast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks . but little king-post was small and short , and at the same time little king-post was full of a large and tall ambition , so that this loggerhead stand-point of his did by no means satisfy king-post .
melville	moby	moreover , while in most other animals that i can now think of , the eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power , so as to produce one picture and not two to the brain ; the peculiar position of the whale ’ s eyes , effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of solid head , which towers between them like a great mountain separating two lakes in valleys ; this , of course , must wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ imparts . the whale , therefore , must see one distinct picture on this side , and another distinct picture on that side ; while all between must be profound darkness and nothingness to him . man may , in effect , be said to look out on the world from a sentry-box with two joined sashes for his window . but with the whale , these two sashes are separately inserted , making two distinct windows , but sadly impairing the view . this peculiarity of the whale ’ s eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery ; and to be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes .
melville	moby	but there was no time for shuddering , for now the savage went about something that completely fascinated my attention , and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen . going to his heavy grego , or wrapall , or dreadnaught , which he had previously hung on a chair , he fumbled in the pockets , and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a hunch on its back , and exactly the colour of a three days ’ old congo baby . remembering the embalmed head , at first i almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner . but seeing that it was not at all limber , and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony , i concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol , which indeed it proved to be . for now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place , and removing the papered fire-board , sets up this little hunch-backed image , like a tenpin , between the andirons . the chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty , so that i thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his congo idol .
melville	moby	“ i am going to put him down for the three hundredth , ” said peleg , “ do ye hear that , bildad ! the three hundredth lay , i say. ” bildad laid down his book , and turning solemnly towards him said , “ captain peleg , thou hast a generous heart ; but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship—widows and orphans , many of them—and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man , we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans . the seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay , captain peleg . ”
melville	moby	during my researches in the leviathanic histories , i stumbled upon an ancient dutch volume , which , by the musty whaling smell of it , i knew must be about whalers . the title was , “ dan coopman , ” wherefore i concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some amsterdam cooper in the fishery , as every whale ship must carry its cooper . i was reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one “ fitz swackhammer. ” but my friend dr. snodhead , a very learned man , professor of low dutch and high german in the college of santa claus and st. pott ’ s , to whom i handed the work for translation , giving him a box of sperm candles for his trouble—this same dr. snodhead , so soon as he spied the book , assured me that “ dan coopman ” did not mean “ the cooper , ” but “ the merchant. ” in short , this ancient and learned low dutch book treated of the commerce of holland ; and , among other subjects , contained a very interesting account of its whale fishery . and in this chapter it was , headed , “ smeer , ” or “ fat , ” that i found a long detailed list of the outfits for the larders and cellars of 180 sail of dutch whalemen ; from which list , as translated by dr. snodhead , i transcribe the following :
melville	moby	at that moment starbuck caught sight of stubb ’ s face slowly beginning to glimmer into sight . glancing upwards , he cried : “ see ! see ! ” and once more the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled supernaturalness in their pallor .
melville	moby	to any meditative magian rover , this serene pacific , once beheld , must ever after be the sea of his adoption . it rolls the midmost waters of the world , the indian ocean and atlantic being but its arms . the same waves wash the moles of the new-built californian towns , but yesterday planted by the recentest race of men , and lave the faded but still gorgeous skirts of asiatic lands , older than abraham ; while all between float milky-ways of coral isles , and low-lying , endless , unknown archipelagoes , and impenetrable japans . thus this mysterious , divine pacific zones the world ’ s whole bulk about ; makes all coasts one bay to it ; seems the tide-beating heart of earth . lifted by those eternal swells , you needs must own the seductive god , bowing your head to pan .
melville	moby	when i stand among these mighty leviathan skeletons , skulls , tusks , jaws , ribs , and vertebræ , all characterized by partial resemblances to the existing breeds of sea-monsters ; but at the same time bearing on the other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical leviathans , their incalculable seniors ; i am , by a flood , borne back to that wondrous period , ere time itself can be said to have begun ; for time began with man . here saturn ’ s grey chaos rolls over me , and i obtain dim , shuddering glimpses into those polar eternities ; when wedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the tropics ; and in all the 25,000 miles of this world ’ s circumference , not an inhabitable hand ’ s breadth of land was visible . then the whole world was the whale ’ s ; and , king of creation , he left his wake along the present lines of the andes and the himmalehs . who can show a pedigree like leviathan ? ahab ’ s harpoon had shed older blood than the pharaoh ’ s . methuselah seems a school-boy . i look round to shake hands with shem . i am horror-struck at this antemosaic , unsourced existence of the unspeakable terrors of the whale , which , having been before all time , must needs exist after all humane ages are over .
melville	moby	the ribs were ten on a side . the first , to begin from the neck , was nearly six feet long ; the second , third , and fourth were each successively longer , till you came to the climax of the fifth , or one of the middle ribs , which measured eight feet and some inches . from that part , the remaining ribs diminished , till the tenth and last only spanned five feet and some inches . in general thickness , they all bore a seemly correspondence to their length . the middle ribs were the most arched . in some of the arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay footpath bridges over small streams .
melville	moby	as for the white shark , the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that creature , when beheld in his ordinary moods , strangely tallies with the same quality in the polar quadruped . this peculiarity is most vividly hit by the french in the name they bestow upon that fish . the romish mass for the dead begins with “ requiem eternam ” ( eternal rest ) , whence _requiem_ denominating the mass itself , and any other funeral music . now , in allusion to the white , silent stillness of death in this shark , and the mild deadliness of his habits , the french call him _requin_ .
melville	moby	but even stripped of these supernatural surmisings , there was enough in the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike the imagination with unwonted power . for , it was not so much his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales , but , as was elsewhere thrown out—a peculiar snow-white wrinkled forehead , and a high , pyramidical white hump . these were his prominent features ; the tokens whereby , even in the limitless , uncharted seas , he revealed his identity , at a long distance , to those who knew him .
melville	moby	“ give me a chance , then , ” said the englishman , good-humoredly . “ well , this old great-grandfather , with the white head and hump , runs all afoam into the pod , and goes to snapping furiously at my fast-line !
melville	moby	“ grin away ; we ’ ll see what turns up . hark ye , cabaco , there is somebody down in the after-hold that has not yet been seen on deck ; and i suspect our old mogul knows something of it too . i heard stubb tell flask , one morning watch , that there was something of that sort in the wind . ”
melville	moby	mayhew having concluded his narration , ahab put such questions to him , that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he intended to hunt the white whale , if opportunity should offer . to which ahab answered— “ aye. ” straightway , then , gabriel once more started to his feet , glaring upon the old man , and vehemently exclaimed , with downward pointed finger— “ think , think of the blasphemer—dead , and down there ! —beware of the blasphemer ’ s end ! ”
melville	moby	the natural aptitude of the french for seizing the picturesqueness of things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings they have of their whaling scenes . with not one tenth of england ’ s experience in the fishery , and not the thousandth part of that of the americans , they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale hunt . for the most part , the english and american whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline of things , such as the vacant profile of the whale ; which , so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned , is about tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid . even scoresby , the justly renowned right whaleman , after giving us a stiff full length of the greenland whale , and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and porpoises , treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks , chopping knives , and grapnels ; and with the microscopic diligence of a leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety-six fac-similes of magnified arctic snow crystals . i mean no disparagement to the excellent voyager ( i honor him for a veteran ) , but in so important a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a greenland justice of the peace .
melville	moby	he paused a little ; then kneeling in the pulpit ’ s bows , folded his large brown hands across his chest , uplifted his closed eyes , and offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of the sea .
melville	moby	chapter 1 . loomings . call me ishmael . some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse , and nothing particular to interest me on shore , i thought i would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world . it is a way i have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation . whenever i find myself growing grim about the mouth ; whenever it is a damp , drizzly november in my soul ; whenever i find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses , and bringing up the rear of every funeral i meet ; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me , that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street , and methodically knocking people ’ s hats off—then , i account it high time to get to sea as soon as i can . this is my substitute for pistol and ball . with a philosophical flourish cato throws himself upon his sword ; i quietly take to the ship . there is nothing surprising in this . if they but knew it , almost all men in their degree , some time or other , cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me .
melville	moby	nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to ahab personally . having impulsively , it is probable , and perhaps somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the pequod ’ s voyage , ahab was now entirely conscious that , in so doing , he had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of usurpation ; and with perfect impunity , both moral and legal , his crew if so disposed , and to that end competent , could refuse all further obedience to him , and even violently wrest from him the command . from even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation , and the possible consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground , ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect himself . that protection could only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand , backed by a heedful , closely calculating attention to every minute atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be subjected to .
melville	moby	azore sailor . ( _ascending , and pitching the tambourine up the scuttle_ . ) here you are , pip ; and there ’ s the windlass-bitts ; up you mount ! now , boys ! ( _the half of them dance to the tambourine ; some go below ; some sleep or lie among the coils of rigging . oaths a-plenty_ . )
melville	moby	stubb ’ s exordium to his crew is given here at large , because he had rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general , and especially in inculcating the religion of rowing . but you must not suppose from this specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions with his congregation . not at all ; and therein consisted his chief peculiarity . he would say the most terrific things to his crew , in a tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury , and the fury seemed so calculated merely as a spice to the fun , that no oarsman could hear such queer invocations without pulling for dear life , and yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing . besides he all the time looked so easy and indolent himself , so loungingly managed his steering-oar , and so broadly gaped—open-mouthed at times—that the mere sight of such a yawning commander , by sheer force of contrast , acted like a charm upon the crew . then again , stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists , whose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous , as to put all inferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them .
melville	moby	it was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from the pequod ’ s mast-heads , announcing that the jungfrau was again lowering her boats ; though the only spout in sight was that of a fin-back , belonging to the species of uncapturable whales , because of its incredible power of swimming . nevertheless , the fin-back ’ s spout is so similar to the sperm whale ’ s , that by unskilful fishermen it is often mistaken for it . and consequently derick and all his host were now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute . the virgin crowding all sail , made after her four young keels , and thus they all disappeared far to leeward , still in bold , hopeful chase .
melville	moby	on the second day , numbers of right whales were seen , who , secure from the attack of a sperm whaler like the pequod , with open jaws sluggishly swam through the brit , which , adhering to the fringing fibres of that wondrous venetian blind in their mouths , was in that manner separated from the water that escaped at the lip .
melville	moby	“ what ’ s the old man have so much to do with him for ? ” “ striking up a swap or a bargain , i suppose. ” “ bargain ? —about what ? ” “ why , do ye see , the old man is hard bent after that white whale , and the devil there is trying to come round him , and get him to swap away his silver watch , or his soul , or something of that sort , and then he ’ ll surrender moby dick . ”
melville	moby	but at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took every eye from the whale . with a start all glared at dark ahab , who was surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air .
melville	moby	now , in calm weather , to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore . but the awful lonesomeness is intolerable . the intense concentration of self in the middle of such a heartless immensity , my god ! who can tell it ? mark , how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea—mark how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides .
melville	moby	chapter 2 . the carpet-bag . i stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag , tucked it under my arm , and started for cape horn and the pacific . quitting the good city of old manhatto , i duly arrived in new bedford . it was a saturday night in december . much was i disappointed upon learning that the little packet for nantucket had already sailed , and that no way of reaching that place would offer , till the following monday .
melville	moby	chapter 64 . stubb ’ s supper . stubb ’ s whale had been killed some distance from the ship . it was a calm ; so , forming a tandem of three boats , we commenced the slow business of towing the trophy to the pequod . and now , as we eighteen men with our thirty-six arms , and one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers , slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert , sluggish corpse in the sea ; and it seemed hardly to budge at all , except at long intervals ; good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we moved . for , upon the great canal of hang-ho , or whatever they call it , in china , four or five laborers on the foot-path will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour ; but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along , as if laden with pig-lead in bulk .
melville	moby	“ wonder if he means me ? —complimentary ! —poor lad ! —i could go hang myself . any way , for the present , i ’ ll quit pip ’ s vicinity . i can stand the rest , for they have plain wits ; but he ’ s too crazy-witty for my sanity . so , so , i leave him muttering . ”
melville	moby	at that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness , following the flashes , a voice was heard at his side ; and almost at the same instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead .
melville	moby	“ look at that chap now , ” philosophically drawled stubb , who , with his unlighted short pipe , mechanically retained between his teeth , at a short distance , followed after— “ he ’ s got fits , that flask has . fits ? yes , give him fits—that ’ s the very word—pitch fits into ’ em . merrily , merrily , hearts-alive . pudding for supper , you know ; —merry ’ s the word . pull , babes—pull , sucklings—pull , all . but what the devil are you hurrying about ? softly , softly , and steadily , my men . only pull , and keep pulling ; nothing more . crack all your backbones , and bite your knives in two—that ’ s all . take it easy—why don ’ t ye take it easy , i say , and burst all your livers and lungs ! ”
melville	moby	i was the attendant or page of queequeg , while busy at the mat . as i kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the long yarns of the warp , using my own hand for the shuttle , and as queequeg , standing sideways , ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the threads , and idly looking off upon the water , carelessly and unthinkingly drove home every yarn : i say so strange a dreaminess did there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea , only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword , that it seemed as if this were the loom of time , and i myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving and weaving away at the fates . there lay the fixed threads of the warp subject to but one single , ever returning , unchanging vibration , and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own . this warp seemed necessity ; and here , thought i , with my own hand i ply my own shuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads . meantime , queequeg ’ s impulsive , indifferent sword , sometimes hitting the woof slantingly , or crookedly , or strongly , or weakly , as the case might be ; and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric ; this savage ’ s sword , thought i , which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and woof ; this easy , indifferent sword must be chance—aye , chance , free will , and necessity—nowise incompatible—all interweavingly working together . the straight warp of necessity , not to be swerved from its ultimate course—its every alternating vibration , indeed , only tending to that ; free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads ; and chance , though restrained in its play within the right lines of necessity , and sideways in its motions directed by free will , though thus prescribed to by both , chance by turns rules either , and has the last featuring blow at events .
melville	moby	leaning over in his hammock , queequeg long regarded the coffin with an attentive eye . he then called for his harpoon , had the wooden stock drawn from it , and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of the paddles of his boat . all by his own request , also , biscuits were then ranged round the sides within : a flask of fresh water was placed at the head , and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot ; and a piece of sail-cloth being rolled up for a pillow , queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed , that he might make trial of its comforts , if any it had . he lay without moving a few minutes , then told one to go to his bag and bring out his little god , yojo . then crossing his arms on his breast with yojo between , he called for the coffin lid ( hatch he called it ) to be placed over him . the head part turned over with a leather hinge , and there lay queequeg in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in view . “ rarmai ” ( it will do ; it is easy ) , he murmured at last , and signed to be replaced in his hammock .

melville	moby	meantime , ahab , out of hearing of his officers , having sided the furthest to windward , was still ranging ahead of the other boats ; a circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him . those tiger yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone ; like five trip-hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength , which periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst boiler out of a mississippi steamer . as for fedallah , who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar , he had thrown aside his black jacket , and displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the gunwale , clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery horizon ; while at the other end of the boat ahab , with one arm , like a fencer ’ s , thrown half backward into the air , as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip ; ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat lowerings ere the white whale had torn him . all at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed , while the boat ’ s five oars were seen simultaneously peaked . boat and crew sat motionless on the sea . instantly the three spread boats in the rear paused on their way . the whales had irregularly settled bodily down into the blue , thus giving no distantly discernible token of the movement , though from his closer vicinity ahab had observed it .
melville	moby	it was about nine o ’ clock at night that the pequod ’ s try-works were first started on this present voyage . it belonged to stubb to oversee the business . “ all ready there ? off hatch , then , and start her . you cook , fire the works. ” this was an easy thing , for the carpenter had been thrusting his shavings into the furnace throughout the passage . here be it said that in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try-works has to be fed for a time with wood . after that no wood is used , except as a means of quick ignition to the staple fuel . in a word , after being tried out , the crisp , shrivelled blubber , now called scraps or fritters , still contains considerable of its unctuous properties . these fritters feed the flames . like a plethoric burning martyr , or a self-consuming misanthrope , once ignited , the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by his own body . would that he consumed his own smoke ! for his smoke is horrible to inhale , and inhale it you must , and not only that , but you must live in it for the time . it has an unspeakable , wild , hindoo odor about it , such as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres . it smells like the left wing of the day of judgment ; it is an argument for the pit .
melville	moby	but agonizing as was the wound of this whale , and an appalling spectacle enough , any way ; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to inspire the rest of the herd , was owing to a cause which at first the intervening distance obscured from us . but at length we perceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery , this whale had become entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed ; he had also run away with the cutting-spade in him ; and while the free end of the rope attached to that weapon , had permanently caught in the coils of the harpoon-line round his tail , the cutting-spade itself had worked loose from his flesh . so that tormented to madness , he was now churning through the water , violently flailing with his flexible tail , and tossing the keen spade about him , wounding and murdering his own comrades .
melville	moby	but upon investigation we find , that not only are the whales of the present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are found in the tertiary system ( embracing a distinct geological period prior to man ) , but of the whales found in that tertiary system , those belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier ones .
melville	moby	circumambulate the city of a dreamy sabbath afternoon . go from corlears hook to coenties slip , and from thence , by whitehall , northward . what do you see ? —posted like silent sentinels all around the town , stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries . some leaning against the spiles ; some seated upon the pier-heads ; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from china ; some high aloft in the rigging , as if striving to get a still better seaward peep . but these are all landsmen ; of week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied to counters , nailed to benches , clinched to desks . how then is this ? are the green fields gone ? what do they here ?
melville	moby	“ have ye shipped in her ? ” he repeated . “ you mean the ship pequod , i suppose , ” said i , trying to gain a little more time for an uninterrupted look at him . “ aye , the pequod—that ship there , ” he said , drawing back his whole arm , and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him , with the fixed bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object .
melville	moby	“ the mighty whales which swim in a sea of water , and have a sea of oil swimming in them. ” —_fuller ’ s profane and holy state_ . “ so close behind some promontory lie the huge leviathan to attend their prey , and give no chance , but swallow in the fry , which through their gaping jaws mistake the way. ” —_dryden ’ s annus mirabilis_ .
melville	moby	let us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand , cant over the sperm whale ’ s head , that it may lie bottom up ; then , ascending by a ladder to the summit , have a peep down the mouth ; and were it not that the body is now completely separated from it , with a lantern we might descend into the great kentucky mammoth cave of his stomach . but let us hold on here by this tooth , and look about us where we are . what a really beautiful and chaste-looking mouth ! from floor to ceiling , lined , or rather papered with a glistening white membrane , glossy as bridal satins .
melville	moby	but you must look at this matter in every light . though so short a period ago—not a good lifetime—the census of the buffalo in illinois exceeded the census of men now in london , and though at the present day not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region ; and though the cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man ; yet the far different nature of the whale-hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious an end to the leviathan . forty men in one ship hunting the sperm whales for forty-eight months think they have done extremely well , and thank god , if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish . whereas , in the days of the old canadian and indian hunters and trappers of the west , when the far west ( in whose sunset suns still rise ) was a wilderness and a virgin , the same number of moccasined men , for the same number of months , mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships , would have slain not forty , but forty thousand and more buffaloes ; a fact that , if need were , could be statistically stated .
melville	moby	let me make a clean breast of it here , and frankly admit that i kept but sorry guard . with the problem of the universe revolving in me , how could i—being left completely to myself at such a thought-engendering altitude—how could i but lightly hold my obligations to observe all whale-ships ’ standing orders , “ keep your weather eye open , and sing out every time . ”
melville	moby	“ though no small passage was before her , yet , if the commonest chance favoured , he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way , because his pumps were of the best , and being periodically relieved at them , those six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep the ship free ; never mind if the leak should double on her . in truth , well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes , the town-ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the least fatality , had it not been for the brutal overbearing of radney , the mate , a vineyarder , and the bitterly provoked vengeance of steelkilt , a lakeman and desperado from buffalo .

melville	moby	the boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks , leaving a narrow dardanelles between their long lengths . but by desperate endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening ; then giving way rapidly , and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet . after many similar hair-breadth escapes , we at last swiftly glided into what had just been one of the outer circles , but now crossed by random whales , all violently making for one centre . this lucky salvation was cheaply purchased by the loss of queequeg ’ s hat , who , while standing in the bows to prick the fugitive whales , had his hat taken clean from his head by the air-eddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes close by .
melville	moby	chapter 7 . the chapel . in this same new bedford there stands a whaleman ’ s chapel , and few are the moody fishermen , shortly bound for the indian ocean or pacific , who fail to make a sunday visit to the spot . i am sure that i did not .
melville	moby	“ in the year 1690 some persons were on a high hill observing the whales spouting and sporting with each other , when one observed : there—pointing to the sea—is a green pasture where our children ’ s grand-children will go for bread. ” —_obed macy ’ s history of nantucket_ .
melville	moby	“ no , you didn ’ t , cook ; but i ’ ll tell you what i ’ m coming to , cook . you must go home and be born over again ; you don ’ t know how to cook a whale-steak yet . ”
melville	moby	at the same foam-fountain , queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me . his dusky nostrils swelled apart ; he showed his filed and pointed teeth . on , on we flew ; and our offing gained , the moss did homage to the blast ; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the sultan . sideways leaning , we sideways darted ; every ropeyarn tingling like a wire ; the two tall masts buckling like indian canes in land tornadoes . so full of this reeling scene were we , as we stood by the plunging bowsprit , that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers , a lubber-like assembly , who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so companionable ; as though a white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro . but there were some boobies and bumpkins there , who , by their intense greenness , must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure . queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his back . i thought the bumpkin ’ s hour of doom was come . dropping his harpoon , the brawny savage caught him in his arms , and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength , sent him high up bodily into the air ; then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset , the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet , while queequeg , turning his back upon him , lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff .
melville	moby	whether to admit hercules among us or not , concerning this i long remained dubious : for though according to the greek mythologies , that antique crockett and kit carson—that brawny doer of rejoicing good deeds , was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale ; still , whether that strictly makes a whaleman of him , that might be mooted . it nowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish , unless , indeed , from the inside . nevertheless , he may be deemed a sort of involuntary whaleman ; at any rate the whale caught him , if he did not the whale . i claim him for one of our clan .
melville	moby	“ i should like to see him try it ; i ’ d give him such a pair of black eyes that he wouldn ’ t dare to show his face in the admiral ’ s cabin again for a long while , let alone down in the orlop there , where he lives , and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much . damn the devil , flask ; so you suppose i ’ m afraid of the devil ? who ’ s afraid of him , except the old governor who daresn ’ t catch him and put him in double-darbies , as he deserves , but lets him go about kidnapping people ; aye , and signed a bond with him , that all the people the devil kidnapped , he ’ d roast for him ? there ’ s a governor ! ”
melville	moby	now , as many sperm whales had been captured off the western coast of java , in the near vicinity of the straits of sunda ; indeed , as most of the ground , roundabout , was generally recognised by the fishermen as an excellent spot for cruising ; therefore , as the pequod gained more and more upon java head , the look-outs were repeatedly hailed , and admonished to keep wide awake . but though the green palmy cliffs of the land soon loomed on the starboard bow , and with delighted nostrils the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air , yet not a single jet was descried . almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game hereabouts , the ship had well nigh entered the straits , when the customary cheering cry was heard from aloft , and ere long a spectacle of singular magnificence saluted us .
melville	moby	“ god keep me ! —keep us all ! ” murmured starbuck , lowly . but in his joy at the enchanted , tacit acquiescence of the mate , ahab did not hear his foreboding invocation ; nor yet the low laugh from the hold ; nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage ; nor yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts , as for a moment their hearts sank in . for again starbuck ’ s downcast eyes lighted up with the stubbornness of life ; the subterranean laugh died away ; the winds blew on ; the sails filled out ; the ship heaved and rolled as before . ah , ye admonitions and warnings ! why stay ye not when ye come ? but rather are ye predictions than warnings , ye shadows ! yet not so much predictions from without , as verifications of the foregoing things within . for with little external to constrain us , the innermost necessities in our being , these still drive us on .
melville	moby	“ myself have agreed to try whether i can master and kill this sperma-ceti whale , for i could never hear of any of that sort that was killed by any man , such is his fierceness and swiftness. ” —_richard strafford ’ s letter from the bermudas . phil . trans . a.d._ 1668 .
melville	moby	now , while discoursing of sperm , it behooves to speak of other things akin to it , in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the try-works . first comes white-horse , so called , which is obtained from the tapering part of the fish , and also from the thicker portions of his flukes . it is tough with congealed tendons—a wad of muscle—but still contains some oil . after being severed from the whale , the white-horse is first cut into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer . they look much like blocks of berkshire marble .
melville	moby	“ who ’ s got some paregoric ? ” said stubb , “ he has the stomach-ache , i ’ m afraid . lord , think of having half an acre of stomach-ache ! adverse winds are holding mad christmas in him , boys . it ’ s the first foul wind i ever knew to blow from astern ; but look , did ever whale yaw so before ? it must be , he ’ s lost his tiller . ”
melville	moby	* see subsequent chapters for something more on this head . grant it , since you cite it ; but , say what you will , there is no real dignity in whaling . _no dignity in whaling ? _ the dignity of our calling the very heavens attest . cetus is a constellation in the south ! no more ! drive down your hat in presence of the czar , and take it off to queequeg ! no more ! i know a man that , in his lifetime , has taken three hundred and fifty whales . i account that man more honorable than that great captain of antiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns .

melville	moby	but , at last , when turning to the eastward , the cape winds began howling around us , and we rose and fell upon the long , troubled seas that are there ; when the ivory-tusked pequod sharply bowed to the blast , and gored the dark waves in her madness , till , like showers of silver chips , the foam-flakes flew over her bulwarks ; then all this desolate vacuity of life went away , but gave place to sights more dismal than before .
melville	moby	full in this rapid wake , and many fathoms in the rear , swam a huge , humped old bull , which by his comparatively slow progress , as well as by the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him , seemed afflicted with the jaundice , or some other infirmity . whether this whale belonged to the pod in advance , seemed questionable ; for it is not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social . nevertheless , he stuck to their wake , though indeed their back water must have retarded him , because the white-bone or swell at his broad muzzle was a dashed one , like the swell formed when two hostile currents meet . his spout was short , slow , and laborious ; coming forth with a choking sort of gush , and spending itself in torn shreds , followed by strange subterranean commotions in him , which seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity , causing the waters behind him to upbubble .
melville	moby	now , as i before hinted , i have no objection to any person ’ s religion , be it what it may , so long as that person does not kill or insult any other person , because that other person don ’ t believe it also . but when a man ’ s religion becomes really frantic ; when it is a positive torment to him ; and , in fine , makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in ; then i think it high time to take that individual aside and argue the point with him .
melville	moby	“ why sing ye not out for him , if ye see him ? ” cried ahab , when , after the lapse of some minutes since the first cry , no more had been heard . “ sway me up , men ; ye have been deceived ; not moby dick casts one odd jet that way , and then disappears . ”
melville	moby	setting sail to the rising wind , the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to leeward , by both oars and canvas . and at last when ahab was sliding by the vessel , so near as plainly to distinguish starbuck ’ s face as he leaned over the rail , he hailed him to turn the vessel about , and follow him , not too swiftly , at a judicious interval . glancing upwards , he saw tashtego , queequeg , and daggoo , eagerly mounting to the three mast-heads ; while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats which had but just been hoisted to the side , and were busily at work in repairing them . one after the other , through the port-holes , as he sped , he also caught flying glimpses of stubb and flask , busying themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances . as he saw all this ; as he heard the hammers in the broken boats ; far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart . but he rallied . and now marking that the vane or flag was gone from the main-mast-head , he shouted to tashtego , who had just gained that perch , to descend again for another flag , and a hammer and nails , and so nail it to the mast .
melville	moby	it is a thing well known to both american and english whale-ships , and as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by scoresby , that some whales have been captured far north in the pacific , in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the greenland seas . nor is it to be gainsaid , that in some of these instances it has been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could not have exceeded very many days . hence , by inference , it has been believed by some whalemen , that the nor ’ west passage , so long a problem to man , was never a problem to the whale . so that here , in the real living experience of living men , the prodigies related in old times of the inland strello mountain in portugal ( near whose top there was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface ) ; and that still more wonderful story of the arethusa fountain near syracuse ( whose waters were believed to have come from the holy land by an underground passage ) ; these fabulous narrations are almost fully equalled by the realities of the whalemen .
melville	moby	all these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness , and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations , and jumping into bed with me , i thought it was high time , now or never , before the light was put out , to break the spell in which i had so long been bound .

melville	moby	accessory , perhaps , to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about to do , were certain prudential motives , whose object might have been to revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill , in a matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses . besides , the old man well knew that to steer by transpointed needles , though clumsily practicable , was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious sailors , without some shudderings and evil portents .
melville	moby	of the names in this list of whale authors , only those following owen ever saw living whales ; and but one of them was a real professional harpooneer and whaleman . i mean captain scoresby . on the separate subject of the greenland or right-whale , he is the best existing authority . but scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale , compared with which the greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning . and here be it said , that the greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas . he is not even by any means the largest of the whales . yet , owing to the long priority of his claims , and the profound ignorance which , till some seventy years back , invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm-whale , and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whale-ports ; this usurpation has been every way complete . reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days , will satisfy you that the greenland whale , without one rival , was to them the monarch of the seas . but the time has at last come for a new proclamation . this is charing cross ; hear ye ! good people all , —the greenland whale is deposed , —the great sperm whale now reigneth !
melville	moby	thus , then , the muffled rollings of a milky sea ; the bleak rustlings of the festooned frosts of mountains ; the desolate shiftings of the windrowed snows of prairies ; all these , to ishmael , are as the shaking of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt !
melville	moby	the ship was now kept away from the wind , and she went gently rolling before it . tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to leeward , we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of our bows . for that singular craft at times evinced by the sperm whale when , sounding with his head in one direction , he nevertheless , while concealed beneath the surface , mills round , and swiftly swims off in the opposite quarter—this deceitfulness of his could not now be in action ; for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by tashtego had been in any way alarmed , or indeed knew at all of our vicinity . one of the men selected for shipkeepers—that is , those not appointed to the boats , by this time relieved the indian at the main-mast head . the sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down ; the line tubs were fixed in their places ; the cranes were thrust out ; the mainyard was backed , and the three boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over high cliffs . outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand clung to the rail , while one foot was expectantly poised on the gunwale . so look the long line of man-of-war ’ s men about to throw themselves on board an enemy ’ s ship .
melville	moby	slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle , ahab leaned over the side and watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze , the more and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity . but the lovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel , for a moment , the cankerous thing in his soul . that glad , happy air , that winsome sky , did at last stroke and caress him ; the step-mother world , so long cruel—forbidding—now threw affectionate arms round his stubborn neck , and did seem to joyously sob over him , as if over one , that however wilful and erring , she could yet find it in her heart to save and to bless . from beneath his slouched hat ahab dropped a tear into the sea ; nor did all the pacific contain such wealth as that one wee drop .
melville	moby	nor does this—its amazing strength , at all tend to cripple the graceful flexion of its motions ; where infantileness of ease undulates through a titanism of power . on the contrary , those motions derive their most appalling beauty from it . real strength never impairs beauty or harmony , but it often bestows it ; and in everything imposingly beautiful , strength has much to do with the magic . take away the tied tendons that all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved hercules , and its charm would be gone . as devout eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse of goethe , he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man , that seemed as a roman triumphal arch . when angelo paints even god the father in human form , mark what robustness is there . and whatever they may reveal of the divine love in the son , the soft , curled , hermaphroditical italian pictures , in which his idea has been most successfully embodied ; these pictures , so destitute as they are of all brawniness , hint nothing of any power , but the mere negative , feminine one of submission and endurance , which on all hands it is conceded , form the peculiar practical virtues of his teachings .

melville	moby	the entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews ; but cut into it , and you find that three distinct strata compose it : —upper , middle , and lower . the fibres in the upper and lower layers , are long and horizontal ; those of the middle one , very short , and running crosswise between the outside layers . this triune structure , as much as anything else , imparts power to the tail . to the student of old roman walls , the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful relics of the antique , and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the great strength of the masonry .
melville	moby	as every one knows , these same “ hogs ’ bristles , ” “ fins , ” “ whiskers , ” “ blinds , ” or whatever you please , furnish to the ladies their busks and other stiffening contrivances . but in this particular , the demand has long been on the decline . it was in queen anne ’ s time that the bone was in its glory , the farthingale being then all the fashion . and as those ancient dames moved about gaily , though in the jaws of the whale , as you may say ; even so , in a shower , with the like thoughtlessness , do we nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection ; the umbrella being a tent spread over the same bone .
melville	moby	now when i looked about the quarter-deck , for some one having authority , in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage , at first i saw nobody ; but i could not well overlook a strange sort of tent , or rather wigwam , pitched a little behind the main-mast . it seemed only a temporary erection used in port . it was of a conical shape , some ten feet high ; consisting of the long , huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right-whale . planted with their broad ends on the deck , a circle of these slabs laced together , mutually sloped towards each other , and at the apex united in a tufted point , where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some old pottowottamie sachem ’ s head . a triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship , so that the insider commanded a complete view forward .
melville	moby	“ i was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it , ” muttered stubb , as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle . “ it ’ s very queer . stop , stubb ; somehow , now , i don ’ t well know whether to go back and strike him , or—what ’ s that ? —down here on my knees and pray for him ? yes , that was the thought coming up in me ; but it would be the first time i ever _did_ pray . it ’ s queer ; very queer ; and he ’ s queer too ; aye , take him fore and aft , he ’ s about the queerest old man stubb ever sailed with . how he flashed at me ! —his eyes like powder-pans ! is he mad ? anyway there ’ s something on his mind , as sure as there must be something on a deck when it cracks . he aint in his bed now , either , more than three hours out of the twenty-four ; and he don ’ t sleep then . didn ’ t that dough-boy , the steward , tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man ’ s hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled , and the sheets down at the foot , and the coverlid almost tied into knots , and the pillow a sort of frightful hot , as though a baked brick had been on it ? a hot old man ! i guess he ’ s got what some folks ashore call a conscience ; it ’ s a kind of tic-dolly-row they say—worse nor a toothache . well , well ; i don ’ t know what it is , but the lord keep me from catching it . he ’ s full of riddles ; i wonder what he goes into the after hold for , every night , as dough-boy tells me he suspects ; what ’ s that for , i should like to know ? who ’ s made appointments with him in the hold ? ain ’ t that queer , now ? but there ’ s no telling , it ’ s the old game—here goes for a snooze . damn me , it ’ s worth a fellow ’ s while to be born into the world , if only to fall right asleep . and now that i think of it , that ’ s about the first thing babies do , and that ’ s a sort of queer , too . damn me , but all things are queer , come to think of ’ em . but that ’ s against my principles . think not , is my eleventh commandment ; and sleep when you can , is my twelfth—so here goes again . but how ’ s that ? didn ’ t he call me a dog ? blazes ! he called me ten times a donkey , and piled a lot of jackasses on top of _that ! _ he might as well have kicked me , and done with it . maybe he _did_ kick me , and i didn ’ t observe it , i was so taken all aback with his brow , somehow . it flashed like a bleached bone . what the devil ’ s the matter with me ? i don ’ t stand right on my legs . coming afoul of that old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out . by the lord , i must have been dreaming , though—how ? how ? how ? —but the only way ’ s to stash it ; so here goes to hammock again ; and in the morning , i ’ ll see how this plaguey juggling thinks over by daylight . ”
melville	moby	it is plain , then , that phrenologically the head of this leviathan , in the creature ’ s living intact state , is an entire delusion . as for his true brain , you can then see no indications of it , nor feel any . the whale , like all things that are mighty , wears a false brow to the common world .
melville	moby	and now abating in his flurry , the whale once more rolled out into view ; surging from side to side ; spasmodically dilating and contracting his spout-hole , with sharp , cracking , agonized respirations . at last , gush after gush of clotted red gore , as if it had been the purple lees of red wine , shot into the frighted air ; and falling back again , ran dripping down his motionless flanks into the sea . his heart had burst !
melville	moby	close to our bows , strange forms in the water darted hither and thither before us ; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea-ravens . and every morning , perched on our stays , rows of these birds were seen ; and spite of our hootings , for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp , as though they deemed our ship some drifting , uninhabited craft ; a thing appointed to desolation , and therefore fit roosting-place for their homeless selves . and heaved and heaved , still unrestingly heaved the black sea , as if its vast tides were a conscience ; and the great mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bred .
melville	moby	now , when this strange circumstance was made known aft , the carpenter was at once commanded to do queequeg ’ s bidding , whatever it might include . there was some heathenish , coffin-coloured old lumber aboard , which , upon a long previous voyage , had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the lackaday islands , and from these dark planks the coffin was recommended to be made . no sooner was the carpenter apprised of the order , than taking his rule , he forthwith with all the indifferent promptitude of his character , proceeded into the forecastle and took queequeg ’ s measure with great accuracy , regularly chalking queequeg ’ s person as he shifted the rule .
melville	moby	“ i hold the spool , sir . but just as my captain says . with these grey hairs of mine ’ tis not worth while disputing , ’ specially with a superior , who ’ ll ne ’ er confess. ” “ what ’ s that ? there now ’ s a patched professor in queen nature ’ s granite-founded college ; but methinks he ’ s too subservient . where wert thou born ? ”
melville	moby	“ gracious ! queequeg , don ’ t sit there , ” said i . “ oh ! perry dood seat , ” said queequeg , “ my country way ; won ’ t hurt him face. ” “ face ! ” said i , “ call that his face ? very benevolent countenance then ; but how hard he breathes , he ’ s heaving himself ; get off , queequeg , you are heavy , it ’ s grinding the face of the poor . get off , queequeg ! look , he ’ ll twitch you off soon . i wonder he don ’ t wake . ”
melville	moby	some pretend to see a difference between the greenland whale of the english and the right whale of the americans . but they precisely agree in all their grand features ; nor has there yet been presented a single determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction . it is by endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences , that some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate . the right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length , with reference to elucidating the sperm whale .
melville	moby	chapter 90 . heads or tails . “ de balena vero sufficit , si rex habeat caput , et regina caudam. ” _bracton , l. 3 , c. 3._ latin from the books of the laws of england , which taken along with the context , means , that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of that land , the king , as honorary grand harpooneer , must have the head , and the queen be respectfully presented with the tail . a division which , in the whale , is much like halving an apple ; there is no intermediate remainder . now as this law , under a modified form , is to this day in force in england ; and as it offers in various respects a strange anomaly touching the general law of fast and loose-fish , it is here treated of in a separate chapter , on the same courteous principle that prompts the english railways to be at the expense of a separate car , specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty . in the first place , in curious proof of the fact that the above-mentioned law is still in force , i proceed to lay before you a circumstance that happened within the last two years .

melville	moby	often , when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid dreams of the night , which , resuming his own intense thoughts through the day , carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies , and whirled them round and round and round in his blazing brain , till the very throbbing of his life-spot became insufferable anguish ; and when , as was sometimes the case , these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up from its base , and a chasm seemed opening in him , from which forked flames and lightnings shot up , and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap down among them ; when this hell in himself yawned beneath him , a wild cry would be heard through the ship ; and with glaring eyes ahab would burst from his state room , as though escaping from a bed that was on fire . yet these , perhaps , instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness , or fright at his own resolve , were but the plainest tokens of its intensity . for , at such times , crazy ahab , the scheming , unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale ; this ahab that had gone to his hammock , was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror again . the latter was the eternal , living principle or soul in him ; and in sleep , being for the time dissociated from the characterizing mind , which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or agent , it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity of the frantic thing , of which , for the time , it was no longer an integral . but as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the soul , therefore it must have been that , in ahab ’ s case , yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose ; that purpose , by its own sheer inveteracy of will , forced itself against gods and devils into a kind of self-assumed , independent being of its own . nay , could grimly live and burn , while the common vitality to which it was conjoined , fled horror-stricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth . therefore , the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes , when what seemed ahab rushed from his room , was for the time but a vacated thing , a formless somnambulistic being , a ray of living light , to be sure , but without an object to colour , and therefore a blankness in itself . god help thee , old man , thy thoughts have created a creature in thee ; and he whose intense thinking thus makes him a prometheus ; a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever ; that vulture the very creature he creates .
melville	moby	look your last , now , on these venerable hooded heads , while they yet lie together ; for one will soon sink , unrecorded , in the sea ; the other will not be very long in following .
melville	moby	riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was , it soon resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement ; for having clumped together at last in one dense body , they then renewed their onward flight with augmented fleetness . further pursuit was useless ; but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged whales might be dropped astern , and likewise to secure one which flask had killed and waifed . the waif is a pennoned pole , two or three of which are carried by every boat ; and which , when additional game is at hand , are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale , both to mark its place on the sea , and also as token of prior possession , should the boats of any other ship draw near .
melville	moby	“ upon hearing the frantic project of their leader , each in his own separate soul had suddenly lighted , it would seem , upon the same piece of treachery , namely : to be foremost in breaking out , in order to be the first of the three , though the last of the ten , to surrender ; and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit . but when steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to the last , they in some way , by some subtle chemistry of villany , mixed their before secret treacheries together ; and when their leader fell into a doze , verbally opened their souls to each other in three sentences ; and bound the sleeper with cords , and gagged him with cords ; and shrieked out for the captain at midnight .
melville	moby	at last we gained such an offing , that the two pilots were needed no longer . the stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began ranging alongside . it was curious and not unpleasing , how peleg and bildad were affected at this juncture , especially captain bildad . for loath to depart , yet ; very loath to leave , for good , a ship bound on so long and perilous a voyage—beyond both stormy capes ; a ship in which some thousands of his hard earned dollars were invested ; a ship , in which an old shipmate sailed as captain ; a man almost as old as he , once more starting to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw ; loath to say good-bye to a thing so every way brimful of every interest to him , —poor old bildad lingered long ; paced the deck with anxious strides ; ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell word there ; again came on deck , and looked to windward ; looked towards the wide and endless waters , only bounded by the far-off unseen eastern continents ; looked towards the land ; looked aloft ; looked right and left ; looked everywhere and nowhere ; and at last , mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin , convulsively grasped stout peleg by the hand , and holding up a lantern , for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face , as much as to say , “ nevertheless , friend peleg , i can stand it ; yes , i can . ”
melville	moby	* i am aware that down to the present time , the fish styled lamatins and dugongs ( pig-fish and sow-fish of the coffins of nantucket ) are included by many naturalists among the whales . but as these pig-fish are a noisy , contemptible set , mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers , and feeding on wet hay , and especially as they do not spout , i deny their credentials as whales ; and have presented them with their passports to quit the kingdom of cetology .

melville	moby	by hints , i asked him whether he did not propose going back , and having a coronation ; since he might now consider his father dead and gone , he being very old and feeble at the last accounts . he answered no , not yet ; and added that he was fearful christianity , or rather christians , had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan kings before him . but by and by , he said , he would return , —as soon as he felt himself baptized again . for the nonce , however , he proposed to sail about , and sow his wild oats in all four oceans . they had made a harpooneer of him , and that barbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre now .
melville	moby	chapter 36 . the quarter-deck . ( _enter ahab : then , all._ ) it was not a great while after the affair of the pipe , that one morning shortly after breakfast , ahab , as was his wont , ascended the cabin-gangway to the deck . there most sea-captains usually walk at that hour , as country gentlemen , after the same meal , take a few turns in the garden .
melville	moby	“ then be called ten times a donkey , and a mule , and an ass , and begone , or i ’ ll clear the world of thee ! ” as he said this , ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in his aspect , that stubb involuntarily retreated .
melville	moby	it might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortune—and so it was , a very poor way indeed . but i am one of those that never take on about princely fortunes , and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me , while i am putting up at this grim sign of the thunder cloud . upon the whole , i thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing , but would not have been surprised had i been offered the 200th , considering i was of a broad-shouldered make .
melville	moby	nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that had achieved the ladder and the picture . its panelled front was in the likeness of a ship ’ s bluff bows , and the holy bible rested on a projecting piece of scroll work , fashioned after a ship ’ s fiddle-headed beak .
melville	moby	it will have been seen that the heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head ; and since—as has been elsewhere set forth—the head embraces one third of the whole length of the creature , then setting that length down at eighty feet for a good sized whale , you have more than twenty-six feet for the depth of the tun , when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ship ’ s side .
melville	moby	“ what will the owners say , sir ? ” “ let the owners stand on nantucket beach and outyell the typhoons . what cares ahab ? owners , owners ? thou art always prating to me , starbuck , about those miserly owners , as if the owners were my conscience . but look ye , the only real owner of anything is its commander ; and hark ye , my conscience is in this ship ’ s keel.—on deck ! ”
melville	moby	before this equatorial coin , ahab , not unobserved by others , was now pausing . “ there ’ s something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers , and all other grand and lofty things ; look here , —three peaks as proud as lucifer . the firm tower , that is ahab ; the volcano , that is ahab ; the courageous , the undaunted , and victorious fowl , that , too , is ahab ; all are ahab ; and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe , which , like a magician ’ s glass , to each and every man in turn but mirrors back his own mysterious self . great pains , small gains for those who ask the world to solve them ; it can not solve itself . methinks now this coined sun wears a ruddy face ; but see ! aye , he enters the sign of storms , the equinox ! and but six months before he wheeled out of a former equinox at aries ! from storm to storm ! so be it , then . born in throes , ’ tis fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs ! so be it , then ! here ’ s stout stuff for woe to work on . so be it , then . ”
melville	moby	first of all was queequeg , whom starbuck , the chief mate , had selected for his squire . but queequeg is already known . next was tashtego , an unmixed indian from gay head , the most westerly promontory of martha ’ s vineyard , where there still exists the last remnant of a village of red men , which has long supplied the neighboring island of nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers . in the fishery , they usually go by the generic name of gay-headers . tashtego ’ s long , lean , sable hair , his high cheek bones , and black rounding eyes—for an indian , oriental in their largeness , but antarctic in their glittering expression—all this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters , who , in quest of the great new england moose , had scoured , bow in hand , the aboriginal forests of the main . but no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland , tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea ; the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires . to look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs , you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of the earlier puritans , and half-believed this wild indian to be a son of the prince of the powers of the air . tashtego was stubb the second mate ’ s squire .
melville	moby	“ landlord , ” said i , “ tell him to stash his tomahawk there , or pipe , or whatever you call it ; tell him to stop smoking , in short , and i will turn in with him . but i don ’ t fancy having a man smoking in bed with me . it ’ s dangerous . besides , i ain ’ t insured . ”
melville	moby	the acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated at daybreak , by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and lengthwise ahead , smooth as oil , and resembling in the pleated watery wrinkles bordering it , the polished metallic-like marks of some swift tide-rip , at the mouth of a deep , rapid stream .
melville	moby	“ there go flukes ! ” was the cry , an announcement immediately followed by stubb ’ s producing his match and igniting his pipe , for now a respite was granted . after the full interval of his sounding had elapsed , the whale rose again , and being now in advance of the smoker ’ s boat , and much nearer to it than to any of the others , stubb counted upon the honor of the capture . it was obvious , now , that the whale had at length become aware of his pursuers . all silence of cautiousness was therefore no longer of use . paddles were dropped , and oars came loudly into play . and still puffing at his pipe , stubb cheered on his crew to the assault .
melville	moby	while narrating these things , every time queequeg received the tomahawk from me , he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the sleeper ’ s head . “ what ’ s that for , queequeg ? ” “ perry easy , kill-e ; oh ! perry easy ! ”
melville	moby	the first time stubb lowered with him , pip evinced much nervousness ; but happily , for that time , escaped close contact with the whale ; and therefore came off not altogether discreditably ; though stubb observing him , took care , afterwards , to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to the utmost , for he might often find it needful .
melville	moby	crossing this dusky entry , and on through yon low-arched way—cut through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with fireplaces all round—you enter the public room . a still duskier place is this , with such low ponderous beams above , and such old wrinkled planks beneath , that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft ’ s cockpits , especially of such a howling night , when this corner-anchored old ark rocked so furiously . on one side stood a long , low , shelf-like table covered with cracked glass cases , filled with dusty rarities gathered from this wide world ’ s remotest nooks . projecting from the further angle of the room stands a dark-looking den—the bar—a rude attempt at a right whale ’ s head . be that how it may , there stands the vast arched bone of the whale ’ s jaw , so wide , a coach might almost drive beneath it . within are shabby shelves , ranged round with old decanters , bottles , flasks ; and in those jaws of swift destruction , like another cursed jonah ( by which name indeed they called him ) , bustles a little withered old man , who , for their money , dearly sells the sailors deliriums and death .
melville	moby	“ then hail , for ever hail , o sea , in whose eternal tossings the wild fowl finds his only rest . born of earth , yet suckled by the sea ; though hill and valley mothered me , ye billows are my foster-brothers ! ”
melville	moby	the wind increased to a howl ; the waves dashed their bucklers together ; the whole squall roared , forked , and crackled around us like a white fire upon the prairie , in which , unconsumed , we were burning ; immortal in these jaws of death ! in vain we hailed the other boats ; as well roar to the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm . meanwhile the driving scud , rack , and mist , grew darker with the shadows of night ; no sign of the ship could be seen . the rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat . the oars were useless as propellers , performing now the office of life-preservers . so , cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg , after many failures starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern ; then stretching it on a waif pole , handed it to queequeg as the standard-bearer of this forlorn hope . there , then , he sat , holding up that imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness . there , then , he sat , the sign and symbol of a man without faith , hopelessly holding up hope in the midst of despair .
melville	moby	“ oh ! see the suds he makes ! ” cried flask , dancing up and down— “ what a hump—oh , _do_ pile on the beef—lays like a log ! oh ! my lads , _do_ spring—slap-jacks and quahogs for supper , you know , my lads—baked clams and muffins—oh , _do_ , _do_ , spring , —he ’ s a hundred barreller—don ’ t lose him now—don ’ t oh , _don ’ t ! _—see that yarman—oh , won ’ t ye pull for your duff , my lads—such a sog ! such a sogger ! don ’ t ye love sperm ? there goes three thousand dollars , men ! —a bank ! —a whole bank ! the bank of england ! —oh , _do_ , _do_ , _do ! _—what ’ s that yarman about now ? ”
melville	moby	seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the pequod ’ s boats the advantage , and rather than be thus foiled of his game , derick chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart , ere the last chance would for ever escape .
melville	moby	“ he ’ ll do , ” said bildad , eyeing me , and then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible . i thought him the queerest old quaker i ever saw , especially as peleg , his friend and old shipmate , seemed such a blusterer . but i said nothing , only looking round me sharply . peleg now threw open a chest , and drawing forth the ship ’ s articles , placed pen and ink before him , and seated himself at a little table . i began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms i would be willing to engage for the voyage . i was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages ; but all hands , including the captain , received certain shares of the profits called _lays_ , and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship ’ s company . i was also aware that being a green hand at whaling , my own lay would not be very large ; but considering that i was used to the sea , could steer a ship , splice a rope , and all that , i made no doubt that from all i had heard i should be offered at least the 275th lay—that is , the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage , whatever that might eventually amount to . and though the 275th lay was what they call a rather _long lay_ , yet it was better than nothing ; and if we had a lucky voyage , might pretty nearly pay for the clothing i would wear out on it , not to speak of my three years ’ beef and board , for which i would not have to pay one stiver .
melville	moby	there seems some ground to imagine that the great kraken of bishop pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into squid . the manner in which the bishop describes it , as alternately rising and sinking , with some other particulars he narrates , in all this the two correspond . but much abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he assigns it .
melville	moby	we had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time , when all at once i thought i would open my eyes ; for when between sheets , whether by day or by night , and whether asleep or awake , i have a way of always keeping my eyes shut , in order the more to concentrate the snugness of being in bed . because no man can ever feel his own identity aright except his eyes be closed ; as if darkness were indeed the proper element of our essences , though light be more congenial to our clayey part . upon opening my eyes then , and coming out of my own pleasant and self-created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated twelve-o ’ clock-at-night , i experienced a disagreeable revulsion . nor did i at all object to the hint from queequeg that perhaps it were best to strike a light , seeing that we were so wide awake ; and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his tomahawk . be it said , that though i had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before , yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them . for now i liked nothing better than to have queequeg smoking by me , even in bed , because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy then . i no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord ’ s policy of insurance . i was only alive to the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend . with our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders , we now passed the tomahawk from one to the other , till slowly there grew over us a blue hanging tester of smoke , illuminated by the flame of the new-lit lamp .
melville	moby	“ man my boat ! ” cried ahab , impetuously , and tossing about the oars near him— “ stand by to lower ! ” in less than a minute , without quitting his little craft , he and his crew were dropped to the water , and were soon alongside of the stranger . but here a curious difficulty presented itself . in the excitement of the moment , ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own , and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to the pequod , and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moment ’ s warning . now , it is no very easy matter for anybody—except those who are almost hourly used to it , like whalemen—to clamber up a ship ’ s side from a boat on the open sea ; for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks , and then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson . so , deprived of one leg , and the strange ship of course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention , ahab now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again ; hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope to attain .
melville	moby	but no more ; enough has been said to show that the old dutch whalers of two or three centuries ago were high livers ; and that the english whalers have not neglected so excellent an example . for , say they , when cruising in an empty ship , if you can get nothing better out of the world , get a good dinner out of it , at least . and this empties the decanter .
melville	moby	next morning the not-yet-subsided sea rolled in long slow billows of mighty bulk , and striving in the pequod ’ s gurgling track , pushed her on like giants ’ palms outspread . the strong , unstaggering breeze abounded so , that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails ; the whole world boomed before the wind . muffled in the full morning light , the invisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place ; where his bayonet rays moved on in stacks . emblazonings , as of crowned babylonian kings and queens , reigned over everything . the sea was as a crucible of molten gold , that bubblingly leaps with light and heat .
melville	moby	instantly the yards were squared , to the lively song of “ _ho ! the fair wind ! oh-ye-ho , cheerly men ! _ ” the crew singing for joy , that so promising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents preceding it .
melville	moby	out of the trunk , the branches grow ; out of them , the twigs . so , in productive subjects , grow the chapters . the crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention . it is a notched stick of a peculiar form , some two feet in length , which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow , for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the harpoon , whose other naked , barbed end slopingly projects from the prow . thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler , who snatches it up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall . it is customary to have two harpoons reposing in the crotch , respectively called the first and second irons .
melville	moby	when the last echo of his sultan ’ s step has died away , and starbuck , the first emir , has every reason to suppose that he is seated , then starbuck rouses from his quietude , takes a few turns along the planks , and , after a grave peep into the binnacle , says , with some touch of pleasantness , “ dinner , mr. stubb , ” and descends the scuttle . the second emir lounges about the rigging awhile , and then slightly shaking the main brace , to see whether it will be all right with that important rope , he likewise takes up the old burden , and with a rapid “ dinner , mr. flask , ” follows after his predecessors .

melville	moby	it was now clear sunrise . soon the crew came on board in twos and threes ; the riggers bestirred themselves ; the mates were actively engaged ; and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various last things on board . meanwhile captain ahab remained invisibly enshrined within his cabin .
melville	moby	there is no life in thee , now , except that rocking life imparted by a gently rolling ship ; by her , borrowed from the sea ; by the sea , from the inscrutable tides of god . but while this sleep , this dream is on ye , move your foot or hand an inch ; slip your hold at all ; and your identity comes back in horror . over descartian vortices you hover . and perhaps , at mid-day , in the fairest weather , with one half-throttled shriek you drop through that transparent air into the summer sea , no more to rise for ever . heed it well , ye pantheists !
melville	moby	and , as for me , if , by any possibility , there be any as yet undiscovered prime thing in me ; if i shall ever deserve any real repute in that small but high hushed world which i might not be unreasonably ambitious of ; if hereafter i shall do anything that , upon the whole , a man might rather have done than to have left undone ; if , at my death , my executors , or more properly my creditors , find any precious mss . in my desk , then here i prospectively ascribe all the honor and the glory to whaling ; for a whale-ship was my yale college and my harvard .
melville	moby	now , as the business of standing mast-heads , ashore or afloat , is a very ancient and interesting one , let us in some measure expatiate here . i take it , that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old egyptians ; because , in all my researches , i find none prior to them . for though their progenitors , the builders of babel , must doubtless , by their tower , have intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all asia , or africa either ; yet ( ere the final truck was put to it ) as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board , in the dread gale of god ’ s wrath ; therefore , we can not give these babel builders priority over the egyptians . and that the egyptians were a nation of mast-head standers , is an assertion based upon the general belief among archæologists , that the first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes : a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stair-like formation of all four sides of those edifices ; whereby , with prodigious long upliftings of their legs , those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex , and sing out for new stars ; even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail , or a whale just bearing in sight . in saint stylites , the famous christian hermit of old times , who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life on its summit , hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle ; in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless stander-of-mast-heads ; who was not to be driven from his place by fogs or frosts , rain , hail , or sleet ; but valiantly facing everything out to the last , literally died at his post . of modern standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set ; mere stone , iron , and bronze men ; who , though well capable of facing out a stiff gale , are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange sight . there is napoleon ; who , upon the top of the column of vendome , stands with arms folded , some one hundred and fifty feet in the air ; careless , now , who rules the decks below ; whether louis philippe , louis blanc , or louis the devil . great washington , too , stands high aloft on his towering main-mast in baltimore , and like one of hercules ’ pillars , his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go . admiral nelson , also , on a capstan of gun-metal , stands his mast-head in trafalgar square ; and ever when most obscured by that london smoke , token is yet given that a hidden hero is there ; for where there is smoke , must be fire . but neither great washington , nor napoleon , nor nelson , will answer a single hail from below , however madly invoked to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze ; however it may be surmised , that their spirits penetrate through the thick haze of the future , and descry what shoals and what rocks must be shunned .
melville	moby	but though thus contrasting within , the contrast was only in shades and shadows without ; those two seemed one ; it was only the sex , as it were , that distinguished them . aloft , like a royal czar and king , the sun seemed giving this gentle air to this bold and rolling sea ; even as bride to groom . and at the girdling line of the horizon , a soft and tremulous motion—most seen here at the equator—denoted the fond , throbbing trust , the loving alarms , with which the poor bride gave her bosom away .
melville	moby	but thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew ; and when , after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern , the pequod at last shot by the vivid green cockatoo point on the sumatra side , emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond ; then , the harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been gaining upon the ship , than to rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gained upon the malays . but still driving on in the wake of the whales , at length they seemed abating their speed ; gradually the ship neared them ; and the wind now dying away , word was passed to spring to the boats . but no sooner did the herd , by some presumed wonderful instinct of the sperm whale , become notified of the three keels that were after them , —though as yet a mile in their rear , —than they rallied again , and forming in close ranks and battalions , so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked bayonets , moved on with redoubled velocity .

melville	moby	it is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment . then , in darting at the monster , knife in hand , he had but given loose to a sudden , passionate , corporal animosity ; and when he received the stroke that tore him , he probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration , but nothing more . yet , when by this collision forced to turn towards home , and for long months of days and weeks , ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one hammock , rounding in mid winter that dreary , howling patagonian cape ; then it was , that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another ; and so interfusing , made him mad . that it was only then , on the homeward voyage , after the encounter , that the final monomania seized him , seems all but certain from the fact that , at intervals during the passage , he was a raving lunatic ; and , though unlimbed of a leg , yet such vital strength yet lurked in his egyptian chest , and was moreover intensified by his delirium , that his mates were forced to lace him fast , even there , as he sailed , raving in his hammock . in a strait-jacket , he swung to the mad rockings of the gales . and , when running into more sufferable latitudes , the ship , with mild stun ’ sails spread , floated across the tranquil tropics , and , to all appearances , the old man ’ s delirium seemed left behind him with the cape horn swells , and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and air ; even then , when he bore that firm , collected front , however pale , and issued his calm orders once again ; and his mates thanked god the direful madness was now gone ; even then , ahab , in his hidden self , raved on . human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing . when you think it fled , it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler form . ahab ’ s full lunacy subsided not , but deepeningly contracted ; like the unabated hudson , when that noble northman flows narrowly , but unfathomably through the highland gorge . but , as in his narrow-flowing monomania , not one jot of ahab ’ s broad madness had been left behind ; so in that broad madness , not one jot of his great natural intellect had perished . that before living agent , now became the living instrument . if such a furious trope may stand , his special lunacy stormed his general sanity , and carried it , and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark ; so that far from having lost his strength , ahab , to that one end , did now possess a thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one reasonable object .
melville	moby	in the case of a small sperm whale the brains are accounted a fine dish . the casket of the skull is broken into with an axe , and the two plump , whitish lobes being withdrawn ( precisely resembling two large puddings ) , they are then mixed with flour , and cooked into a most delectable mess , in flavor somewhat resembling calves ’ head , which is quite a dish among some epicures ; and every one knows that some young bucks among the epicures , by continually dining upon calves ’ brains , by and by get to have a little brains of their own , so as to be able to tell a calf ’ s head from their own heads ; which , indeed , requires uncommon discrimination . and that is the reason why a young buck with an intelligent looking calf ’ s head before him , is somehow one of the saddest sights you can see . the head looks a sort of reproachfully at him , with an “ et tu brute ! ” expression .

melville	moby	by this time the faint air had become a complete calm ; so that whether or no , the pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell , with no hope of escaping except by its breezing up again . issuing from the cabin , stubb now called his boat ’ s crew , and pulled off for the stranger . drawing across her bow , he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful french taste , the upper part of her stem-piece was carved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk , was painted green , and for thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there ; the whole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour . upon her head boards , in large gilt letters , he read “ bouton de rose , ” —rose-button , or rose-bud ; and this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship .
melville	moby	at that preluding moment , ere the boat was yet snapped , ahab , the first to perceive the whale ’ s intent , by the crafty upraising of his head , a movement that loosed his hold for the time ; at that moment his hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite . but only slipping further into the whale ’ s mouth , and tilting over sideways as it slipped , the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw ; spilled him out of it , as he leaned to the push ; and so he fell flat-faced upon the sea .

melville	moby	lionel , it seems , was on his way to “ john ferdinando , ” as he calls the modern juan fernandes . “ in our way thither , ” he says , “ about four o ’ clock in the morning , when we were about one hundred and fifty leagues from the main of america , our ship felt a terrible shock , which put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where they were or what to think ; but every one began to prepare for death . and , indeed , the shock was so sudden and violent , that we took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock ; but when the amazement was a little over , we cast the lead , and sounded , but found no ground . * * * * * the suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their carriages , and several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks . captain davis , who lay with his head on a gun , was thrown out of his cabin ! ” lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake , and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a great earthquake , somewhere about that time , did actually do great mischief along the spanish land . but i should not much wonder if , in the darkness of that early hour of the morning , the shock was after all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath .
melville	moby	“ there she blows—she blows ! —she blows ! —right ahead ! ” was now the mast-head cry . “ aye , aye ! ” cried stubb , “ i knew it—ye can ’ t escape—blow on and split your spout , o whale ! the mad fiend himself is after ye ! blow your trump—blister your lungs ! —ahab will dam off your blood , as a miller shuts his watergate upon the stream ! ”
melville	moby	it has before been hinted , perhaps , that every little untoward circumstance that befell him , and which indirectly sprang from his luckless mishap , almost invariably irritated or exasperated ahab . and in the present instance , all this was heightened by the sight of the two officers of the strange ship , leaning over the side , by the perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there , and swinging towards him a pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes ; for at first they did not seem to bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to use their sea bannisters . but this awkwardness only lasted a minute , because the strange captain , observing at a glance how affairs stood , cried out , “ i see , i see ! —avast heaving there ! jump , boys , and swing over the cutting-tackle . ”
melville	moby	nor , at any time , by night or day could the mariners now step upon the deck , unless ahab was before them ; either standing in his pivot-hole , or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits , —the main-mast and the mizen ; or else they saw him standing in the cabin-scuttle , —his living foot advanced upon the deck , as if to step ; his hat slouched heavily over his eyes ; so that however motionless he stood , however the days and nights were added on , that he had not swung in his hammock ; yet hidden beneath that slouching hat , they could never tell unerringly whether , for all this , his eyes were really closed at times ; or whether he was still intently scanning them ; no matter , though he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch , and the unheeded night-damp gathered in beads of dew upon that stone-carved coat and hat . the clothes that the night had wet , the next day ’ s sunshine dried upon him ; and so , day after day , and night after night ; he went no more beneath the planks ; whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for .
melville	moby	“ the measure ! the measure ! ” cried ahab . receiving the brimming pewter , and turning to the harpooneers , he ordered them to produce their weapons . then ranging them before him near the capstan , with their harpoons in their hands , while his three mates stood at his side with their lances , and the rest of the ship ’ s company formed a circle round the group ; he stood for an instant searchingly eyeing every man of his crew . but those wild eyes met his , as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their leader , ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison ; but , alas ! only to fall into the hidden snare of the indian .

melville	moby	nor is this the end . desecrated as the body is , a vengeful ghost survives and hovers over it to scare . espied by some timid man-of-war or blundering discovery-vessel from afar , when the distance obscuring the swarming fowls , nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in the sun , and the white spray heaving high against it ; straightway the whale ’ s unharming corpse , with trembling fingers is set down in the log—_shoals , rocks , and breakers hereabouts : beware ! _ and for years afterwards , perhaps , ships shun the place ; leaping over it as silly sheep leap over a vacuum , because their leader originally leaped there when a stick was held . there ’ s your law of precedents ; there ’ s your utility of traditions ; there ’ s the story of your obstinate survival of old beliefs never bottomed on the earth , and now not even hovering in the air ! there ’ s orthodoxy !
melville	moby	unwittingly here a secret has been divulged , which perhaps might more properly , in set way , have been disclosed before . with many other particulars concerning ahab , always had it remained a mystery to some , why it was , that for a certain period , both before and after the sailing of the pequod , he had hidden himself away with such grand-lama-like exclusiveness ; and , for that one interval , sought speechless refuge , as it were , among the marble senate of the dead . captain peleg ’ s bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means adequate ; though , indeed , as touching all ahab ’ s deeper part , every revelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory light . but , in the end , it all came out ; this one matter did , at least . that direful mishap was at the bottom of his temporary recluseness . and not only this , but to that ever-contracting , dropping circle ashore , who , for any reason , possessed the privilege of a less banned approach to him ; to that timid circle the above hinted casualty—remaining , as it did , moodily unaccounted for by ahab—invested itself with terrors , not entirely underived from the land of spirits and of wails . so that , through their zeal for him , they had all conspired , so far as in them lay , to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others ; and hence it was , that not till a considerable interval had elapsed , did it transpire upon the pequod ’ s decks .
melville	moby	but somehow i dropped off at last , and knew nothing more till break of day ; when , looking over the bedside , there squatted queequeg , as if he had been screwed down to the floor . but as soon as the first glimpse of sun entered the window , up he got , with stiff and grating joints , but with a cheerful look ; limped towards me where i lay ; pressed his forehead again against mine ; and said his ramadan was over .
melville	moby	“ those sailors we saw , queequeg , where can they have gone to ? ” said i , looking dubiously at the sleeper . but it seemed that , when on the wharf , queequeg had not at all noticed what i now alluded to ; hence i would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter , were it not for elijah ’ s otherwise inexplicable question . but i beat the thing down ; and again marking the sleeper , jocularly hinted to queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body ; telling him to establish himself accordingly . he put his hand upon the sleeper ’ s rear , as though feeling if it was soft enough ; and then , without more ado , sat quietly down there .
melville	moby	now , take away the awful fear , and my sensations at feeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar , in their strangeness , to those which i experienced on waking up and seeing queequeg ’ s pagan arm thrown round me . but at length all the past night ’ s events soberly recurred , one by one , in fixed reality , and then i lay only alive to the comical predicament . for though i tried to move his arm—unlock his bridegroom clasp—yet , sleeping as he was , he still hugged me tightly , as though naught but death should part us twain . i now strove to rouse him— “ queequeg ! ” —but his only answer was a snore . i then rolled over , my neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar ; and suddenly felt a slight scratch . throwing aside the counterpane , there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage ’ s side , as if it were a hatchet-faced baby . a pretty pickle , truly , thought i ; abed here in a strange house in the broad day , with a cannibal and a tomahawk ! “ queequeg ! —in the name of goodness , queequeg , wake ! ” at length , by dint of much wriggling , and loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style , i succeeded in extracting a grunt ; and presently , he drew back his arm , shook himself all over like a newfoundland dog just from the water , and sat up in bed , stiff as a pike-staff , looking at me , and rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether remember how i came to be there , though a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him . meanwhile , i lay quietly eyeing him , having no serious misgivings now , and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature . when , at last , his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow , and he became , as it were , reconciled to the fact ; he jumped out upon the floor , and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that , if it pleased me , he would dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards , leaving the whole apartment to myself . thinks i , queequeg , under the circumstances , this is a very civilized overture ; but , the truth is , these savages have an innate sense of delicacy , say what you will ; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are . i pay this particular compliment to queequeg , because he treated me with so much civility and consideration , while i was guilty of great rudeness ; staring at him from the bed , and watching all his toilette motions ; for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding . nevertheless , a man like queequeg you don ’ t see every day , he and his ways were well worth unusual regarding .
melville	moby	“ what d ’ ye see ? ” cried ahab , flattening his face to the sky . “ nothing , nothing sir ! ” was the sound hailing down in reply . “ t ’ gallant sails ! —stunsails ! alow and aloft , and on both sides ! ”
melville	moby	it is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens , even modern ones , a certain curious process of seasoning them for their functions is gone through . there is a saltcellar of state , so called , and there may be a castor of state . how they use the salt , precisely—who knows ? certain i am , however , that a king ’ s head is solemnly oiled at his coronation , even as a head of salad . can it be , though , that they anoint it with a view of making its interior run well , as they anoint machinery ? much might be ruminated here , concerning the essential dignity of this regal process , because in common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair , and palpably smells of that anointing . in truth , a mature man who uses hair-oil , unless medicinally , that man has probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere . as a general rule , he can ’ t amount to much in his totality .
melville	moby	* in sperm-whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board , it is a regular semi-weekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold , and drench the casks with sea-water ; which afterwards , at varying intervals , is removed by the ship ’ s pumps . hereby the casks are sought to be kept damply tight ; while by the changed character of the withdrawn water , the mariners readily detect any serious leakage in the precious cargo .
melville	moby	meantime , ahab holding the letter , muttered , “ mr . har—yes , mr. harry— ( a woman ’ s pinny hand , —the man ’ s wife , i ’ ll wager ) —aye—mr . harry macey , ship jeroboam ; —why it ’ s macey , and he ’ s dead ! ” “ poor fellow ! poor fellow ! and from his wife , ” sighed mayhew ; “ but let me have it . ”
melville	moby	“ bress my soul , if i cook noder one , ” he growled , angrily , turning round to depart . “ come back , cook ; —here , hand me those tongs ; —now take that bit of steak there , and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it should be ? take it , i say ” —holding the tongs towards him— “ take it , and taste it . ”
melville	moby	towards evening , when i felt assured that all his performances and rituals must be over , i went up to his room and knocked at the door ; but no answer . i tried to open it , but it was fastened inside . “ queequeg , ” said i softly through the key-hole : —all silent . “ i say , queequeg ! why don ’ t you speak ? it ’ s i—ishmael. ” but all remained still as before . i began to grow alarmed . i had allowed him such abundant time ; i thought he might have had an apoplectic fit . i looked through the key-hole ; but the door opening into an odd corner of the room , the key-hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one . i could only see part of the foot-board of the bed and a line of the wall , but nothing more . i was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of queequeg ’ s harpoon , which the landlady the evening previous had taken from him , before our mounting to the chamber . that ’ s strange , thought i ; but at any rate , since the harpoon stands yonder , and he seldom or never goes abroad without it , therefore he must be inside here , and no possible mistake .
melville	moby	chapter 133 . the chase—first day . that night , in the mid-watch , when the old man—as his wont at intervals—stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned , and went to his pivot-hole , he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely , snuffing up the sea air as a sagacious ship ’ s dog will , in drawing nigh to some barbarous isle . he declared that a whale must be near . soon that peculiar odor , sometimes to a great distance given forth by the living sperm whale , was palpable to all the watch ; nor was any mariner surprised when , after inspecting the compass , and then the dog-vane , and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as possible , ahab rapidly ordered the ship ’ s course to be slightly altered , and the sail to be shortened .
melville	moby	but ere this was done , pip , who had been slily hovering near by all this while , drew nigh to him where he lay , and with soft sobbings , took him by the hand ; in the other , holding his tambourine .
melville	moby	and just so i now did with queequeg . “ queequeg , ” said i , “ get into bed now , and lie and listen to me. ” i then went on , beginning with the rise and progress of the primitive religions , and coming down to the various religions of the present time , during which time i labored to show queequeg that all these lents , ramadans , and prolonged ham-squattings in cold , cheerless rooms were stark nonsense ; bad for the health ; useless for the soul ; opposed , in short , to the obvious laws of hygiene and common sense . i told him , too , that he being in other things such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage , it pained me , very badly pained me , to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous ramadan of his . besides , argued i , fasting makes the body cave in ; hence the spirit caves in ; and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half-starved . this is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters . in one word , queequeg , said i , rather digressively ; hell is an idea first born on an undigested apple-dumpling ; and since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by ramadans .

melville	moby	i then asked queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with dyspepsia ; expressing the idea very plainly , so that he could take it in . he said no ; only upon one memorable occasion . it was after a great feast given by his father the king , on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o ’ clock in the afternoon , and all cooked and eaten that very evening .
melville	moby	the lost life-buoy was now to be replaced ; starbuck was directed to see to it ; but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found , and as in the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the voyage , all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly connected with its final end , whatever that might prove to be ; therefore , they were going to leave the ship ’ s stern unprovided with a buoy , when by certain strange signs and inuendoes queequeg hinted a hint concerning his coffin .
melville	moby	the long-drawn virgin vales ; the mild blue hill-sides ; as over these there steals the hush , the hum ; you almost swear that play-wearied children lie sleeping in these solitudes , in some glad may-time , when the flowers of the woods are plucked . and all this mixes with your most mystic mood ; so that fact and fancy , half-way meeting , interpenetrate , and form one seamless whole .
melville	moby	“ that drove the spigot out of him ! ” cried stubb . “ ’ tis july ’ s immortal fourth ; all fountains must run wine today ! would now , it were old orleans whiskey , or old ohio , or unspeakable old monongahela ! then , tashtego , lad , i ’ d have ye hold a canakin to the jet , and we ’ d drink round it ! yea , verily , hearts alive , we ’ d brew choice punch in the spread of his spout-hole there , and from that live punch-bowl quaff the living stuff . ”
melville	moby	caught and twisted—corkscrewed in the mazes of the line , loose harpoons and lances , with all their bristling barbs and points , came flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of ahab ’ s boat . only one thing could be done . seizing the boat-knife , he critically reached within—through—and then , without—the rays of steel ; dragged in the line beyond , passed it , inboard , to the bowsman , and then , twice sundering the rope near the chocks—dropped the intercepted fagot of steel into the sea ; and was all fast again . that instant , the white whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines ; by so doing , irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of stubb and flask towards his flukes ; dashed them together like two rolling husks on a surf-beaten beach , and then , diving down into the sea , disappeared in a boiling maelstrom , in which , for a space , the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced round and round , like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of punch .
melville	moby	some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover litigated in england , wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of a whale in the northern seas ; and when indeed they ( the plaintiffs ) had succeeded in harpooning the fish ; they were at last , through peril of their lives , obliged to forsake not only their lines , but their boat itself . ultimately the defendants ( the crew of another ship ) came up with the whale , struck , killed , seized , and finally appropriated it before the very eyes of the plaintiffs . and when those defendants were remonstrated with , their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs ’ teeth , and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had done , he would now retain their line , harpoons , and boat , which had remained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure . wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale , line , harpoons , and boat .
melville	moby	but he looked too nigh the boat ; for as if bent upon escaping with the corpse he bore , and as if the particular place of the last encounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage , moby dick was now again steadily swimming forward ; and had almost passed the ship , —which thus far had been sailing in the contrary direction to him , though for the present her headway had been stopped . he seemed swimming with his utmost velocity , and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the sea .
melville	moby	* the cabin-compass is called the tell-tale , because without going to the compass at the helm , the captain , while below , can inform himself of the course of the ship . terrible old man ! thought starbuck with a shudder , sleeping in this gale , still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose .
melville	moby	the rest of his body was so streaked , and spotted , and marbled with the same shrouded hue , that , in the end , he had gained his distinctive appellation of the white whale ; a name , indeed , literally justified by his vivid aspect , when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea , leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam , all spangled with golden gleamings .
melville	moby	“ ‘ nay , senor ; hereabouts in this dull , warm , most lazy , and hereditary land , we know but little of your vigorous north. ’ “ ‘ aye ? well then , don , refill my cup . your chicha ’ s very fine ; and ere proceeding further i will tell ye what our canallers are ; for such information may throw side-light upon my story . ’
melville	moby	when dusk descended , the whale was still in sight to leeward . so once more the sail was shortened , and everything passed nearly as on the previous night ; only , the sound of hammers , and the hum of the grindstone was heard till nearly daylight , as the men toiled by lanterns in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and sharpening their fresh weapons for the morrow . meantime , of the broken keel of ahab ’ s wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg ; while still as on the night before , slouched ahab stood fixed within his scuttle ; his hid , heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its dial ; sat due eastward for the earliest sun .
melville	moby	“ my song for ever shall record that terrible , that joyful hour ; i give the glory to my god , his all the mercy and the power. ” nearly all joined in singing this hymn , which swelled high above the howling of the storm . a brief pause ensued ; the preacher slowly turned over the leaves of the bible , and at last , folding his hand down upon the proper page , said : “ beloved shipmates , clinch the last verse of the first chapter of jonah— ‘ and god had prepared a great fish to swallow up jonah . ’ ”

melville	moby	now , to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans , it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet . but not so did it seem to ahab , who knew the sets of all tides and currents ; and thereby calculating the driftings of the sperm whale ’ s food ; and , also , calling to mind the regular , ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular latitudes ; could arrive at reasonable surmises , almost approaching to certainties , concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that ground in search of his prey .
melville	moby	a common man looking at this decision of the very learned judge , might possibly object to it . but ploughed up to the primary rock of the matter , the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws previously quoted , and applied and elucidated by lord ellenborough in the above cited case ; these two laws touching fast-fish and loose-fish , i say , will , on reflection , be found the fundamentals of all human jurisprudence ; for notwithstanding its complicated tracery of sculpture , the temple of the law , like the temple of the philistines , has but two props to stand on .
melville	moby	his necessities supplied , derick departed ; but he had not gained his ship ’ s side , when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the mast-heads of both vessels ; and so eager for the chase was derick , that without pausing to put his oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard , he slewed round his boat and made after the leviathan lamp-feeders .

melville	moby	in man , breathing is incessantly going on—one breath only serving for two or three pulsations ; so that whatever other business he has to attend to , waking or sleeping , breathe he must , or die he will . but the sperm whale only breathes about one seventh or sunday of his time .
melville	moby	the line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp , slightly vapored with tar , not impregnated with it , as in the case of ordinary ropes ; for while tar , as ordinarily used , makes the hemp more pliable to the rope-maker , and also renders the rope itself more convenient to the sailor for common ship use ; yet , not only would the ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whale-line for the close coiling to which it must be subjected ; but as most seamen are beginning to learn , tar in general by no means adds to the rope ’ s durability or strength , however much it may give it compactness and gloss .
melville	moby	another point of difference between the male and female schools is still more characteristic of the sexes . say you strike a forty-barrel-bull—poor devil ! all his comrades quit him . but strike a member of the harem school , and her companions swim around her with every token of concern , sometimes lingering so near her and so long , as themselves to fall a prey .

melville	moby	what other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet there is no telling . but a sudden stop was put to further discoveries , by the ship ’ s being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways to the sea , owing to the body ’ s immensely increasing tendency to sink . however , starbuck , who had the ordering of affairs , hung on to it to the last ; hung on to it so resolutely , indeed , that when at length the ship would have been capsized , if still persisting in locking arms with the body ; then , when the command was given to break clear from it , such was the immovable strain upon the timber-heads to which the fluke-chains and cables were fastened , that it was impossible to cast them off . meantime everything in the pequod was aslant . to cross to the other side of the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house . the ship groaned and gasped . many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started from their places , by the unnatural dislocation . in vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the immovable fluke-chains , to pry them adrift from the timberheads ; and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all approached , while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk , and the ship seemed on the point of going over .
melville	moby	but still another inquiry remains ; one often agitated by the more recondite nantucketers . whether owing to the almost omniscient look-outs at the mast-heads of the whale-ships , now penetrating even through behring ’ s straits , and into the remotest secret drawers and lockers of the world ; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along all continental coasts ; the moot point is , whether leviathan can long endure so wide a chase , and so remorseless a havoc ; whether he must not at last be exterminated from the waters , and the last whale , like the last man , smoke his last pipe , and then himself evaporate in the final puff .
melville	moby	but not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it , but it is also a fiend to its own off-spring ; worse than the persian host who murdered his own guests ; sparing not the creatures which itself hath spawned . like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own cubs , so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks , and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships . no mercy , no power but its own controls it . panting and snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider , the masterless ocean overruns the globe .
melville	moby	now , i care not who maintains the contrary , but all this is both foolish and unnecessary . the headsman should stay in the bows from first to last ; he should both dart the harpoon and the lance , and no rowing whatever should be expected of him , except under circumstances obvious to any fisherman . i know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss of speed in the chase ; but long experience in various whalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast majority of failures in the fishery , it has not by any means been so much the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the harpooneer that has caused them .
melville	moby	but what is this on the chest ? i took it up , and held it close to the light , and felt it , and smelt it , and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it . i can compare it to nothing but a large door mat , ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an indian moccasin . there was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat , as you see the same in south american ponchos . but could it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat , and parade the streets of any christian town in that sort of guise ? i put it on , to try it , and it weighed me down like a hamper , being uncommonly shaggy and thick , and i thought a little damp , as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day . i went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall , and i never saw such a sight in my life . i tore myself out of it in such a hurry that i gave myself a kink in the neck .

melville	moby	it had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons , were it not that as we advanced into the herd , our whale ’ s way greatly diminished ; moreover , that as we went still further and further from the circumference of commotion , the direful disorders seemed waning . so that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out , and the towing whale sideways vanished ; then , with the tapering force of his parting momentum , we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal , as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake . here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales , were heard but not felt . in this central expanse the sea presented that smooth satin-like surface , called a sleek , produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods . yes , we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart of every commotion . and still in the distracted distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles , and saw successive pods of whales , eight or ten in each , swiftly going round and round , like multiplied spans of horses in a ring ; and so closely shoulder to shoulder , that a titanic circus-rider might easily have over-arched the middle ones , and so have gone round on their backs . owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whales , more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd , no possible chance of escape was at present afforded us . we must watch for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in ; the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us up . keeping at the centre of the lake , we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves ; the women and children of this routed host .
melville	moby	seeing , now , that there were no curtains to the window , and that the street being very narrow , the house opposite commanded a plain view into the room , and observing more and more the indecorous figure that queequeg made , staving about with little else but his hat and boots on ; i begged him as well as i could , to accelerate his toilet somewhat , and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible . he complied , and then proceeded to wash himself . at that time in the morning any christian would have washed his face ; but queequeg , to my amazement , contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his chest , arms , and hands . he then donned his waistcoat , and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash-stand centre table , dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face . i was watching to see where he kept his razor , when lo and behold , he takes the harpoon from the bed corner , slips out the long wooden stock , unsheathes the head , whets it a little on his boot , and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall , begins a vigorous scraping , or rather harpooning of his cheeks . thinks i , queequeg , this is using rogers ’ s best cutlery with a vengeance . afterwards i wondered the less at this operation when i came to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made , and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept .
melville	moby	but these two harpoons , each by its own cord , are both connected with the line ; the object being this : to dart them both , if possible , one instantly after the other into the same whale ; so that if , in the coming drag , one should draw out , the other may still retain a hold . it is a doubling of the chances . but it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous , violent , convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron , it becomes impossible for the harpooneer , however lightning-like in his movements , to pitch the second iron into him . nevertheless , as the second iron is already connected with the line , and the line is running , hence that weapon must , at all events , be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat , somehow and somewhere ; else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands . tumbled into the water , it accordingly is in such cases ; the spare coils of box line ( mentioned in a preceding chapter ) making this feat , in most instances , prudently practicable . but this critical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal casualties .
melville	moby	thrusting his head half way into the binnacle , ahab caught one glimpse of the compasses ; his uplifted arm slowly fell ; for a moment he almost seemed to stagger . standing behind him starbuck looked , and lo ! the two compasses pointed east , and the pequod was as infallibly going west .
melville	moby	most famous in our western annals and indian traditions is that of the white steed of the prairies ; a magnificent milk-white charger , large-eyed , small-headed , bluff-chested , and with the dignity of a thousand monarchs in his lofty , overscorning carriage . he was the elected xerxes of vast herds of wild horses , whose pastures in those days were only fenced by the rocky mountains and the alleghanies . at their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which every evening leads on the hosts of light . the flashing cascade of his mane , the curving comet of his tail , invested him with housings more resplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnished him . a most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen , western world , which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the glories of those primeval times when adam walked majestic as a god , bluff-browed and fearless as this mighty steed . whether marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly streamed it over the plains , like an ohio ; or whether with his circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon , the white steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through his cool milkiness ; in whatever aspect he presented himself , always to the bravest indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe . nor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble horse , that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly , which so clothed him with divineness ; and that this divineness had that in it which , though commanding worship , at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror .
melville	moby	what could be more full of meaning ? —for the pulpit is ever this earth ’ s foremost part ; all the rest comes in its rear ; the pulpit leads the world . from thence it is the storm of god ’ s quick wrath is first descried , and the bow must bear the earliest brunt . from thence it is the god of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds . yes , the world ’ s a ship on its passage out , and not a voyage complete ; and the pulpit is its prow .
melville	moby	“ hear him , hear him now , ” cried peleg , marching across the cabin , and thrusting his hands far down into his pockets , — “ hear him , all of ye . think of that ! when every moment we thought the ship would sink ! death and the judgment then ? what ? with all three masts making such an everlasting thundering against the side ; and every sea breaking over us , fore and aft . think of death and the judgment then ? no ! no time to think about death then . life was what captain ahab and i was thinking of ; and how to save all hands—how to rig jury-masts—how to get into the nearest port ; that was what i was thinking of . ”
melville	typee	in fact religious affairs in typee were at a very low ebb : all such matters sat very lightly upon the thoughtless inhabitants ; and , in the celebration of many of their strange rites , they appeared merely to seek a sort of childish amusement .
melville	typee	a curious evidence of this was given in a remarkable ceremony in which i frequently saw mehevi and several other chefs and warriors of note take part ; but never a single female .
melville	typee	among those whom i looked upon as forming the priesthood of the valley , there was one in particular who often attracted my notice , and whom i could not help regarding as the head of the order . he was a noble looking man , in the prime of his life , and of a most benignant aspect . the authority this man , whose name was kolory , seemed to exercise over the rest , the episcopal part he took in the feast of calabashes , his sleek and complacent appearance , the mystic characters which were tattooed upon his chest , and above all the mitre he frequently wore , in the shape of a towering head-dress , consisting of part of a cocoanut branch , the stalk planted uprightly on his brow , and the leaflets gathered together and passed round the temples and behind the ears , all these pointed him out as lord primate of typee . kolory was a sort of knight templar -- a soldier-priest ; for he often wore the dress of a marquesan warrior , and always carried a long spear , which , instead of terminating in a paddle at the lower end , after the general fashion of these weapons , was curved into a heathenish-looking little image . this instrument , however , might perhaps have been emblematic of his double functions . with one end in carnal combat he transfixed the enemies of his tribe ; and with the other as a pastoral crook he kept in order his spiritual flock . but this is not all i have to say about kolory .
melville	typee	his martial grace very often carried about with him what seemed to me the half of a broken war-club . it was swathed round with ragged bits of white tappa , and the upper part , which was intended to represent a human head , was embellished with a strip of scarlet cloth of european manufacture . it required little observation to discover that this strange object was revered as a god . by the side of the big and lusty images standing sentinel over the altars of the hoolah hoolah ground , it seemed a mere pigmy in tatters . but appearances all the world over are deceptive . little men are sometimes very potent , and rags sometimes cover very extensive pretensions . in fact , this funny little image was the ‘ crack ’ god of the island ; lording it over all the wooden lubbers who looked so grim and dreadful ; its name was moa artua * . and it was in honour of moa artua , and for the entertainment of those who believe in him , that the curious ceremony i am about to describe was observed .
melville	typee	* the word ‘ artua ’ , although having some other significations , is in nearly all the polynesian dialects used as the general designation of the gods . mehevi and the chieftains of the ti have just risen from their noontide slumbers . there are no affairs of state to dispose of ; and having eaten two or three breakfasts in the course of the morning , the magnates of the valley feel no appetite as yet for dinner . how are their leisure moments to be occupied ? they smoke , they chat , and at last one of their number makes a proposition to the rest , who joyfully acquiescing , he darts out of the house , leaps from the pi-pi , and disappears in the grove . soon you see him returning with kolory , who bears the god moa artua in his arms , and carries in one hand a small trough , hollowed out in the likeness of a canoe . the priest comes along dandling his charge as if it were a lachrymose infant he was endeavouring to put into a good humour . presently entering the ti , he seats himself on the mats as composedly as a juggler about to perform his sleight-of-hand tricks ; and with the chiefs disposed in a circle around him , commences his ceremony . in the first place he gives moa artua an affectionate hug , then caressingly lays him to his breast , and , finally , whispers something in his ear ; the rest of the company listening eagerly for a reply . but the baby-god is deaf or dumb , -- perhaps both , for never a word does , he utter . at last kolory speaks a little louder , and soon growing angry , comes boldly out with what he has to say and bawls to him . he put me in mind of a choleric fellow , who , after trying in vain to communicated a secret to a deaf man , all at once flies into a passion and screams it out so that every one may hear . still moa artua remains as quiet as ever ; and kolory , seemingly losing his temper , fetches him a box over the head , strips him of his tappa and red cloth , and laying him in a state of nudity in a little trough , covers him from sight . at this proceeding all present loudly applaud and signify their approval by uttering the adjective ‘ motarkee ’ with violent emphasis . kolory however , is so desirous his conduct should meet with unqualified approbation , that he inquires of each individual separately whether under existing circumstances he has not done perfectly right in shutting up moa artua . the invariable response is ‘ aa , aa ’ ( yes , yes ) , repeated over again and again in a manner which ought to quiet the scruples of the most conscientious . after a few moments kolory brings forth his doll again , and while arraying it very carefully in the tappa and red cloth , alternately fondles and chides it . the toilet being completed , he once more speaks to it aloud . the whole company hereupon show the greatest interest ; while the priest holding moa artua to his ear interprets to them what he pretends the god is confidentially communicating to him . some items intelligence appear to tickle all present amazingly ; for one claps his hands in a rapture ; another shouts with merriment ; and a third leaps to his feet and capers about like a madman .
melville	typee	what under the sun moa artua on these occasions had to say to kolory i never could find out ; but i could not help thinking that the former showed a sad want of spirit in being disciplined into making those disclosures , which at first he seemed bent on withholding . whether the priest honestly interpreted what he believed the divinity said to him , or whether he was not all the while guilty of a vile humbug , i shall not presume to decide . at any rate , whatever as coming from the god was imparted to those present seemed to be generally of a complimentary nature : a fact which illustrates the sagacity of kolory , or else the timeserving disposition of this hardly used deity .
melville	typee	moa artua having nothing more to say , his bearer goes to nursing him again , in which occupation , however , he is soon interrupted by a question put by one of the warriors to the god . kolory hereupon snatches it up to his ear again , and after listening attentively , once more officiates as the organ of communication . a multitude of questions and answers having passed between the parties , much to the satisfaction of those who propose them , the god is put tenderly to bed in the trough , and the whole company unite in a long chant , led off by kolory . this ended , the ceremony is over ; the chiefs rise to their feet in high good humour , and my lord archbishop , after chatting awhile , and regaling himself with a whiff or two from a pipe of tobacco , tucks the canoe under his arm and marches off with it .
melville	typee	the whole of these proceedings were like those of a parcel of children playing with dolls and baby houses . for a youngster scarcely ten inches high , and with so few early advantages as he doubtless had had , moa artua was certainly a precocious little fellow if he really said all that was imputed to him ; but for what reason this poor devil of a deity , thus cuffed about , cajoled , and shut up in a box , was held in greater estimation than the full-grown and dignified personages of the taboo groves , i can not divine . and yet mehevi , and other chiefs of unquestionable veracity -- to say nothing of the primate himself -- assured me over and over again that moa artua was the tutelary deity of typee , and was more to be held in honour than a whole battalion of the clumsy idols in the hoolah hoolah grounds .
melville	typee	kory-kory -- who seemed to have devoted considerable attention to the study of theology , as he knew the names of all the graven images in the valley , and often repeated them over to me -- likewise entertained some rather enlarged ideas with regard to the character and pretensions of moa artua . he once gave me to understand , with a gesture there was no misconceiving , that if he ( moa artua ) were so minded he could cause a cocoanut tree to sprout out of his ( kory-kory ’ s ) head ; and that it would be the easiest thing in life for him ( moa artua ) to take the whole island of nukuheva in his mouth and dive down to the bottom of the sea with it .
melville	typee	but in sober seriousness , i hardly knew what to make of the religion of the valley . there was nothing that so much perplexed the illustrious cook , in his intercourse with the south sea islanders , as their sacred rites . although this prince of navigators was in many instances assisted by interpreters in the prosecution of his researches , he still frankly acknowledges that he was at a loss to obtain anything like a clear insight into the puzzling arcana of their faith . a similar admission has been made by other eminent voyagers : by carteret , byron , kotzebue , and vancouver .
melville	typee	for my own part , although hardly a day passed while i remained upon the island that i did not witness some religious ceremony or other , it was very much like seeing a parcel of ‘ freemasons ’ making secret signs to each other ; i saw everything , but could comprehend nothing .
melville	typee	on the whole , i am inclined to believe , that the islanders in the pacific have no fixed and definite ideas whatever on the subject of religion . i am persuaded that kolory himself would be effectually posed were he called upon to draw up the articles of his faith and pronounce the creed by which he hoped to be saved . in truth , the typees , so far as their actions evince , submitted to no laws human or divine -- always excepting the thrice mysterious taboo . the ‘ independent electors ’ of the valley were not to be brow-beaten by chiefs , priests , idol or devils . as for the luckless idols , they received more hard knocks than supplications . i do not wonder that some of them looked so grim , and stood so bolt upright as if fearful of looking to the right or the left lest they should give any one offence . the fact is , they had to carry themselves ‘ pretty straight , ’ or suffer the consequences . their worshippers were such a precious set of fickle-minded and irreverent heathens , that there was no telling when they might topple one of them over , break it to pieces , and making a fire with it on the very altar itself , fall to roasting the offerings of bread-fruit , and at them in spite of its teeth .
melville	typee	in how little reverence these unfortunate deities were held by the natives was on one occasion most convincingly proved to me. -- walking with kory-kory through the deepest recesses of the groves , i perceived a curious looking image , about six feet in height which originally had been placed upright against a low pi-pi , surmounted by a ruinous bamboo temple , but having become fatigued and weak in the knees , was now carelessly leaning against it . the idol was partly concealed by the foliage of a tree which stood near , and whose leafy boughs drooped over the pile of stones , as if to protect the rude fane from the decay to which it was rapidly hastening . the image itself was nothing more than a grotesquely shaped log , carved in the likeness of a portly naked man with the arms clasped over the head , the jaws thrown wide apart , and its thick shapeless legs bowed into an arch . it was much decayed . the lower part was overgrown with a bright silky moss . thin spears of grass sprouted from the distended mouth , and fringed the outline of the head and arms . his godship had literally attained a green old age . all its prominent points were bruised and battered , or entirely rotted away . the nose had taken its departure , and from the general appearance of the head it might have , been supposed that the wooden divinity , in despair at the neglect of its worshippers , had been trying to beat its own brains out against the surrounding trees .
melville	typee	i drew near to inspect more closely this strange object of idolatry , but halted reverently at the distance of two or three paces , out of regard to the religious prejudices of my valet . as soon , however , as kory-kory perceived that i was in one of my inquiring , scientific moods , to my astonishment , he sprang to the side of the idol , and pushing it away from the stones against which it rested , endeavoured to make it stand upon its legs . but the divinity had lost the use of them altogether ; and while kory-kory was trying to prop it up , placing a stick between it and the pi-pi , the monster fell clumsily to the ground , and would have infallibly have broken its neck had not kory-kory providentially broken its fall by receiving its whole weight on his own half-crushed back . i never saw the honest fellow in such a rage before . he leaped furiously to his feet , and seizing the stick , began beating the poor image : every moment , or two pausing and talking to it in the most violent manner , as if upbraiding it for the accident . when his indignation had subsided a little he whirled the idol about most profanely , so as to give me an opportunity of examining it on all sides . i am quite sure i never should have presumed to have taken such liberties with the god myself , and i was not a little shocked at kory-kory ’ s impiety .
melville	typee	this anecdote speaks for itself . when one of the inferior order of natives could show such contempt for a venerable and decrepit god of the groves , what the state of religion must be among the people in general is easy to be imagined . in truth , i regard the typees as a back-slidden generation . they are sunk in religious sloth , and require a spiritual revival . a long prosperity of bread-fruit and cocoanuts has rendered them remiss in the performance of their higher obligations . the wood-rot malady is spreading among the idols -- the fruit upon their altars is becoming offensive -- the temples themselves need rethatching -- the tattooed clergy are altogether too light-hearted and lazy -- and their flocks are going astray .
melville	typee	chapter twenty-five general information gathered at the festival -- personal beauty of the typees -- their superiority over the inhabitants of the other islands -- diversity of complexion -- a vegetable cosmetic and ointment -- testimony of voyagers to the uncommon beauty of the marquesans -- few evidences of intercourse with civilized beings -- dilapidated musket -- primitive simplicity of government -- regal dignity of mehevi
melville	typee	although i had been unable during the late festival to obtain information on many interesting subjects which had much excited my curiosity , still that important event had not passed by without adding materially to my general knowledge of the islanders .
melville	typee	i was especially struck by the physical strength and beauty which they displayed , by their great superiority in these respects over the inhabitants of the neighbouring bay of nukuheva , and by the singular contrasts they presented among themselves in their various shades of complexion .
melville	typee	in beauty of form they surpassed anything i had ever seen . not a single instance of natural deformity was observable in all the throng attending the revels . occasionally i noticed among the men the scars of wounds they had received in battle ; and sometimes , though very seldom , the loss of a finger , an eye , or an arm , attributable to the same cause . with these exceptions , every individual appeared free from those blemishes which sometimes mar the effect of an otherwise perfect form . but their physical excellence did not merely consist in an exemption from these evils ; nearly every individual of their number might have been taken for a sculptor ’ s model .
melville	typee	when i remembered that these islanders derived no advantage from dress , but appeared in all the naked simplicity of nature , i could not avoid comparing them with the fine gentlemen and dandies who promenade such unexceptionable figures in our frequented thoroughfares . stripped of the cunning artifices of the tailor , and standing forth in the garb of eden -- what a sorry , set of round-shouldered , spindle-shanked , crane-necked varlets would civilized men appear ! stuffed calves , padded breasts , and scientifically cut pantaloons would then avail them nothing , and the effect would be truly deplorable .
melville	typee	nothing in the appearance of the islanders struck me more forcibly than the whiteness of their teeth . the novelist always compares the masticators of his heroine to ivory ; but i boldly pronounce the teeth of the typee to be far more beautiful than ivory itself . the jaws of the oldest graybeards among them were much better garnished than those of most of the youths of civilized countries ; while the teeth of the young and middle-aged , in their purity and whiteness , were actually dazzling to the eye . their marvellous whiteness of the teeth is to be ascribed to the pure vegetable diet of these people , and the uninterrupted healthfulness of their natural mode of life .
melville	typee	the men , in almost every instance , are of lofty stature , scarcely ever less than six feet in height , while the other sex are uncommonly diminutive . the early period of life at which the human form arrives at maturity in this generous tropical climate , likewise deserves to be mentioned . a little creature , not more than thirteen years of age , and who in other particulars might be regarded as a mere child , is often seen nursing her own baby , whilst lads who , under less ripening skies , would be still at school , are here responsible fathers of families .
melville	typee	on first entering the typee valley , i had been struck with the marked contrast presented by its inhabitants with those of the bay i had previously left . in the latter place , i had not been favourably impressed with the personal appearance of the male portion of the population ; although with the females , excepting in some truly melancholy instances , i had been wonderfully pleased . i had observed that even the little intercourse europeans had carried on with the nukuheva natives had not failed to leave its traces amongst them . one of the most dreadful curses under which humanity labours had commenced its havocks , and betrayed , as it ever does among the south sea islanders , the most aggravated symptoms . from this , as from all other foreign inflictions , the yet uncontaminated tenants of the typee valley were wholly exempt ; and long may they continue so . better will it be for them for ever to remain the happy and innocent heathens and barbarians that they now are , than , like the wretched inhabitants of the sandwich islands , to enjoy the mere name of christians without experiencing any of the vital operations of true religion , whilst , at the same time , they are made the victims of the worst vices and evils of civilized life .
melville	typee	apart , however , from these considerations , i am inclined to believe that there exists a radical difference between the two tribes , if indeed they are not distinct races of men . to those who have merely touched at nukuheva bay , without visiting other portions of the island , it would hardly appear credible the diversities presented between the various small clans inhabiting so diminutive a spot . but the hereditary hostility which has existed between them for ages , fully accounts for this .
melville	typee	not so easy , however , is it to assign an adequate cause for the endless variety of complexions to be seen in the typee valley . during the festival , i had noticed several young females whose skins were almost as white as any saxon damsel ’ s ; a slight dash of the mantling brown being all that marked the difference . this comparative fairness of complexion , though in a great degree perfectly natural , is partly the result of an artificial process , and of an entire exclusion from the sun . the juice of the ‘ papa ’ root found in great abundance at the head of the valley , is held in great esteem as a cosmetic , with which many of the females daily anoint their whole person . the habitual use of it whitens and beautifies the skin . those of the young girls who resort to this method of heightening their charms , never expose themselves selves to the rays of the sun ; an observance , however , that produces little or no inconvenience , since there are but few of the inhabited portions of the vale which are not shaded over with a spreading canopy of boughs , so that one may journey from house to house , scarcely deviating from the direct course , and yet never once see his shadow cast upon the ground .
melville	typee	the ‘ papa ’ , when used , is suffered to remain upon the skin for several hours ; being of a light green colour , it consequently imparts for the time a similar hue to the complexion . nothing , therefore , can be imagined more singular than the appearance of these nearly naked damsels immediately after the application of the cosmetic . to look at one of them you would almost suppose she was some vegetable in an unripe state ; and that , instead of living in the shade for ever , she ought to be placed out in the sun to ripen .
melville	typee	all the islanders are more or less in the habit of anointing themselves ; the women preferring the ‘ aker ’ to ‘ papa ’ , and the men using the oil of the cocoanut . mehevi was remarkable fond of mollifying his entire cuticle with this ointment . sometimes he might be seen , with his whole body fairly reeking with the perfumed oil of the nut , looking as if he had just emerged from a soap-boiler ’ s vat , or had undergone the process of dipping in a tallow-chandlery . to this cause perhaps , united to their frequent bathing and extreme cleanliness , is ascribable , in a great measure , the marvellous purity and smoothness of skin exhibited by the natives in general .
melville	typee	the prevailing tint among the women of the valley was a light olive , and of this style of complexion fayaway afforded the most beautiful example . others were still darker ; while not a few were of a genuine golden colour , and some of a swarthy hue .
melville	typee	as agreeing with much previously mentioned in this narrative i may here observe that mendanna , their discoverer , in his account of the marquesas , described the natives as wondrously beautiful to behold , and as nearly resembling the people of southern europe . the first of these islands seen by mendanna was la madelena , which is not far distant from nukuheva ; and its inhabitants in every respect resemble those dwelling on that and the other islands of the group . figueroa , the chronicler of mendanna ’ s voyage , says , that on the morning the land was descried , when the spaniards drew near the shore , there sallied forth , in rude progression , about seventy canoes , and at the same time many of the inhabitants ( females i presume ) made towards the ships by swimming . he adds , that ‘ in complexion they were nearly white ; of good stature , and finely formed ; and on their faces and bodies were delineated representations of fishes and other devices ’ . the old don then goes on to say , ‘ there came , among others , two lads paddling their canoe , whose eyes were fixed on the ship ; they had beautiful faces and the most promising animation of countenance ; and were in all things so becoming , that the pilot-mayor quiros affirmed , nothing in his life ever caused him so much regret as the leaving such fine creatures to be lost in that country. ’ * more than two hundred years have gone by since the passage of which the above is a translation was written ; and it appears to me now , as i read it , as fresh and true as if written but yesterday . the islanders are still the same ; and i have seen boys in the typee valley of whose ‘ beautiful faces ’ and promising ‘ animation of countenance ’ no one who has not beheld them can form any adequate idea . cook , in the account of his voyage , pronounces the marquesans as by far the most splendid islanders in the south seas . stewart , the chaplain of the u.s. ship vincennes , in his ‘ scenes in the south seas ’ , expresses , in more than one place , his amazement at the surpassing loveliness of the women ; and says that many of the nukuheva damsels reminded him forcibly of the most celebrated beauties in his own land . fanning , a yankee mariner of some reputation , likewise records his lively impressions of the physical appearance of these people ; and commodore david porter of the u.s. frigate essex , is said to have been vastly smitten by the beauty of the ladies . their great superiority over all other polynesians can not fail to attract the notice of those who visit the principal groups in the pacific . the voluptuous tahitians are the only people who at all deserve to be compared with them ; while the dark-haired hawaiians and the woolly-headed feejees are immeasurably inferior to them . the distinguishing characteristic of the marquesan islanders , and that which at once strikes you , is the european cast of their features -- a peculiarity seldom observable among other uncivilized people . many of their faces present profiles classically beautiful , and in the valley of typee i saw several who , like the stranger marnoo , were in every respect models of beauty .
melville	typee	* this passage , which is cited as an almost literal translation from the original , i found in a small volume entitled ‘ circumnavigation of the globe , in which volume are several extracts from ‘ dalrymple ’ s historical collections ’ . the last-mentioned work i have never seen , but it is said to contain a very correct english version of great part of the learned doctor christoval suaverde da figueroa ’ s history of mendanna ’ s voyage , published at madrid , a.d. 1613 .
melville	typee	some of the natives present at the feast of calabashes had displayed a few articles of european dress ; disposed however , about their persons after their own peculiar fashion . among these i perceived two pieces of cotton-cloth which poor toby and myself had bestowed upon our youthful guides the afternoon we entered the valley . they were evidently reserved for gala days ; and during those of the festival they rendered the young islanders who wore them very distinguished characters . the small number who were similarly adorned , and the great value they appeared to place upon the most common and most trivial articles , furnished ample evidence of the very restricted intercourse they held with vessels touching at the island . a few cotton handkerchiefs , of a gay pattern , tied about the neck , and suffered to fall over the shoulder ; strips of fanciful calico , swathed about the loins , were nearly all i saw .
melville	typee	indeed , throughout the valley , there were few things of any kind to be seen of european origin . all i ever saw , besides the articles just alluded to , were the six muskets preserved in the ti , and three or four similar implements of warfare hung up in other houses ; some small canvas bags , partly filled with bullets and powder , and half a dozen old hatchet-heads , with the edges blunted and battered to such a degree as to render them utterly useless . these last seemed to be regarded as nearly worthless by the natives ; and several times they held up , one of them before me , and throwing it aside with a gesture of disgust , manifested their contempt for anything that could so soon become unserviceable .
melville	typee	but the muskets , the powder , and the bullets were held in most extravagant esteem . the former , from their great age and the peculiarities they exhibited , were well worthy a place in any antiquarian ’ s armoury . i remember in particular one that hung in the ti , and which mehevi -- supposing as a matter of course that i was able to repair it -- had put into my hands for that purpose . it was one of those clumsy , old-fashioned , english pieces known generally as tower hill muskets , and , for aught i know , might have been left on the island by wallace , carteret , cook , or vancouver . the stock was half rotten and worm-eaten ; the lock was as rusty and about as well adapted to its ostensible purpose as an old door-hinge ; the threading of the screws about the trigger was completely worn away ; while the barrel shook in the wood . such was the weapon the chief desired me to restore to its original condition . as i did not possess the accomplishments of a gunsmith , and was likewise destitute of the necessary tools , i was reluctantly obliged to signify my inability to perform the task . at this unexpected communication mehevi regarded me , for a moment , as if he half suspected i was some inferior sort of white man , who after all did not know much more than a typee . however , after a most laboured explanation of the matter , i succeeded in making him understand the extreme difficulty of the task . scarcely satisfied with my apologies , however , he marched off with the superannuated musket in something of a huff , as if he would no longer expose it to the indignity of being manipulated by such unskilful fingers .
melville	typee	during the festival i had not failed to remark the simplicity of manner , the freedom from all restraint , and , to certain degree , the equality of condition manifested by the natives in general . no one appeared to assume any arrogant pretensions . there was little more than a slight difference in costume to distinguish the chiefs from the other natives . all appeared to mix together freely , and without any reserve ; although i noticed that the wishes of a chief , even when delivered in the mildest tone , received the same immediate obedience which elsewhere would have been only accorded to a peremptory command . what may be the extent of the authority of the chiefs over the rest of the tribe , i will not venture to assert ; but from all i saw during my stay in the valley , i was induced to believe that in matters concerning the general welfare it was very limited . the required degree of deference towards them , however , was willingly and cheerfully yielded ; and as all authority is transmitted from father to son , i have no doubt that one of the effects here , as elsewhere , of high birth , is to induce respect and obedience .
melville	typee	the civil institutions of the marquesas islands appear to be in this , as in other respects , directly the reverse of those of the tahitian and hawaiian groups , where the original power of the king and chiefs was far more despotic than that of any tyrant in civilized countries . at tahiti it used to be death for one of the inferior orders to approach , without permission , under the shadow , of the king ’ s house ; or to fail in paying the customary reverence when food destined for the king was borne past them by his messengers . at the sandwich islands , kaahumanu , the gigantic old dowager queen -- a woman of nearly four hundred pounds weight , and who is said to be still living at mowee -- was accustomed , in some of her terrific gusts of temper , to snatch up an ordinary sized man who had offended her , and snap his spine across her knee . incredible as this may seem , it is a fact . while at lahainaluna -- the residence of this monstrous jezebel -- a humpbacked wretch was pointed out to me , who , some twenty-five years previously , had had the vertebrae of his backbone very seriously discomposed by his gentle mistress .
melville	typee	the particular grades of rank existing among the chiefs of typee , i could not in all cases determine . previous to the feast of calabashes i had been puzzled what particular station to assign to mehevi . but the important part he took upon that occasion convinced me that he had no superior among the inhabitants of the valley . i had invariably noticed a certain degree of deference paid to him by all with whom i had ever seen him brought in contact ; but when i remembered that my wanderings had been confined to a limited portion of the valley , and that towards the sea a number of distinguished chiefs resided , some of whom had separately visited me at marheyo ’ s house , and whom , until the festival , i had never seen in the company of mehevi , i felt disposed to believe that his rank after all might not be particularly elevated .
melville	typee	the revels , however , had brought together all the warriors whom i had seen individually and in groups at different times and places . among them mehevi moved with an easy air of superiority which was not to be mistaken ; and he whom i had only looked at as the hospitable host of the ti , and one of the military leaders of the tribe , now assumed in my eyes the dignity of royal station . his striking costume , no less than his naturally commanding figure , seemed indeed to give him pre-eminence over the rest . the towering helmet of feathers that he wore raised him in height above all who surrounded him ; and though some others were similarly adorned , the length and luxuriance of their plumes were inferior to his .
melville	typee	mehevi was in fact the greatest of the chiefs -- the head of his clan -- the sovereign of the valley ; and the simplicity of the social institutions of the people could not have been more completely proved than by the fact , that after having been several weeks in the valley , and almost in daily intercourse with mehevi , i should have remained until the time of the festival ignorant of his regal character . but a new light had now broken in upon me . the ti was the palace -- and mehevi the king . both the one and the other of a most simple and patriarchal nature : it must be allowed , and wholly unattended by the ceremonious pomp which usually surrounds the purple .
melville	typee	after having made this discovery i could not avoid congratulating myself that mehevi had from the first taken me as it were under his royal protection , and that he still continued to entertain for me the warmest regard , as far at least as i was enabled to judge from appearances . for the future i determined to pay most assiduous court to him , hoping that eventually through his kindness i might obtain my liberty .

melville	typee	king mehevi ! -- a goodly sounding title -- and why should i not bestow it upon the foremost man in the valley of typee ? the republican missionaries of oahu cause to be gazetted in the court journal , published at honolulu , the most trivial movement of ‘ his gracious majesty ’ king kammehammaha iii , and ‘ their highnesses the princes of the blood royal ’ . * and who is his ‘ gracious majesty ’ , and what the quality of this blood royal ’ ? -- his ‘ gracious majesty ’ is a fat , lazy , negro-looking blockhead , with as little character as power . he has lost the noble traits of the barbarian , without acquiring the redeeming graces of a civilized being ; and , although a member of the hawiian temperance society , is a most inveterate dram-drinker .
melville	typee	* accounts like these are sometimes copied into english and american journals . they lead the reader to infer that the arts and customs of civilized life are rapidly refining the natives of the sandwich islands . but let no one be deceived by these accounts . the chiefs swagger about in gold lace and broadcloth , while the great mass of the common people are nearly as primitive in their appearance as in the days of cook . in the progress of events at these islands , the two classes are receding from each other ; the chiefs are daily becoming more luxurious and extravagant in their style of living , and the common people more and more destitute of the necessaries and decencies of life . but the end to which both will arrive at last will be the same : the one are fast destroying themselves by sensual indulgences , and the other are fast being destroyed by a complication of disorders , and the want of wholesome food . the resources of the domineering chiefs are wrung from the starving serfs , and every additional bauble with which they bedeck themselves is purchased by the sufferings of their bondsmen ; so that the measure of gew-gaw refinement attained by the chiefs is only an index to the actual state in which the greater portion of the population lie grovelling .
melville	typee	the ‘ blood royal ’ is an extremely thick , depraved fluid ; formed principally of raw fish , bad brandy , and european sweetmeats , and is charged with a variety of eruptive humours , which are developed in sundry blotches and pimples upon the august face of ‘ majesty itself ’ , and the angelic countenances of the ‘ princes and princesses of the blood royal ’ !
melville	typee	now , if the farcical puppet of a chief magistrate in the sandwich islands be allowed the title of king , why should it be withheld from the noble savage mehevi , who is a thousand times more worthy of the appellation ? all hail , therefore , mehevi , king of the cannibal valley , and long life and prosperity to his typeean majesty ! may heaven for many a year preserve him , the uncompromising foe of nukuheva and the french , if a hostile attitude will secure his lovely domain from the remorseless inflictions of south sea civilization .
melville	typee	previously to seeing the dancing widows i had little idea that there were any matrimonial relations subsisting in typee , and i should as soon have thought of a platonic affection being cultivated between the sexes , as of the solemn connection of man and wife . to be sure , there were old marheyo and tinor , who seemed to have a sort of nuptial understanding with one another ; but for all that , i had sometimes observed a comical-looking old gentleman dressed in a suit of shabby tattooing , who had the audacity to take various liberties with the lady , and that too in the very presence of the old warrior her husband , who looked on as good-naturedly as if nothing was happening . this behaviour , until subsequent discoveries enlightened me , puzzled me more than anything else i witnessed in typee .
melville	typee	as for mehevi , i had supposed him a confirmed bachelor , as well as most of the principal chiefs . at any rate , if they had wives and families , they ought to have been ashamed of themselves ; for sure i am , they never troubled themselves about any domestic affairs . in truth , mehevi seemed to be the president of a club of hearty fellows , who kept ‘ bachelor ’ s hall ’ in fine style at the ti . i had no doubt but that they regarded children as odious incumbrances ; and their ideas of domestic felicity were sufficiently shown in the fact , that they allowed no meddlesome housekeepers to turn topsy-turvy those snug little arrangements they had made in their comfortable dwelling . i strongly suspected however , that some of these jolly bachelors were carrying on love intrigues with the maidens of the tribe ; although they did not appear publicly to acknowledge them . i happened to pop upon mehevi three or four times when he was romping -- in a most undignified manner for a warrior king -- with one of the prettiest little witches in the valley . she lived with an old woman and a young man , in a house near marheyo ’ s ; and although in appearance a mere child herself , had a noble boy about a year old , who bore a marvellous resemblance to mehevi , whom i should certainly have believed to have been the father , were it not that the little fellow had no triangle on his face -- but on second thoughts , tattooing is not hereditary . mehevi , however , was not the only person upon whom the damsel moonoony smiled -- the young fellow of fifteen , who permanently resided in the home with her , was decidedly in her good graces . i sometimes beheld both him and the chief making love at the same time . is it possible , thought i , that the valiant warrior can consent to give up a corner in the thing he loves ? this too was a mystery which , with others of the same kind , was afterwards satisfactorily explained .
melville	typee	during the second day of the feast of calabashes , kory-kory -- being determined that i should have some understanding on these matters -- had , in the course of his explanations , directed my attention to a peculiarity i had frequently remarked among many of the females ; -- principally those of a mature age and rather matronly appearance . this consisted in having the right hand and the left foot most elaborately tattooed ; whilst the rest of the body was wholly free from the operation of the art , with the exception of the minutely dotted lips and slight marks on the shoulders , to which i have previously referred as comprising the sole tattooing exhibited by fayaway , in common with other young girls of her age . the hand and foot thus embellished were , according to kory-kory , the distinguishing badge of wedlock , so far as that social and highly commendable institution is known among those people . it answers , indeed , the same purpose as the plain gold ring worn by our fairer spouses .
melville	typee	after kory-kory ’ s explanation of the subject , i was for some time studiously respectful in the presence of all females thus distinguished , and never ventured to indulge in the slightest approach to flirtation with any of their number . married women , to be sure ! -- i knew better than to offend them .
melville	typee	a further insight , however , into the peculiar domestic customs of the inmates of the valley did away in a measure with the severity of my scruples , and convinced me that i was deceived in some at least of my conclusions . a regular system of polygamy exists among the islanders ; but of a most extraordinary nature , -- a plurality of husbands , instead of wives ! and this solitary fact speaks volumes for the gentle disposition of the male population .
melville	typee	where else , indeed , could such a practice exist , even for a single day ? -- imagine a revolution brought about in a turkish seraglio , and the harem rendered the abode of bearded men ; or conceive some beautiful woman in our own country running distracted at the sight of her numerous lovers murdering one another before her eyes , out of jealousy for the unequal distribution of her favours ! -- heaven defend us from such a state of things ! -- we are scarcely amiable and forbearing enough to submit to it .
melville	typee	i was not able to learn what particular ceremony was observed in forming the marriage contract , but am inclined to think that it must have been of a very simple nature . perhaps the mere ‘ popping the question ’ , as it is termed with us , might have been followed by an immediate nuptial alliance . at any rate , i have more than one reason to believe that tedious courtships are unknown in the valley of typee .
melville	typee	the males considerably outnumber the females . this holds true of many of the islands of polynesia , although the reverse of what is the case in most civilized countries . the girls are first wooed and won , at a very tender age , by some stripling in the household in which they reside . this , however , is a mere frolic of the affections , and no formal engagement is contracted . by the time this first love has a little subsided , a second suitor presents himself , of graver years , and carries both boy and girl away to his own habitation . this disinterested and generous-hearted fellow now weds the young couple -- marrying damsel and lover at the same time -- and all three thenceforth live together as harmoniously as so many turtles . i have heard of some men who in civilized countries rashly marry large families with their wives , but had no idea that there was any place where people married supplementary husbands with them . infidelity on either side is very rare . no man has more than one wife , and no wife of mature years has less than two husbands , -- sometimes she has three , but such instances are not frequent . the marriage tie , whatever it may be , does not appear to be indissoluble ; for separations occasionally happen . these , however , when they do take place , produce no unhappiness , and are preceded by no bickerings ; for the simple reason , that an ill-used wife or a henpecked husband is not obliged to file a bill in chancery to obtain a divorce . as nothing stands in the way of a separation , the matrimonial yoke sits easily and lightly , and a typee wife lives on very pleasant and sociable terms with her husband . on the whole , wedlock , as known among these typees , seems to be of a more distinct and enduring nature than is usually the case with barbarous people . a baneful promiscuous intercourse of the sexes is hereby avoided , and virtue , without being clamorously invoked , is , as it were , unconsciously practised .
melville	typee	the contrast exhibited between the marquesas and other islands of the pacific in this respect , is worthy of being noticed . at tahiti the marriage tie was altogether unknown ; and the relation of husband and wife , father and son , could hardly be said to exist . the arreory society -- one of the most singular institutions that ever existed in any part of the world -- spread universal licentiousness over the island . it was the voluptuous character of these people which rendered the disease introduced among them by de bougainville ’ s ships , in 1768 , doubly destructive . it visited them like a plague , sweeping them off by hundreds .
melville	typee	notwithstanding the existence of wedlock among the typees , the scriptural injunction to increase and multiply seems to be but indifferently attended to . i never saw any of those large families in arithmetical or step-ladder progression which one often meets with at home . i never knew of more than two youngsters living together in the same home , and but seldom even that number . as for the women , it was very plain that the anxieties of the nursery but seldom disturbed the serenity of their souls ; and they were never seen going about the valley with half a score of little ones tagging at their apron-strings , or rather at the bread-fruit-leaf they usually wore in the rear .
melville	typee	the ratio of increase among all the polynesian nations is very small ; and in some places as yet uncorrupted by intercourse with europeans , the births would appear not very little to outnumber the deaths ; the population in such instances remaining nearly the same for several successive generations , even upon those islands seldom or never desolated by wars , and among people with whom the crime of infanticide is altogether unknown . this would seem expressively ordained by providence to prevent the overstocking of the islands with a race too indolent to cultivate the ground , and who , for that reason alone , would , by any considerable increase in their numbers , be exposed to the most deplorable misery . during the entire period of my stay in the valley of typee , i never saw more than ten or twelve children under the age of six months , and only became aware of two births .
melville	typee	it is to the absence of the marriage tie that the late rapid decrease of the population of the sandwich islands and of tahiti is in part to be ascribed . the vices and diseases introduced among these unhappy people annually swell the ordinary mortality of the islands , while , from the same cause , the originally small number of births is proportionally decreased . thus the progress of the hawaiians and tahitians to utter extinction is accelerated in a sort of compound ratio .
melville	typee	i have before had occasion to remark , that i never saw any of the ordinary signs of a pace of sepulture in the valley , a circumstance which i attributed , at the time , to my living in a particular part of it , and being forbidden to extend my rambles to any considerable distance towards the sea . i have since thought it probable , however , that the typees , either desirous of removing from their sight the evidences of mortality , or prompted by a taste for rural beauty , may have some charming cemetery situation in the shadowy recesses along the base of the mountains . at nukuheva , two or three large quadrangular ‘ pi-pis ’ , heavily flagged , enclosed with regular stone walls , and shaded over and almost hidden from view by the interlacing branches of enormous trees , were pointed out to me as burial-places . the bodies , i understood , were deposited in rude vaults beneath the flagging , and were suffered to remain there without being disinterred . although nothing could be more strange and gloomy than the aspect of these places , where the lofty trees threw their dark shadows over rude blocks of stone , a stranger looking at them would have discerned none of the ordinary evidences of a place of sepulture .
melville	typee	during my stay in the valley , as none of its inmates were so accommodating as to die and be buried in order to gratify my curiosity with regard to their funeral rites , i was reluctantly obliged to remain in ignorance of them . as i have reason to believe , however , the observances of the typees in these matters are the same with those of all the other tribes in the island , i will here relate a scene i chanced to witness at nukuheva .
melville	typee	a young man had died , about daybreak , in a house near the beach . i had been sent ashore that morning , and saw a good deal of the preparations they were making for his obsequies . the body , neatly wrapped in a new white tappa , was laid out in an open shed of cocoanut boughs , upon a bier constructed of elastic bamboos ingeniously twisted together . this was supported about two feet from the ground , by large canes planted uprightly in the earth . two females , of a dejected appearance , watched by its side , plaintively chanting and beating the air with large grass fans whitened with pipe-clay . in the dwelling-house adjoining a numerous company we assembled , and various articles of food were being prepared for consumption . two or three individuals , distinguished by head-dresses of beautiful tappa , and wearing a great number of ornaments , appeared to officiate as masters of the ceremonies . by noon the entertainment had fairly begun and we were told that it would last during the whole of the two following days . with the exception of those who mourned by the corpse , every one seemed disposed to drown the sense of the late bereavement in convivial indulgence . the girls , decked out in their savage finery , danced ; the old men chanted ; the warriors smoked and chatted ; and the young and lusty , of both sexes , feasted plentifully , and seemed to enjoy themselves as pleasantly as they could have done had it been a wedding .
melville	typee	the islanders understand the art of embalming , and practise it with such success that the bodies of their great chiefs are frequently preserved for many years in the very houses where they died . i saw three of these in my visit to the bay of tior . one was enveloped in immense folds of tappa , with only the face exposed , and hung erect against the side of the dwelling . the others were stretched out upon biers of bamboo , in open , elevated temples , which seemed consecrated to their memory . the heads of enemies killed in battle are invariably preserved and hung up as trophies in the house of the conqueror . i am not acquainted with the process which is in use , but believe that fumigation is the principal agency employed . all the remains which i saw presented the appearance of a ham after being suspended for some time in a smoky chimney .
melville	typee	but to return from the dead to the living . the late festival had drawn together , as i had every reason to believe , the whole population of the vale , and consequently i was enabled to make some estimate with regard to its numbers . i should imagine that there were about two thousand inhabitants in typee ; and no number could have been better adapted to the extent of the valley . the valley is some nine miles in length , and may average one in breadth ; the houses being distributed at wide intervals throughout its whole extent , principally , however , towards the head of the vale . there are no villages ; the houses stand here and there in the shadow of the groves , or are scattered along the banks of the winding stream ; their golden-hued bamboo sides and gleaming white thatch forming a beautiful contrast to the perpetual verdure in which they are embowered . there are no roads of any kind in the valley . nothing but a labyrinth of footpaths twisting and turning among the thickets without end .
melville	typee	the penalty of the fall presses very lightly upon the valley of typee ; for , with the one solitary exception of striking a light , i scarcely saw any piece of work performed there which caused the sweat to stand upon a single brow . as for digging and delving for a livelihood , the thing is altogether unknown . nature has planted the bread-fruit and the banana , and in her own good time she brings them to maturity , when the idle savage stretches forth his hand , and satisfies his appetite .
melville	typee	ill-fated people ! i shudder when i think of the change a few years will produce in their paradisaical abode ; and probably when the most destructive vices , and the worst attendances on civilization , shall have driven all peace and happiness from the valley , the magnanimous french will proclaim to the world that the marquesas islands have been converted to christianity ! and this the catholic world will doubtless consider as a glorious event . heaven help the ‘ isles of the sea ’ ! -- the sympathy which christendom feels for them , has , alas ! in too many instances proved their bane .
melville	typee	how little do some of these poor islanders comprehend when they look around them , that no inconsiderable part of their disasters originate in certain tea-party excitements , under the influence of which benevolent-looking gentlemen in white cravats solicit alms , and old ladies in spectacles , and young ladies in sober russet gowns , contribute sixpences towards the creation of a fund , the object of which is to ameliorate the spiritual condition of the polynesians , but whose end has almost invariably been to accomplish their temporal destruction !
melville	typee	let the savages be civilized , but civilize them with benefits , and not with evils ; and let heathenism be destroyed , but not by destroying the heathen . the anglo-saxon hive have extirpated paganism from the greater part of the north american continent ; but with it they have likewise extirpated the greater portion of the red race . civilization is gradually sweeping from the earth the lingering vestiges of paganism , and at the same time the shrinking forms of its unhappy worshippers .
melville	typee	among the islands of polynesia , no sooner are the images overturned , the temples demolished , and the idolators converted into nominal christians , that disease , vice , and premature death make their appearance . the depopulated land is then recruited from the rapacious , hordes of enlightened individuals who settle themselves within its borders , and clamorously announce the progress of the truth . neat villas , trim gardens , shaven lawns , spires , and cupolas arise , while the poor savage soon finds himself an interloper in the country of his fathers , and that too on the very site of the hut where he was born . the spontaneous fruits of the earth , which god in his wisdom had ordained for the support of the indolent natives , remorselessly seized upon and appropriated by the stranger , are devoured before the eyes of the starving inhabitants , or sent on board the numerous vessels which now touch at their shores .
melville	typee	when the famished wretches are cut off in this manner from their natural supplies , they are told by their benefactors to work and earn their support by the sweat of their brows ! but to no fine gentleman born to hereditary opulence , does this manual labour come more unkindly than to the luxurious indian when thus robbed of the bounty of heaven . habituated to a life of indolence , he can not and will not exert himself ; and want , disease , and vice , all evils of foreign growth , soon terminate his miserable existence .
melville	typee	but what matters all this ? behold the glorious result ! -- the abominations of paganism have given way to the pure rites of the christian worship , -- the ignorant savage has been supplanted by the refined european ! look at honolulu , the metropolis of the sandwich islands ! -- a community of disinterested merchants , and devoted self-exiled heralds of the cross , located on the very spot that twenty years ago was defiled by the presence of idolatry . what a subject for an eloquent bible-meeting orator ! nor has such an opportunity for a display of missionary rhetoric been allowed to pass by unimproved ! -- but when these philanthropists send us such glowing accounts of one half of their labours , why does their modesty restrain them from publishing the other half of the good they have wrought ? -- not until i visited honolulu was i aware of the fact that the small remnant of the natives had been civilized into draught-horses ; and evangelized into beasts of burden . but so it is . they have been literally broken into the traces , and are harnessed to the vehicles of their spiritual instructors like so many dumb brutes !
melville	typee	. . . . . . . lest the slightest misconception should arise from anything thrown out in this chapter , or indeed in any other part of the volume , let me here observe that against the cause of missions in , the abstract no christian can possibly be opposed : it is in truth a just and holy cause . but if the great end proposed by it be spiritual , the agency employed to accomplish that end is purely earthly ; and , although the object in view be the achievement of much good , that agency may nevertheless be productive of evil . in short , missionary undertaking , however it may blessed of heaven , is in itself but human ; and subject , like everything else , to errors and abuses . and have not errors and abuses crept into the most sacred places , and may there not be unworthy or incapable missionaries abroad , as well as ecclesiastics of similar character at home ? may not the unworthiness or incapacity of those who assume apostolic functions upon the remote islands of the sea more easily escape detection by the world at large than if it were displayed in the heart of a city ? an unwarranted confidence in the sanctity of its apostles -- a proneness to regard them as incapable of guile -- and an impatience of the least suspicion to their rectitude as men or christians , have ever been prevailing faults in the church . nor is this to be wondered at : for subject as christianity is to the assaults of unprincipled foes , we are naturally disposed to regard everything like an exposure of ecclesiastical misconduct as the offspring of malevolence or irreligious feeling . not even this last consideration , however shall deter me from the honest expression of my sentiments .
melville	typee	there is something apparently wrong in the practical operations of the sandwich islands mission . those who from pure religious motives contribute to the support of this enterprise should take care to ascertain that their donations , flowing through many devious channels , at last effect their legitimate object , the conversion of the hawaiians . i urge this not because i doubt the moral probity of those who disburse the funds , but because i know that they are not rightly applied . to read pathetic accounts of missionary hardships , and glowing descriptions of conversion , and baptisms , taking place beneath palm-trees , is one thing ; and to go to the sandwich islands and see the missionaries dwelling in picturesque and prettily furnished coral-rock villas , whilst the miserable natives are committing all sorts of immorality around them , is quite another .
melville	typee	in justice to the missionaries , however , i will willingly admit , that where-ever evils may have resulted from their collective mismanagement of the business of the mission , and from the want of vital piety evinced by some of their number , still the present deplorable condition of the sandwich islands is by no means wholly chargeable against them . the demoralizing influence of a dissolute foreign population , and the frequent visits of all descriptions of vessels , have tended not a little to increase the evils alluded to . in a word , here , as in every case where civilization has in any way been introduced among those whom we call savages , she has scattered her vices , and withheld her blessings .
melville	typee	as wise a man as shakespeare has said , that the bearer of evil tidings hath but a losing office ; and so i suppose will it prove with me , in communicating to the trusting friends of the hawiian mission what has been disclosed in various portions of this narrative . i am persuaded , however , that as these disclosures will by their very nature attract attention , so they will lead to something which will not be without ultimate benefit to the cause of christianity in the sandwich islands .
melville	typee	i have but one more thing to add in connection with this subject -- those things which i have stated as facts will remain facts , in spite of whatever the bigoted or incredulous may say or write against them . my reflections , however , on those facts may not be free from error . if such be the case , i claim no further indulgence than should be conceded to every man whose object is to do good .
melville	typee	chapter twenty-seven the social condition and general character of the typees i have already mentioned that the influence exerted over the people of the valley by their chiefs was mild in the extreme ; and as to any general rule or standard of conduct by which the commonality were governed in their intercourse with each other , so far as my observation extended , i should be almost tempted to say , that none existed on the island , except , indeed , the mysterious ‘ taboo ’ be considered as such . during the time i lived among the typees , no one was ever put upon his trial for any offence against the public . to all appearance there were no courts of law or equity . there was no municipal police for the purpose of apprehending vagrants and disorderly characters . in short , there were no legal provisions whatever for the well-being and conservation of society , the enlightened end of civilized legislation . and yet everything went on in the valley with a harmony and smoothness unparalleled , i will venture to assert , in the most select , refined , and pious associations of mortals in christendom . how are we to explain this enigma ? these islanders were heathens ! savages ! ay , cannibals ! and how came they without the aid of established law , to exhibit , in so eminent a degree , that social order which is the greatest blessing and highest pride of the social state ?
melville	typee	it may reasonably be inquired , how were these people governed ? how were their passions controlled in their everyday transactions ? it must have been by an inherent principle of honesty and charity towards each other . they seemed to be governed by that sort of tacit common-sense law which , say what they will of the inborn lawlessness of the human race , has its precepts graven on every breast . the grand principles of virtue and honour , however they may be distorted by arbitrary codes , are the same all the world over : and where these principles are concerned , the right or wrong of any action appears the same to the uncultivated as to the enlightened mind . it is to this indwelling , this universally diffused perception of what is just and noble , that the integrity of the marquesans in their intercourse with each other , is to be attributed . in the darkest nights they slept securely , with all their worldly wealth around them , in houses the doors of which were never fastened . the disquieting ideas of theft or assassination never disturbed them .
melville	typee	each islander reposed beneath his own palmetto thatching , or sat under his own bread-fruit trees , with none to molest or alarm him . there was not a padlock in the valley , nor anything that answered the purpose of one : still there was no community of goods . this long spear , so elegantly carved , and highly polished , belongs to wormoonoo : it is far handsomer than the one which old marheyo so greatly prizes ; it is the most valuable article belonging to its owner . and yet i have seen it leaning against a cocoanut tree in the grove , and there it was found when sought for . here is a sperm-whale tooth , graven all over with cunning devices : it is the property of karluna ; it is the most precious of the damsel ’ s ornaments . in her estimation its price is far above rubies -- and yet there hangs the dental jewel by its cord of braided bark , in the girl ’ s house , which is far back in the valley ; the door is left open , and all the inmates have gone off to bathe in the stream . *
melville	typee	* the strict honesty which the inhabitants of nearly all the polynesian islands manifest toward each other , is in striking contrast with the thieving propensities some of them evince in their intercourse with foreigners . it would almost seem that , according to their peculiar code of morals , the pilfering of a hatchet or a wrought nail from a european , is looked upon as a praiseworthy action . or rather , it may be presumed , that bearing in mind the wholesale forays made upon them by their nautical visitors , they consider the property of the latter as a fair object of reprisal . this consideration , while it serves to reconcile an apparent contradiction in the moral character of the islanders , should in some measure alter that low opinion of it which the reader of south sea voyages is too apt to form .
melville	typee	so much for the respect in which ‘ personal property ’ is held in typee ; how secure an investment of ‘ real property ’ may be , i can not take upon me to say . whether the land of the valley was the joint property of its inhabitants , or whether it was parcelled out among a certain number of landed proprietors who allowed everybody to ‘ squat ’ and ‘ poach ’ as much as he or she pleased , i never could ascertain . at any rate , musty parchments and title-deeds there were none on the island ; and i am half inclined to believe that its inhabitants hold their broad valleys in fee simple from nature herself ; to have and to hold , so long as grass grows and water runs ; or until their french visitors , by a summary mode of conveyancing , shall appropriate them to their own benefit and behoof .
melville	typee	yesterday i saw kory-kory hie him away , armed with a long pole , with which , standing on the ground , he knocked down the fruit from the topmost boughs of the trees , and brought them home in his basket of cocoanut leaves . today i see an islander , whom i know to reside in a distant part of the valley , doing the self-same thing . on the sloping bank of the stream are a number of banana-trees i have often seen a score or two of young people making a merry foray on the great golden clusters , and bearing them off , one after another , to different parts of the vale , shouting and trampling as they went . no churlish old curmudgeon could have been the owner of that grove of bread-fruit trees , or of these gloriously yellow bunches of bananas .
melville	typee	from what i have said it will be perceived that there is a vast difference between ‘ personal property ’ and ‘ real estate ’ in the valley of typee . some individuals , of course , are more wealthy than others . for example , the ridge-pole of marheyo ’ s house bends under the weight of many a huge packet of tappa ; his long couch is laid with mats placed one upon the other seven deep . outside , tinor has ranged along in her bamboo cupboard -- or whatever the place may be called -- a goodly array of calabashes and wooden trenchers . now , the house just beyond the grove , and next to marheyo ’ s , occupied by ruaruga , is not quite so well furnished . there are only three moderate-sized packages swinging overhead : there are only two layers of mats beneath ; and the calabashes and trenchers are not so numerous , nor so tastefully stained and carved . but then , ruaruga has a house -- not so pretty a one , to be sure -- but just as commodious as marheyo ’ s ; and , i suppose , if he wished to vie with his neighbour ’ s establishment , he could do so with very little trouble . these , in short , constituted the chief differences perceivable in the relative wealth of the people in typee .
melville	typee	civilization does not engross all the virtues of humanity : she has not even her full share of them . they flourish in greater abundance and attain greater strength among many barbarous people . the hospitality of the wild arab , the courage of the north american indian , and the faithful friendship of some of the polynesian nations , far surpass anything of a similar kind among the polished communities of europe . if truth and justice , and the better principles of our nature , can not exist unless enforced by the statute-book , how are we to account for the social condition of the typees ? so pure and upright were they in all the relations of life , that entering their valley , as i did , under the most erroneous impressions of their character , i was soon led to exclaim in amazement : ‘ are these the ferocious savages , the blood-thirsty cannibals of whom i have heard such frightful tales ! they deal more kindly with each other , and are more humane than many who study essays on virtue and benevolence , and who repeat every night that beautiful prayer breathed first by the lips of the divine and gentle jesus. ’ i will frankly declare that after passing a few weeks in this valley of the marquesas , i formed a higher estimate of human nature than i had ever before entertained . but alas ! since then i have been one of the crew of a man-of-war , and the pent-up wickedness of five hundred men has nearly overturned all my previous theories .
melville	typee	there was one admirable trait in the general character of the typees which , more than anything else , secured my admiration : it was the unanimity of feeling they displayed on every occasion . with them there hardly appeared to be any difference of opinion upon any subject whatever . they all thought and acted alike . i do not conceive that they could support a debating society for a single night : there would be nothing to dispute about ; and were they to call a convention to take into consideration the state of the tribe , its session would be a remarkably short one . they showed this spirit of unanimity in every action of life ; everything was done in concert and good fellowship . i will give an instance of this fraternal feeling .
melville	typee	one day , in returning with kory-kory from my accustomed visit to the ti , we passed by a little opening in the grove ; on one side of which , my attendant informed me , was that afternoon to be built a dwelling of bamboo . at least a hundred of the natives were bringing materials to the ground , some carrying in their hands one or two of the canes which were to form the sides , others slender rods of the habiscus , strung with palmetto leaves , for the roof . every one contributed something to the work ; and by the united , but easy , and even indolent , labours of all , the entire work was completed before sunset . the islanders , while employed in erecting this tenement , reminded me of a colony of beavers at work . to be sure , they were hardly as silent and demure as those wonderful creatures , nor were they by any means as diligent . to tell the truth they were somewhat inclined to be lazy , but a perfect tumult of hilarity prevailed ; and they worked together so unitedly , and seemed actuated by such an instinct of friendliness , that it was truly beautiful to behold .
melville	typee	not a single female took part in this employment : and if the degree of consideration in which the ever-adorable sex is held by the men be -- as the philosophers affirm -- a just criterion of the degree of refinement among a people , then i may truly pronounce the typees to be as polished a community as ever the sun shone upon . the religious restrictions of the taboo alone excepted , the women of the valley were allowed every possible indulgence . nowhere are the ladies more assiduously courted ; nowhere are they better appreciated as the contributors to our highest enjoyments ; and nowhere are they more sensible of their power . far different from their condition among many rude nations , where the women are made to perform all the work while their ungallant lords and masters lie buried in sloth , the gentle sex in the valley of typee were exempt from toil , if toil it might be called that , even in the tropical climate , never distilled one drop of perspiration . their light household occupations , together with the manufacture of tappa , the platting of mats , and the polishing of drinking-vessels , were the only employments pertaining to the women . and even these resembled those pleasant avocations which fill up the elegant morning leisure of our fashionable ladies at home . but in these occupations , slight and agreeable though they were , the giddy young girls very seldom engaged . indeed these wilful care-killing damsels were averse to all useful employment .
melville	typee	like so many spoiled beauties , they ranged through the groves -- bathed in the stream -- danced -- flirted -- played all manner of mischievous pranks , and passed their days in one merry round of thoughtless happiness . during my whole stay on the island i never witnessed a single quarrel , nor anything that in the slightest degree approached even to a dispute . the natives appeared to form one household , whose members were bound together by the ties of strong affection . the love of kindred i did not so much perceive , for it seemed blended in the general love ; and where all were treated as brothers and sisters , it was hard to tell who were actually related to each other by blood .
melville	typee	let it not be supposed that i have overdrawn this picture . i have not done so . nor let it be urged , that the hostility of this tribe to foreigners , and the hereditary feuds they carry on against their fellow-islanders beyond the mountains , are facts which contradict me . not so ; these apparent discrepancies are easily reconciled . by many a legendary tale of violence and wrong , as well as by events which have passed before their eyes , these people have been taught to look upon white men with abhorrence . the cruel invasion of their country by porter has alone furnished them with ample provocation ; and i can sympathize in the spirit which prompts the typee warrior to guard all the passes to his valley with the point of his levelled spear , and , standing upon the beach , with his back turned upon his green home , to hold at bay the intruding european .
melville	typee	as to the origin of the enmity of this particular clan towards the neighbouring tribes , i can not so confidently speak . i will not say that their foes are the aggressors , nor will i endeavour to palliate their conduct . but surely , if our evil passions must find vent , it is far better to expend them on strangers and aliens , than in the bosom of the community in which we dwell . in many polished countries civil contentions , as well as domestic enmities , are prevalent , and the same time that the most atrocious foreign wars are waged . how much less guilty , then , are our islanders , who of these three sins are only chargeable with one , and that the least criminal !
melville	typee	the reader will ere long have reason to suspect that the typees are not free from the guilt of cannibalism ; and he will then , perhaps , charge me with admiring a people against whom so odious a crime is chargeable . but this only enormity in their character is not half so horrible as it is usually described . according to the popular fictions , the crews of vessels , shipwrecked on some barbarous coast , are eaten alive like so many dainty joints by the uncivil inhabitants ; and unfortunate voyagers are lured into smiling and treacherous bays ; knocked on the head with outlandish war-clubs ; and served up without any prelimary dressing . in truth , so horrific and improbable are these accounts , that many sensible and well-informed people will not believe that any cannibals exist ; and place every book of voyages which purports to give any account of them , on the same shelf with blue beard and jack the giant-killer . while others , implicitly crediting the most extravagant fictions , firmly believe that there are people in the world with tastes so depraved that they would infinitely prefer a single mouthful of material humanity to a good dinner of roast beef and plum pudding . but here , truth , who loves to be centrally located , is again found between the two extremes ; for cannibalism to a certain moderate extent is practised among several of the primitive tribes in the pacific , but it is upon the bodies of slain enemies alone , and horrible and fearful as the custom is , immeasurably as it is to be abhorred and condemned , still i assert that those who indulge in it are in other respects humane and virtuous .
melville	typee	chapter twenty-eight fishing parties -- mode of distributing the fish -- midnight banquet -- time-keeping tapers -- unceremonious style of eating the fish there was no instance in which the social and kindly dispositions of the typees were more forcibly evinced than in the manner the conducted their great fishing parties . four times during my stay in the valley the young men assembled near the full of the moon , and went together on these excursions . as they were generally absent about forty-eight hours , i was led to believe that they went out towards the open sea , some distance from the bay . the polynesians seldom use a hook and line , almost always employing large well-made nets , most ingeniously fabricated from the twisted fibres of a certain bark . i examined several of them which had been spread to dry upon the beach at nukuheva . they resemble very much our own seines , and i should think they were nearly as durable .
melville	typee	all the south sea islanders are passionately fond of fish ; but none of them can be more so than the inhabitants of typee . i could not comprehend , therefore , why they so seldom sought it in their waters , for it was only at stated times that the fishing parties were formed , and these occasions were always looked forward to with no small degree of interest .
melville	typee	during their absence the whole population of the place were in a ferment , and nothing was talked of but ‘ pehee , pehee ’ ( fish , fish ) . towards the time when they were expected to return the vocal telegraph was put into operation -- the inhabitants , who were scattered throughout the length of the valley , leaped upon rocks and into trees , shouting with delight at the thoughts of the anticipated treat . as soon as the approach of the party was announced , there was a general rush of the men towards the beach ; some of them remaining , however , about the ti in order to get matters in readiness for the reception of the fish , which were brought to the taboo groves in immense packages of leaves , each one of them being suspended from a pole carried on the shoulders of two men .
melville	typee	i was present at the ti on one of these occasions , and the sight was most interesting . after all the packages had arrived , they were laid in a row under the verandah of the building and opened .
melville	typee	the fish were all quite small , generally about the size of a herring , and of every variety . about one-eighth of the whole being reserved for the use of the ti itself , the remainder was divided into numerous smaller packages , which were immediately dispatched in every direction to the remotest parts of the valley . arrived at their destination , these were in turn portioned out , and equally distributed among the various houses of each particular district . the fish were under a strict taboo , until the distribution was completed , which seemed to be effected in the most impartial manner . by the operation of this system every man , woman , and child in the vale , were at one and the same time partaking of this favourite article of food .
melville	typee	once i remember the party arrived at midnight ; but the unseasonableness of the tour did not repress the impatience of the islanders . the carriers dispatched from the ti were to be seen hurrying in all directions through the deep groves ; each individual preceded by a boy bearing a flaming torch of dried cocoanut boughs , which from time to time was replenished from the materials scattered along the path . the wild glare of these enormous flambeaux , lighting up with a startling brilliancy the innermost recesses of the vale , and seen moving rapidly along beneath the canopy of leaves , the savage shout of the excited messengers sounding the news of their approach , which was answered on all sides , and the strange appearance of their naked bodies , seen against the gloomy background , produced altogether an effect upon my mind that i shall long remember .
melville	typee	it was on this same occasion that kory-kory awakened me at the dead hour of night , and in a sort of transport communicated the intelligence contained in the words ‘ pehee perni ’ ( fish come ) . as i happened to have been in a remarkably sound and refreshing slumber , i could not imagine why the information had not been deferred until morning , indeed , i felt very much inclined to fly into a passion and box my valet ’ s ears ; but on second thoughts i got quietly up , and on going outside the house was not a little interested by the moving illumination which i beheld .
melville	typee	when old marheyo received his share of the spoils , immediate preparations were made for a midnight banquet ; calabashes of poee-poee were filled to the brim ; green bread-fruit were roasted ; and a huge cake of ‘ amar ’ was cut up with a sliver of bamboo and laid out on an immense banana-leaf .
melville	typee	at this supper we were lighted by several of the native tapers , held in the hands of young girls . these tapers are most ingeniously made . there is a nut abounding in the valley , called by the typees ‘ armor ’ , closely resembling our common horse-chestnut . the shell is broken , and the contents extracted whole . any number of these are strung at pleasure upon the long elastic fibre that traverses the branches of the cocoanut tree . some of these tapers are eight or ten feet in length ; but being perfectly flexible , one end is held in a coil , while the other is lighted . the nut burns with a fitful bluish flame , and the oil that it contains is exhausted in about ten minutes . as one burns down , the next becomes ignited , and the ashes of the former are knocked into a cocoanut shell kept for the purpose . this primitive candle requires continual attention , and must be constantly held in the hand . the person so employed marks the lapse of time by the number of nuts consumed , which is easily learned by counting the bits of tappa distributed at regular intervals along the string .
melville	typee	i grieve to state so distressing a fact , but the inhabitants of typee were in the habit of devouring fish much in the same way that a civilized being would eat a radish , and without any more previous preparation . they eat it raw ; scales , bones , gills , and all the inside . the fish is held by the tail , and the head being introduced into the mouth , the animal disappears with a rapidity that would at first nearly lead one to imagine it had been launched bodily down the throat .
melville	typee	raw fish ! shall i ever forget my sensations when i first saw my island beauty devour one . oh , heavens ! fayaway , how could you ever have contracted so vile a habit ? however , after the first shock had subsided , the custom grew less odious in my eyes , and i soon accustomed myself to the sight . let no one imagine , however , that the lovely fayaway was in the habit of swallowing great vulgar-looking fishes : oh , no ; with her beautiful small hand she would clasp a delicate , little , golden-hued love of a fish and eat it as elegantly and as innocently as though it were a naples biscuit . but alas ! it was after all a raw fish ; and all i can say is , that fayaway ate it in a more ladylike manner than any other girl of the valley .
melville	typee	when at rome do as the romans do , i held to be so good a proverb , that being in typee i made a point of doing as the typees did . thus i ate poee-poee as they did ; i walked about in a garb striking for its simplicity ; and i reposed on a community of couches ; besides doing many other things in conformity with their peculiar habits ; but the farthest i ever went in the way of conformity , was on several occasions to regale myself with raw fish . these being remarkably tender , and quite small , the undertaking was not so disagreeable in the main , and after a few trials i positively began to relish them ; however , i subjected them to a slight operation with a knife previously to making my repast .
melville	typee	chapter twenty-nine natural history of the valley -- golden lizards -- tameness of the birds -- mosquitoes -- flies -- dogs -- a solitary cat -- the climate -- the cocoanut tree -- singular modes of climbing it -- an agile young chief -- fearlessness of the children -- too-too and the cocoanut tree -- the birds of the valley
melville	typee	i think i must enlighten the reader a little about the natural history of the valley . whence , in the name of count buffon and baron cuvier , came those dogs that i saw in typee ? dogs ! -- big hairless rats rather ; all with smooth , shining speckled hides -- fat sides , and very disagreeable faces . whence could they have come ? that they were not the indigenous production of the region , i am firmly convinced . indeed they seemed aware of their being interlopers , looking fairly ashamed , and always trying to hide themselves in some dark corner . it was plain enough they did not feel at home in the vale -- that they wished themselves well out of it , and back to the ugly country from which they must have come .
melville	typee	scurvy curs ! they were my abhorrence ; i should have liked nothing better than to have been the death of every one of them . in fact , on one occasion , i intimated the propriety of a canine crusade to mehevi ; but the benevolent king would not consent to it . he heard me very patiently ; but when i had finished , shook his head , and told me in confidence that they were ‘ taboo ’ .
melville	typee	as for the animal that made the fortune of the ex-lord-mayor whittington , i shall never forget the day that i was lying in the house about noon , everybody else being fast asleep ; and happening to raise my eyes , met those of a big black spectral cat , which sat erect in the doorway , looking at me with its frightful goggling green orbs , like one of those monstrous imps that torment some of teniers ’ saints ! i am one of those unfortunate persons to whom the sight of these animals are , at any time an insufferable annoyance .
melville	typee	thus constitutionally averse to cats in general , the unexpected apparition of this one in particular utterly confounded me . when i had a little recovered from the fascination of its glance , i started up ; the cat fled , and emboldened by this , i rushed out of the house in pursuit ; but it had disappeared . it was the only time i ever saw one in the valley , and how it got there i can not imagine . it is just possible that it might have escaped from one of the ships at nukuheva . it was in vain to seek information on the subject from the natives , since none of them had seen the animal , the appearance of which remains a mystery to me to this day .
melville	typee	among the few animals which are to be met with in typee , there was none which i looked upon with more interest than a beautiful golden-hued species of lizard . it measured perhaps five inches from head to tail , and was most gracefully proportioned . numbers of those creatures were to be seen basking in the sunshine upon the thatching of the houses , and multitudes at all hours of the day showed their glittering sides as they ran frolicking between the spears of grass or raced in troops up and down the tall shafts of the cocoanut trees . but the remarkable beauty of these little animals and their lively ways were not their only claims upon my admiration . they were perfectly tame and insensible to fear . frequently , after seating myself upon the ground in some shady place during the heat of the day , i would be completely overrun with them . if i brushed one off my arm , it would leap perhaps into my hair : when i tried to frighten it away by gently pinching its leg , it would turn for protection to the very hand that attacked it .
melville	typee	the birds are also remarkably tame . if you happened to see one perched upon a branch within reach of your arm , and advanced towards it , it did not fly away immediately , but waited quietly looking at you , until you could almost touch it , and then took wing slowly , less alarmed at your presence , it would seem , than desirous of removing itself from your path . had salt been less scarce in the valley than it was , this was the very place to have gone birding with it . i remember that once , on an uninhabited island of the gallipagos , a bird alighted on my outstretched arm , while its mate chirped from an adjoining tree . its tameness , far from shocking me , as a similar occurrence did selkirk , imparted to me the most exquisite thrill of delight i ever experienced , and with somewhat of the same pleasure did i afterwards behold the birds and lizards of the valley show their confidence in the kindliness of man .
melville	typee	among the numerous afflictions which the europeans have entailed upon some of the natives of the south seas , is the accidental introduction among them of that enemy of all repose and ruffler of even tempers -- the mosquito . at the sandwich islands and at two or three of the society group , there are now thriving colonies of these insects , who promise ere long to supplant altogether the aboriginal sand-flies . they sting , buzz , and torment , from one end of the year to the other , and by incessantly exasperating the natives materially obstruct the benevolent labours of the missionaries .
melville	typee	from this grievous visitation , however the typees are as yet wholly exempt ; but its place is unfortunately in some degree supplied by the occasional presence of a minute species of fly , which , without stinging , is nevertheless productive of no little annoyance . the tameness of the birds and lizards is as nothing when compared to the fearless confidence of this insect . he will perch upon one of your eye-lashes , and go to roost there if you do not disturb him , or force his way through your hair , or along the cavity of the nostril , till you almost fancy he is resolved to explore the very brain itself . on one occasion i was so inconsiderate as to yawn while a number of them were hovering around me . i never repeated the act . some half-dozen darted into the open apartment , and began walking about its ceiling ; the sensation was dreadful . i involuntarily closed my mouth , and the poor creatures being enveloped in inner darkness , must in their consternation have stumbled over my palate , and been precipitated into the gulf beneath . at any rate , though i afterwards charitably held my mouth open for at least five minutes , with a view of affording egress to the stragglers , none of them ever availed themselves of the opportunity .
melville	typee	there are no wild animals of any kind on the island unless it be decided that the natives themselves are such . the mountains and the interior present to the eye nothing but silent solitudes , unbroken by the roar of beasts of prey , and enlivened by few tokens even of minute animated existence . there are no venomous reptiles , and no snakes of any description to be found in any of the valleys .
melville	typee	in a company of marquesan natives the weather affords no topic of conversation . it can hardly be said to have any vicissitudes . the rainy season , it is true , brings frequent showers , but they are intermitting and refreshing . when an islander bound on some expedition rises from his couch in the morning , he is never solicitous to peep out and see how the sky looks , or ascertain from what quarter the wind blows . he is always sure of a ‘ fine day ’ , and the promise of a few genial showers he hails with pleasure . there is never any of that ‘ remarkable weather ’ on the islands which from time immemorial has been experienced in america , and still continues to call forth the wondering conversational exclamations of its elderly citizens . nor do there even occur any of those eccentric meteorological changes which elsewhere surprise us . in the valley of typee ice-creams would never be rendered less acceptable by sudden frosts , nor would picnic parties be deferred on account of inauspicious snowstorms : for there day follows day in one unvarying round of summer and sunshine , and the whole year is one long tropical month of june just melting into july .
melville	typee	it is this genial climate which causes the cocoanuts to flourish as they do . this invaluable fruit , brought to perfection by the rich soil of the marquesas , and home aloft on a stately column more than a hundred feet from the ground , would seem at first almost inaccessible to the simple natives . indeed the slender , smooth , and soaring shaft , without a single limb or protuberance of any kind to assist one in mounting it , presents an obstacle only to be overcome by the surprising agility and ingenuity of the islanders . it might be supposed that their indolence would lead them patiently to await the period when the ripened nuts , slowly parting from their stems , fall one by one to the ground . this certainly would be the case , were it not that the young fruit , encased in a soft green husk , with the incipient meat adhering in a jelly-like pellicle to its sides , and containing a bumper of the most delicious nectar , is what they chiefly prize . they have at least twenty different terms to express as many progressive stages in the growth of the nut . many of them reject the fruit altogether except at a particular period of its growth , which , incredible as it may appear , they seemed to me to be able to ascertain within an hour or two . others are still more capricious in their tastes ; and after gathering together a heap of the nuts of all ages , and ingeniously tapping them , will first sip from one and then from another , as fastidiously as some delicate wine-bibber experimenting glass in hand among his dusty demi-johns of different vintages .
melville	typee	some of the young men , with more flexible frames than their comrades , and perhaps with more courageous souls , had a way of walking up the trunk of the cocoanut trees which to me seemed little less than miraculous ; and when looking at them in the act , i experienced that curious perplexity a child feels when he beholds a fly moving feet uppermost along a ceiling .
melville	typee	i will endeavour to describe the way in which narnee , a noble young chief , sometimes performed this feat for my peculiar gratification ; but his preliminary performances must also be recorded . upon my signifying my desire that he should pluck me the young fruit of some particular tree , the handsome savage , throwing himself into a sudden attitude of surprise , feigns astonishment at the apparent absurdity of the request . maintaining this position for a moment , the strange emotions depicted on his countenance soften down into one of humorous resignation to my will , and then looking wistfully up to the tufted top of the tree , he stands on tip-toe , straining his neck and elevating his arm , as though endeavouring to reach the fruit from the ground where he stands . as if defeated in this childish attempt , he now sinks to the earth despondingly , beating his breast in well-acted despair ; and then , starting to his feet all at once , and throwing back his head , raises both hands , like a school-boy about to catch a falling ball . after continuing this for a moment or two , as if in expectation that the fruit was going to be tossed down to him by some good spirit in the tree-top , he turns wildly round in another fit of despair , and scampers off to the distance of thirty or forty yards . here he remains awhile , eyeing the tree , the very picture of misery ; but the next moment , receiving , as it were , a flash of inspiration , he rushes again towards it , and clasping both arms about the trunk , with one elevated a little above the other , he presses the soles of his feet close together against the tree , extending his legs from it until they are nearly horizontal , and his body becomes doubled into an arch ; then , hand over hand and foot over foot , he rises from the earth with steady rapidity , and almost before you are aware of it , has gained the cradled and embowered nest of nuts , and with boisterous glee flings the fruit to the ground .
melville	typee	this mode of walking the tree is only practicable where the trunk declines considerably from the perpendicular . this , however , is almost always the case ; some of the perfectly straight shafts of the trees leaning at an angle of thirty degrees .
melville	typee	the less active among the men , and many of the children of the valley have another method of climbing . they take a broad and stout piece of bark , and secure each end of it to their ankles , so that when the feet thus confined are extended apart , a space of little more than twelve inches is left between them . this contrivance greatly facilitates the act of climbing . the band pressed against the tree , and closely embracing it , yields a pretty firm support ; while with the arms clasped about the trunk , and at regular intervals sustaining the body , the feet are drawn up nearly a yard at a time , and a corresponding elevation of the hands immediately succeeds . in this way i have seen little children , scarcely five years of age , fearlessly climbing the slender pole of a young cocoanut tree , and while hanging perhaps fifty feet from the ground , receiving the plaudits of their parents beneath , who clapped their hands , and encouraged them to mount still higher .
melville	typee	what , thought i , on first witnessing one of these exhibitions , would the nervous mothers of america and england say to a similar display of hardihood in any of their children ? the lacedemonian nation might have approved of it , but most modern dames would have gone into hysterics at the sight .
melville	typee	at the top of the cocoanut tree the numerous branches , radiating on all sides from a common centre , form a sort of green and waving basket , between the leaflets of which you just discern the nuts thickly clustering together , and on the loftier trees looking no bigger from the ground than bunches of grapes . i remember one adventurous little fellow -- too-too was the rascal ’ s name -- who had built himself a sort of aerial baby-house in the picturesque tuft of a tree adjoining marheyo ’ s habitation . he used to spend hours there , -- rustling among the branches , and shouting with delight every time the strong gusts of wind rushing down from the mountain side , swayed to and fro the tall and flexible column on which he was perched . whenever i heard too-too ’ s musical voice sounding strangely to the ear from so great a height , and beheld him peeping down upon me from out his leafy covert , he always recalled to my mind dibdin ’ s lines --
melville	typee	‘ there ’ s a sweet little cherub that sits up aloft , to look out for the life of poor jack. ’ birds -- bright and beautiful birds -- fly over the valley of typee . you see them perched aloft among the immovable boughs of the majestic bread-fruit trees , or gently swaying on the elastic branches of the omoo ; skimming over the palmetto thatching of the bamboo huts ; passing like spirits on the wing through the shadows of the grove , and sometimes descending into the bosom of the valley in gleaming flights from the mountains . their plumage is purple and azure , crimson and white , black and gold ; with bills of every tint : bright bloody red , jet black , and ivory white , and their eyes are bright and sparkling ; they go sailing through the air in starry throngs ; but , alas ! the spell of dumbness is upon them all -- there is not a single warbler in the valley !
melville	typee	i know not why it was , but the sight of these birds , generally the ministers of gladness , always oppressed me with melancholy . as in their dumb beauty they hovered by me whilst i was walking , or looked down upon me with steady curious eyes from out the foliage , i was almost inclined to fancy that they knew they were gazing upon a stranger , and that they commiserated his fate .
melville	typee	chapter thirty a professor of the fine arts -- his persecutions -- something about tattooing and tabooing -- two anecdotes in illustration of the latter -- a few thoughts on the typee dialect in one of my strolls with kory-kory , in passing along the border of a thick growth of bushes , my attention was arrested by a singular noise . on entering the thicket i witnessed for the first time the operation of tattooing as performed by these islanders .
melville	typee	i beheld a man extended flat upon his back on the ground , and , despite the forced composure of his countenance , it was evident that he was suffering agony . his tormentor bent over him , working away for all the world like a stone-cutter with mallet and chisel . in one hand he held a short slender stick , pointed with a shark ’ s tooth , on the upright end of which he tapped with a small hammer-like piece of wood , thus puncturing the skin , and charging it with the colouring matter in which the instrument was dipped . a cocoanut shell containing this fluid was placed upon the ground . it is prepared by mixing with a vegetable juice the ashes of the ‘ armor ’ , or candle-nut , always preserved for the purpose . beside the savage , and spread out upon a piece of soiled tappa , were a great number of curious black-looking little implements of bone and wood , used in the various divisions of his art . a few terminated in a single fine point , and , like very delicate pencils , were employed in giving the finishing touches , or in operating upon the more sensitive portions of the body , as was the case in the present instance . others presented several points distributed in a line , somewhat resembling the teeth of a saw . these were employed in the coarser parts of the work , and particularly in pricking in straight marks . some presented their points disposed in small figures , and being placed upon the body , were , by a single blow of the hammer , made to leave their indelible impression . i observed a few the handles of which were mysteriously curved , as if intended to be introduced into the orifice of the ear , with a view perhaps of beating the tattoo upon the tympanum . altogether the sight of these strange instruments recalled to mind that display of cruel-looking mother-of-pearl-handled things which one sees in their velvet-lined cases at the elbow of a dentist .
melville	typee	the artist was not at this time engaged on an original sketch , his subject being a venerable savage , whose tattooing had become somewhat faded with age and needed a few repairs , and accordingly he was merely employed in touching up the works of some of the old masters of the typee school , as delineated upon the human canvas before him . the parts operated upon were the eyelids , where a longitudinal streak , like the one which adorned kory-kory , crossed the countenance of the victim .
melville	typee	in spite of all the efforts of the poor old man , sundry twitchings and screwings of the muscles of the face denoted the exquisite sensibility of these shutters to the windows of his soul , which he was now having repainted . but the artist , with a heart as callous as that of an army surgeon , continued his performance , enlivening his labours with a wild chant , tapping away the while as merrily as a woodpecker .
melville	typee	so deeply engaged was he in his work , that he had not observed our approach , until , after having , enjoyed an unmolested view of the operation , i chose to attract his attention . as soon as he perceived me , supposing that i sought him in his professional capacity , he seized hold of me in a paroxysm of delight , and was an eagerness to begin the work . when , however , i gave him to understand that he had altogether mistaken my views , nothing could exceed his grief and disappointment . but recovering from this , he seemed determined not to credit my assertion , and grasping his implements , he flourished them about in fearful vicinity to my face , going through an imaginary performance of his art , and every moment bursting into some admiring exclamation at the beauty of his designs .
melville	typee	horrified at the bare thought of being rendered hideous for life if the wretch were to execute his purpose upon me , i struggled to get away from him , while kory-kory , turning traitor , stood by , and besought me to comply with the outrageous request . on my reiterated refusals the excited artist got half beside himself , and was overwhelmed with sorrow at losing so noble an opportunity of distinguishing himself in his profession .
melville	typee	the idea of engrafting his tattooing upon my white skin filled him with all a painter ’ s enthusiasm ; again and again he gazed into my countenance , and every fresh glimpse seemed to add to the vehemence of his ambition . not knowing to what extremities he might proceed , and shuddering at the ruin he might inflict upon my figure-head , i now endeavoured to draw off his attention from it , and holding out my arm in a fit of desperation , signed to him to commence operations . but he rejected the compromise indignantly , and still continued his attack on my face , as though nothing short of that would satisfy him . when his forefinger swept across my features , in laying out the borders of those parallel bands which were to encircle my countenance , the flesh fairly crawled upon my bones . at last , half wild with terror and indignation , i succeeded in breaking away from the three savages , and fled towards old marheyo ’ s house , pursued by the indomitable artist , who ran after me , implements in hand . kory-kory , however , at last interfered and drew him off from the chase .
melville	typee	this incident opened my eyes to a new danger ; and i now felt convinced that in some luckless hour i should be disfigured in such a manner as never more to have the face to return to my countrymen , even should an opportunity offer .
melville	typee	these apprehensions were greatly increased by the desire which king mehevi and several of the inferior chiefs now manifested that i should be tattooed . the pleasure of the king was first signified to me some three days after my casual encounter with karky the artist . heavens ! what imprecations i showered upon that karky . doubtless he had plotted a conspiracy against me and my countenance , and would never rest until his diabolical purpose was accomplished . several times i met him in various parts of the valley , and , invariably , whenever he descried me , he came running after me with his mallet and chisel , flourishing them about my face as if he longed to begin . what an object he would have made of me !
melville	typee	when the king first expressed his wish to me , i made known to him my utter abhorrence of the measure , and worked myself into such a state of excitement , that he absolutely stared at me in amazement . it evidently surpassed his majesty ’ s comprehension how any sober-minded and sensible individual could entertain the least possible objection to so beautifying an operation .
melville	typee	soon afterwards he repeated his suggestion , and meeting with a little repulse , showed some symptoms of displeasure at my obduracy . on his a third time renewing his request , i plainly perceived that something must be done , or my visage was ruined for ever ; i therefore screwed up my courage to the sticking point , and declared my willingness to have both arms tattooed from just above the wrist to the shoulder . his majesty was greatly pleased at the proposition , and i was congratulating myself with having thus compromised the matter , when he intimated that as a thing of course my face was first to undergo the operation . i was fairly driven to despair ; nothing but the utter ruin of my ‘ face divine ’ , as the poets call it , would , i perceived , satisfy the inexorable mehevi and his chiefs , or rather , that infernal karky , for he was at the bottom of it all .
melville	typee	the only consolation afforded me was a choice of patterns : i was at perfect liberty to have my face spanned by three horizontal bars , after the fashion of my serving-man ’ s ; or to have as many oblique stripes slanting across it ; or if , like a true courtier , i chose to model my style on that of royalty , i might wear a sort of freemason badge upon my countenance in the shape of a mystic triangle . however , i would have none of these , though the king most earnestly impressed upon my mind that my choice was wholly unrestricted . at last , seeing my unconquerable repugnance , he ceased to importune me .
melville	typee	but not so some other of the savages . hardly a day passed but i was subjected to their annoying requests , until at last my existence became a burden to me ; the pleasures i had previously enjoyed no longer afforded me delight , and all my former desire to escape from the valley now revived with additional force .
melville	typee	a fact which i soon afterwards learned augmented my apprehension . the whole system of tattooing was , i found , connected with their religion ; and it was evident , therefore , that they were resolved to make a convert of me .
melville	typee	in the decoration of the chiefs it seems to be necessary to exercise the most elaborate pencilling ; while some of the inferior natives looked as if they had been daubed over indiscriminately with a house-painter ’ s brush . i remember one fellow who prided himself hugely upon a great oblong patch , placed high upon his back , and who always reminded me of a man with a blister of spanish flies , stuck between his shoulders . another whom i frequently met had the hollow of his eyes tattooed in two regular squares and his visual organs being remarkably brilliant , they gleamed forth from out this setting like a couple of diamonds inserted in ebony .
melville	typee	although convinced that tattooing was a religious observance , still the nature of the connection between it and the superstitious idolatry of the people was a point upon which i could never obtain any information . like the still more important system of the ‘ taboo ’ , it always appeared inexplicable to me .
melville	typee	there is a marked similarity , almost an identity , between the religious institutions of most of the polynesian islands , and in all exists the mysterious ‘ taboo ’ , restricted in its uses to a greater or less extent . so strange and complex in its arrangements is this remarkable system , that i have in several cases met with individuals who , after residing for years among the islands in the pacific , and acquiring a considerable knowledge of the language , have nevertheless been altogether unable to give any satisfactory account of its operations . situated as i was in the typee valley , i perceived every hour the effects of this all-controlling power , without in the least comprehending it . those effects were , indeed , wide-spread and universal , pervading the most important as well as the minutest transactions of life . the savage , in short , lives in the continual observance of its dictates , which guide and control every action of his being .
melville	typee	for several days after entering the valley i had been saluted at least fifty times in the twenty-four hours with the talismanic word ‘ taboo ’ shrieked in my ears , at some gross violation of its provisions , of which i had unconsciously been guilty . the day after our arrival i happened to hand some tobacco to toby over the head of a native who sat between us . he started up , as if stung by an adder ; while the whole company , manifesting an equal degree of horror , simultaneously screamed out ‘ taboo ! ’ i never again perpetrated a similar piece of ill-manners , which , indeed , was forbidden by the canons of good breeding , as well as by the mandates of the taboo . but it was not always so easy to perceive wherein you had contravened the spirit of this institution . i was many times called to order , if i may use the phrase , when i could not for the life of me conjecture what particular offence i had committed .
melville	typee	one day i was strolling through a secluded portion of the valley , and hearing the musical sound of the cloth-mallet at a little distance , i turned down a path that conducted me in a few moments to a house where there were some half-dozen girls employed in making tappa . this was an operation i had frequently witnessed , and had handled the bark in all the various stages of its preparation . on the present occasion the females were intent upon their occupation , and after looking up and talking gaily to me for a few moments , they resumed their employment . i regarded them for a while in silence , and then carelessly picking up a handful of the material that lay around , proceeded unconsciously to pick it apart . while thus engaged , i was suddenly startled by a scream , like that of a whole boarding-school of young ladies just on the point of going into hysterics . leaping up with the idea of seeing a score of happar warriors about to perform anew the sabine atrocity , i found myself confronted by the company of girls , who , having dropped their work , stood before me with starting eyes , swelling bosoms , and fingers pointed in horror towards me .
melville	typee	thinking that some venomous reptile must be concealed in the bark which i held in my hand , i began cautiously to separate and examine it . whilst i did so the horrified girls re-doubled their shrieks . their wild cries and frightened motions actually alarmed me , and throwing down the tappa , i was about to rush from the house , when in the same instant their clamours ceased , and one of them , seizing me by the arm , pointed to the broken fibres that had just fallen from my grasp , and screamed in my ears the fatal word taboo !
melville	typee	i subsequently found out that the fabric they were engaged in making was of a peculiar kind , destined to be worn on the heads of the females , and through every stage of its manufacture was guarded by a rigorous taboo , which interdicted the whole masculine gender from even so much as touching it .
melville	typee	frequently in walking through the groves i observed bread-fruit and cocoanut trees , with a wreath of leaves twined in a peculiar fashion about their trunks . this was the mark of the taboo . the trees themselves , their fruit , and even the shadows they cast upon the ground , were consecrated by its presence . in the same way a pipe , which the king had bestowed upon me , was rendered sacred in the eyes of the natives , none of whom could i ever prevail upon to smoke from it . the bowl was encircled by a woven band of grass , somewhat resembling those turks ’ heads occasionally worked in the handles of our whip-stalks .
melville	typee	a similar badge was once braided about my wrist by the royal hand of mehevi himself , who , as soon as he had concluded the operation , pronounced me ‘ taboo ’ . this occurred shortly after toby ’ s disappearance ; and , were it not that from the first moment i had entered the valley the natives had treated me with uniform kindness , i should have supposed that their conduct afterwards was to be ascribed to the fact that i had received this sacred investiture .
melville	typee	the capricious operations of the taboo are not its least remarkable feature : to enumerate them all would be impossible . black hogs -- infants to a certain age -- women in an interesting situation -- young men while the operation of tattooing their faces is going on -- and certain parts of the valley during the continuance of a shower -- are alike fenced about by the operation of the taboo .
melville	typee	i witnessed a striking instance of its effects in the bay of tior , my visit to which place has been alluded to in a former part of this narrative . on that occasion our worthy captain formed one of the party . he was a most insatiable sportsman . outward bound , and off the pitch of cape horn , he used to sit on the taffrail , and keep the steward loading three or four old fowling pieces , with which he would bring down albatrosses , cape pigeons , jays , petrels , and divers other marine fowl , who followed chattering in our wake . the sailors were struck aghast at his impiety , and one and all attributed our forty days ’ beating about that horrid headland to his sacrilegious slaughter of these inoffensive birds .
melville	typee	at tior he evinced the same disregard for the religious prejudices of the islanders , as he had previously shown for the superstitions of the sailors . having heard that there were a considerable number of fowls in the valley the progeny of some cocks and hens accidentally left there by an english vessel , and which , being strictly tabooed , flew about almost in a wild state -- he determined to break through all restraints , and be the death of them . accordingly , he provided himself with a most formidable looking gun , and announced his landing on the beach by shooting down a noble cock that was crowing what proved to be his own funeral dirge , on the limb of an adjoining tree . ‘ taboo ’ , shrieked the affrighted savages . ‘ oh , hang your taboo , ’ says the nautical sportsman ; ‘ talk taboo to the marines ’ ; and bang went the piece again , and down came another victim . at this the natives ran scampering through the groves , horror-struck at the enormity of the act .
melville	typee	all that afternoon the rocky sides of the valley rang with successive reports , and the superb plumage of many a beautiful fowl was ruffled by the fatal bullet . had it not been that the french admiral , with a large party , was then in the glen , i have no doubt that the natives , although their tribe was small and dispirited , would have inflicted summary vengeance upon the man who thus outraged their most sacred institutions ; as it was , they contrived to annoy him not a little .
melville	typee	thirsting with his exertions , the skipper directed his steps to a stream ; but the savages , who had followed at a little distance , perceiving his object , rushed towards him and forced him away from its bank -- his lips would have polluted it . wearied at last , he sought to enter a house that he might rest for a while on the mats ; its inmates gathered tumultuously about the door and denied him admittance . he coaxed and blustered by turns , but in vain ; the natives were neither to be intimidated nor appeased , and as a final resort he was obliged to call together his boat ’ s crew , and pull away from what he termed the most infernal place he ever stepped upon .
melville	typee	lucky was it for him and for us that we were not honoured on our departure by a salute of stones from the hands of the exasperated tiors . in this way , on the neighbouring island of ropo , were killed , but a few weeks previously , and for a nearly similar offence , the master and three of the crew of the k -- - .
melville	typee	i can not determine with anything approaching to certainty , what power it is that imposes the taboo . when i consider the slight disparity of condition among the islanders -- the very limited and inconsiderable prerogatives of the king and chiefs -- and the loose and indefinite functions of the priesthood , most of whom were hardly to be distinguished from the rest of their countrymen , i am wholly at a loss where to look for the authority which regulates this potent institution . it is imposed upon something today , and withdrawn tomorrow ; while its operations in other cases are perpetual . sometimes its restrictions only affect a single individual -- sometimes a particular family -- sometimes a whole tribe ; and in a few instances they extend not merely over the various clans on a single island , but over all the inhabitants of an entire group . in illustration of this latter peculiarity , i may cite the law which forbids a female to enter a canoe -- a prohibition which prevails upon all the northern marquesas islands .
melville	typee	the word itself ( taboo ) is used in more than one signification . it is sometimes used by a parent to his child , when in the exercise of parental authority he forbids it to perform a particular action . anything opposed to the ordinary customs of the islanders , although not expressly prohibited , is said to be ‘ taboo ’ .
melville	typee	the typee language is one very difficult to be acquired ; it bears a close resemblance to the other polynesian dialects , all of which show a common origin . the duplication of words , as ‘ lumee lumee ’ , ‘ poee poee ’ , ‘ muee muee ’ , is one of their peculiar features . but another , and a more annoying one , is the different senses in which one and the same word is employed ; its various meanings all have a certain connection , which only makes the matter more puzzling . so one brisk , lively little word is obliged , like a servant in a poor family , to perform all sorts of duties ; for instance , one particular combination of syllables expresses the ideas of sleep , rest , reclining , sitting , leaning , and all other things anywise analogous thereto , the particular meaning being shown chiefly by a variety of gestures and the eloquent expression of the countenance .
melville	typee	the intricacy of these dialects is another peculiarity . in the missionary college at lahainaluna , on mowee , one of the sandwich islands , i saw a tabular exhibition of a hawiian verb , conjugated through all its moods and tenses . it covered the side of a considerable apartment , and i doubt whether sir william jones himself would not have despaired of mastering it .
melville	typee	chapter thirty-one strange custom of the islanders -- their chanting , and the peculiarity of their voice -- rapture of the king at first hearing a song -- a new dignity conferred on the author -- musical instruments in the valley -- admiration of the savages at beholding a pugilistic performance -- swimming infant -- beautiful tresses of the girls -- ointment for the hair
melville	typee	sadly discursive as i have already been , i must still further entreat the reader ’ s patience , as i am about to string together , without any attempt at order , a few odds and ends of things not hitherto mentioned , but which are either curious in themselves or peculiar to the typees .
melville	typee	there was one singular custom observed in old marheyo ’ s domestic establishment , which often excited my surprise . every night , before retiring , the inmates of the house gathered together on the mats , and so squatting upon their haunches , after the universal practice of these islanders , would commence a low , dismal and monotonous chant , accompanying the voice with the instrumental melody produced by two small half-rotten sticks tapped slowly together , a pair of which were held in the hands of each person present . thus would they employ themselves for an hour or two , sometimes longer . lying in the gloom which wrapped the further end of the house , i could not avoid looking at them , although the spectacle suggested nothing but unpleasant reflection . the flickering rays of the ‘ armor ’ nut just served to reveal their savage lineaments , without dispelling the darkness that hovered about them .
melville	typee	sometimes when , after falling into a kind of doze , and awaking suddenly in the midst of these doleful chantings , my eye would fall upon the wild-looking group engaged in their strange occupation , with their naked tattooed limbs , and shaven heads disposed in a circle , i was almost tempted to believe that i gazed upon a set of evil beings in the act of working at a frightful incantation .
melville	typee	what was the meaning or purpose of this custom , whether it was practiced merely as a diversion , or whether it was a religious exercise , a sort of family prayers , i never could discover .
melville	typee	the sounds produced by the natives on these occasions were of a most singular description ; and had i not actually been present , i never would have believed that such curious noises could have been produced by human beings .
melville	typee	to savages generally is imputed a guttural articulation . this however , is not always the case , especially among the inhabitants of the polynesian archipelago . the labial melody with which the typee girls carry on an ordinary conversation , giving a musical prolongation to the final syllable of every sentence , and chirping out some of the words with a liquid , bird-like accent , was singularly pleasing .
melville	typee	the men however , are not quite so harmonious in their utterance , and when excited upon any subject , would work themselves up into a sort of wordy paroxysm , during which all descriptions of rough-sided sounds were projected from their mouths , with a force and rapidity which was absolutely astonishing .
melville	typee	. . . . . . . . although these savages are remarkably fond of chanting , still they appear to have no idea whatever of singing , at least as the art is practised in other nations .
melville	typee	i shall never forget the first time i happened to roar out a stave in the presence of noble mehevi . it was a stanza from the ‘ bavarian broom-seller ’ . his typeean majesty , with all his court , gazed upon me in amazement , as if i had displayed some preternatural faculty which heaven had denied to them . the king was delighted with the verse ; but the chorus fairly transported him . at his solicitation i sang it again and again , and nothing could be more ludicrous than his vain attempts to catch the air and the words . the royal savage seemed to think that by screwing all the features of his face into the end of his nose he might possibly succeed in the undertaking , but it failed to answer the purpose ; and in the end he gave it up , and consoled himself by listening to my repetition of the sounds fifty times over .
melville	typee	previous to mehevi ’ s making the discovery , i had never been aware that there was anything of the nightingale about me ; but i was now promoted to the place of court-minstrel , in which capacity i was afterwards perpetually called upon to officiate .
melville	typee	. . . . . . . . besides the sticks and the drums , there are no other musical instruments among the typees , except one which might appropriately be denominated a nasal flute . it is somewhat longer than an ordinary fife ; is made of a beautiful scarlet-coloured reed ; and has four or five stops , with a large hole near one end , which latter is held just beneath the left nostril . the other nostril being closed by a peculiar movement of the muscles about the nose , the breath is forced into the tube , and produces a soft dulcet sound which is varied by the fingers running at random over the stops . this is a favourite recreation with the females and one in which fayaway greatly excelled . awkward as such an instrument may appear , it was , in fayaway ’ s delicate little hands , one of the most graceful i have ever seen . a young lady , in the act of tormenting a guitar strung about her neck by a couple of yards of blue ribbon , is not half so engaging .
melville	typee	. . . . . . . . singing was not the only means i possessed of diverting the royal mehevi and his easy-going subject . nothing afforded them more pleasure than to see me go through the attitude of pugilistic encounter . as not one of the natives had soul enough in him to stand up like a man , and allow me to hammer away at him , for my own personal gratification and that of the king , i was necessitated to fight with an imaginary enemy , whom i invariably made to knock under to my superior prowess . sometimes when this sorely battered shadow retreated precipitately towards a group of the savages , and , following him up , i rushed among them dealing my blows right and left , they would disperse in all directions much to the enjoyment of mehevi , the chiefs , and themselves .
melville	typee	the noble art of self-defence appeared to be regarded by them as the peculiar gift of the white man ; and i make little doubt that they supposed armies of europeans were drawn up provided with nothing else but bony fists and stout hearts , with which they set to in column , and pummelled one another at the word of command .
melville	typee	. . . . . . . . one day , in company with kory-kory , i had repaired to the stream for the purpose of bathing , when i observed a woman sitting upon a rock in the midst of the current , and watching with the liveliest interest the gambols of something , which at first i took to be an uncommonly large species of frog that was sporting in the water near her . attracted by the novelty of the sight , i waded towards the spot where she sat , and could hardly credit the evidence of my senses when i beheld a little infant , the period of whose birth could not have extended back many days , paddling about as if it had just risen to the surface , after being hatched into existence at the bottom . occasionally , the delighted parent reached out her hand towards it , when the little thing , uttering a faint cry , and striking out its tiny limbs , would sidle for the rock , and the next moment be clasped to its mother ’ s bosom . this was repeated again and again , the baby remaining in the stream about a minute at a time . once or twice it made wry faces at swallowing a mouthful of water , and choked a spluttered as if on the point of strangling . at such times however , the mother snatched it up and by a process scarcely to be mentioned obliged it to eject the fluid . for several weeks afterwards i observed this woman bringing her child down to the stream regularly every day , in the cool of the morning and evening and treating it to a bath . no wonder that the south sea islanders are so amphibious a race , when they are thus launched into the water as soon as they see the light . i am convinced that it is as natural for a human being to swim as it is for a duck . and yet in civilized communities how many able-bodied individuals die , like so many drowning kittens , from the occurrence of the most trivial accidents !
melville	typee	. . . . . . . . the long luxuriant and glossy tresses of the typee damsels often attracted my admiration . a fine head of hair is the pride and joy of every woman ’ s heart . whether against the express will of providence , it is twisted upon the crown of the head and there coiled away like a rope on a ship ’ s deck ; whether it be stuck behind the ears and hangs down like the swag of a small window-curtain ; or whether it be permitted to flow over the shoulders in natural ringlets , it is always the pride of the owner , and the glory of the toilette .
melville	typee	the typee girls devote much of their time to the dressing of their fair and redundant locks . after bathing , as they sometimes do five or six times every day , the hair is carefully dried , and if they have been in the sea , invariably washed in fresh water , and anointed with a highly scented oil extracted from the meat of the cocoanut . this oil is obtained in great abundance by the following very simple process :
melville	typee	a large vessel of wood , with holes perforated in the bottom , is filled with the pounded meat , and exposed to the rays of the sun . as the oleaginous matter exudes , it falls in drops through the apertures into a wide-mouthed calabash placed underneath . after a sufficient quantity has thus been collected , the oil undergoes a purifying process , and is then poured into the small spherical shells of the nuts of the moo-tree , which are hollowed out to receive it . these nuts are then hermetically sealed with a resinous gum , and the vegetable fragrance of their green rind soon imparts to the oil a delightful odour . after the lapse of a few weeks the exterior shell of the nuts becomes quite dry and hard , and assumes a beautiful carnation tint ; and when opened they are found to be about two-thirds full of an ointment of a light yellow colour and diffusing the sweetest perfume . this elegant little odorous globe would not be out of place even upon the toilette of a queen . its merits as a preparation for the hair are undeniable -- it imparts to it a superb gloss and a silky fineness .
melville	typee	chapter thirty-two apprehensions of evil -- frightful discovery -- some remarks on cannibalism -- second battle with the happars -- savage spectacle -- mysterious feast -- subsequent disclosures from the time of my casual encounter with karky the artist , my life was one of absolute wretchedness . not a day passed but i was persecuted by the solicitations of some of the natives to subject myself to the odious operation of tattooing . their importunities drove me half wild , for i felt how easily they might work their will upon me regarding this or anything else which they took into their heads . still , however , the behaviour of the islanders towards me was as kind as ever . fayaway was quite as engaging ; kory-kory as devoted ; and mehevi the king just as gracious and condescending as before . but i had now been three months in their valley , as nearly as i could estimate ; i had grown familiar with the narrow limits to which my wandering had been confined ; and i began bitterly to feel the state of captivity in which i was held . there was no one with whom i could freely converse ; no one to whom i could communicate my thoughts ; no one who could sympathize with my sufferings . a thousand times i thought how much more endurable would have been my lot had toby still been with me . but i was left alone , and the thought was terrible to me . still , despite my griefs , i did all in my power to appear composed and cheerful , well knowing that by manifesting any uneasiness , or any desire to escape , i should only frustrate my object .
melville	typee	it was during the period i was in this unhappy frame of mind that the painful malady under which i had been labouring -- after having almost completely subsided -- began again to show itself , and with symptoms as violent as ever . this added calamity nearly unmanned me ; the recurrence of the complaint proved that without powerful remedial applications all hope of cure was futile ; and when i reflected that just beyond the elevations , which bound me in , was the medical relief i needed , and that although so near , it was impossible for me to avail myself of it , the thought was misery .
melville	typee	in this wretched situation , every circumstance which evinced the savage nature of the beings at whose mercy i was , augmented the fearful apprehensions that consumed me . an occurrence which happened about this time affected me most powerfully .
melville	typee	i have already mentioned that from the ridge-pole of marheyo ’ s house were suspended a number of packages enveloped in tappa . many of these i had often seen in the hands of the natives , and their contents had been examined in my presence . but there were three packages hanging very nearly over the place where i lay , which from their remarkable appearance had often excited my curiosity . several times i had asked kory-kory to show me their contents , but my servitor , who , in almost every other particular had acceded to my wishes , refused to gratify me in this .
melville	typee	one day , returning unexpectedly from the ‘ ti ’ , my arrival seemed to throw the inmates of the house into the greatest confusion . they were seated together on the mats , and by the lines which extended from the roof to the floor i immediately perceived that the mysterious packages were for some purpose or another under inspection . the evident alarm the savages betrayed filled me with forebodings of evil , and with an uncontrollable desire to penetrate the secret so jealously guarded . despite the efforts of marheyo and kory-kory to restrain me , i forced my way into the midst of the circle , and just caught a glimpse of three human heads , which others of the party were hurriedly enveloping in the coverings from which they had been taken .
melville	typee	one of the three i distinctly saw . it was in a state of perfect preservation , and from the slight glimpse i had of it , seemed to have been subjected to some smoking operation which had reduced it to the dry , hard , and mummy-like appearance it presented . the two long scalp locks were twisted up into balls upon the crown of the head in the same way that the individual had worn them during life . the sunken cheeks were rendered yet more ghastly by the rows of glistening teeth which protruded from between the lips , while the sockets of the eyes -- filled with oval bits of mother-of-pearl shell , with a black spot in the centre -- heightened the hideousness of its aspect .
melville	typee	two of the three were heads of the islanders ; but the third , to my horror , was that of a white man . although it had been quickly removed from my sight , still the glimpse i had of it was enough to convince me that i could not be mistaken .
melville	typee	gracious god ! what dreadful thoughts entered my head ; in solving this mystery perhaps i had solved another , and the fate of my lost companion might be revealed in the shocking spectacle i had just witnessed . i longed to have torn off the folds of cloth and satisfied the awful doubts under which i laboured . but before i had recovered from the consternation into which i had been thrown , the fatal packages were hoisted aloft , and once more swung over my head . the natives now gathered round me tumultuously , and laboured to convince me that what i had just seen were the heads of three happar warriors , who had been slain in battle . this glaring falsehood added to my alarm , and it was not until i reflected that i had observed the packages swinging from their elevation before toby ’ s disappearance , that i could at all recover my composure .
melville	typee	but although this horrible apprehension had been dispelled , i had discovered enough to fill me , in my present state of mind , with the most bitter reflections . it was plain that i had seen the last relic of some unfortunate wretch , who must have been massacred on the beach by the savages , in one of those perilous trading adventures which i have before described .
melville	typee	it was not , however , alone the murder of the stranger that overcame me with gloom . i shuddered at the idea of the subsequent fate his inanimate body might have met with . was the same doom reserved for me ? was i destined to perish like him -- like him perhaps , to be devoured and my head to be preserved as a fearful memento of the events ? my imagination ran riot in these horrid speculations , and i felt certain that the worst possible evils would befall me . but whatever were my misgivings , i studiously concealed them from the islanders , as well as the full extent of the discovery i had made .
melville	typee	although the assurances which the typees had often given me , that they never eat human flesh , had not convinced me that such was the case , yet , having been so long a time in the valley without witnessing anything which indicated the existence of the practice , i began to hope that it was an event of very rare occurrence , and that i should be spared the horror of witnessing it during my stay among them : but , alas , these hopes were soon destroyed .
melville	typee	it is a singular fact , that in all our accounts of cannibal tribes we have seldom received the testimony of an eye-witness account to this revolting practice . the horrible conclusion has almost always been derived from the second-hand evidence of europeans , or else from the admissions of the savages themselves , after they have in some degree become civilized . the polynesians are aware of the detestation in which europeans hold this custom , and therefore invariably deny its existence , and with the craft peculiar to savages , endeavour to conceal every trace of it .
melville	typee	the excessive unwillingness betrayed by the sandwich islanders , even at the present day , to allude to the unhappy fate of cook , has often been remarked . and so well have they succeeded in covering the event with mystery , that to this very hour , despite all that has been said and written on the subject , it still remains doubtful whether they wreaked upon his murdered body the vengeance they sometimes inflicted upon their enemies .
melville	typee	at kealakekau , the scene of that tragedy , a strip of ship ’ s copper nailed against an upright post in the ground used to inform the traveller that beneath reposed the ‘ remains ’ of the great circumnavigator . but i am strongly inclined to believe not only the corpse was refused christian burial , but that the heart which was brought to vancouver some time after the event , and which the hawaiians stoutly maintained was that of captain cook , was no such thing ; and that the whole affair was a piece of imposture which was sought to be palmed off upon the credulous englishman .
melville	typee	a few years since there was living on the island of maui ( one of the sandwich group ) an old chief , who , actuated by a morbid desire for notoriety , gave himself out among the foreign residents of the place as the living tomb of captain cook ’ s big toe ! -- affirming that at the cannibal entertainment which ensued after the lamented briton ’ s death , that particular portion of his body had fallen to his share . his indignant countrymen actually caused him to be prosecuted in the native courts , on a charge nearly equivalent to what we term defamation of character ; but the old fellow persisting in his assertion , and no invalidating proof being adduced , the plaintiffs were cast in the suit , and the cannibal reputation of the defendant firmly established . this result was the making of his fortune ; ever afterwards he was in the habit of giving very profitable audiences to all curious travellers who were desirous of beholding the man who had eaten the great navigator ’ s great toe .
melville	typee	about a week after my discovery of the contents of the mysterious packages , i happened to be at the ti , when another war-alarm was sounded , and the natives rushing to their arms , sallied out to resist a second incursion of the happar invaders . the same scene was again repeated , only that on this occasion i heard at least fifteen reports of muskets from the mountains during the time that the skirmish lasted . an hour or two after its termination , loud paeans chanted through the valley announced the approach of the victors . i stood with kory-kory leaning against the railing of the pi-pi awaiting their advance , when a tumultuous crowd of islanders emerged with wild clamours from the neighbouring groves . in the midst of them marched four men , one preceding the other at regular intervals of eight or ten feet , with poles of a corresponding length , extending from shoulder to shoulder , to which were lashed with thongs of bark three long narrow bundles , carefully wrapped in ample coverings of freshly plucked palm-leaves , tacked together with slivers of bamboo . here and there upon these green winding-sheets might be seen the stains of blood , while the warriors who carried the frightful burdens displayed upon their naked limbs similar sanguinary marks . the shaven head of the foremost had a deep gash upon it , and the clotted gore which had flowed from the wound remained in dry patches around it . the savage seemed to be sinking under the weight he bore . the bright tattooing upon his body was covered with blood and dust ; his inflamed eyes rolled in their sockets , and his whole appearance denoted extraordinary suffering and exertion ; yet sustained by some powerful impulse , he continued to advance , while the throng around him with wild cheers sought to encourage him . the other three men were marked about the arms and breasts with several slight wounds , which they somewhat ostentatiously displayed .
melville	typee	these four individuals , having been the most active in the late encounter , claimed the honour of bearing the bodies of their slain enemies to the ti . such was the conclusion i drew from my own observations , and , as far as i could understand , from the explanation which kory-kory gave me .
melville	typee	the royal mehevi walked by the side of these heroes . he carried in one hand a musket , from the barrel of which was suspended a small canvas pouch of powder , and in the other he grasped a short javelin , which he held before him and regarded with fierce exultation . this javelin he had wrested from a celebrated champion of the happars , who had ignominiously fled , and was pursued by his foes beyond the summit of the mountain .
melville	typee	when within a short distance of the ti , the warrior with the wounded head , who proved to be narmonee , tottered forward two or three steps , and fell helplessly to the ground ; but not before another had caught the end of the pole from his shoulder , and placed it upon his own .
melville	typee	the excited throng of islanders , who surrounded the person of the king and the dead bodies of the enemy , approached the spot where i stood , brandishing their rude implements of warfare , many of which were bruised and broken , and uttering continual shouts of triumph . when the crowd drew up opposite the ti , i set myself to watch their proceedings most attentively ; but scarcely had they halted when my servitor , who had left my side for an instant , touched my arm and proposed our returning to marheyo ’ s house . to this i objected ; but , to my surprise , kory-kory reiterated his request , and with an unusual vehemence of manner . still , however , i refused to comply , and was retreating before him , as in his importunity he pressed upon me , when i felt a heavy hand laid upon my shoulder , and turning round , encountered the bulky form of mow-mow , a one-eyed chief , who had just detached himself from the crowd below , and had mounted the rear of the pi-pi upon which we stood . his cheek had been pierced by the point of a spear , and the wound imparted a still more frightful expression to his hideously tattooed face , already deformed by the loss of an eye . the warrior , without uttering a syllable , pointed fiercely in the direction of marheyo ’ s house , while kory-kory , at the same time presenting his back , desired me to mount .
melville	typee	i declined this offer , but intimated my willingness to withdraw , and moved slowly along the piazza , wondering what could be the cause of this unusual treatment . a few minutes ’ consideration convinced me that the savages were about to celebrate some hideous rite in connection with their peculiar customs , and at which they were determined i should not be present . i descended from the pi-pi , and attended by kory-kory , who on this occasion did not show his usual commiseration for my lameness , but seemed only anxious to hurry me on , walked away from the place . as i passed through the noisy throng , which by this time completely environed the ti , i looked with fearful curiosity at the three packages , which now were deposited upon the ground ; but although i had no doubt as to their contents , still their thick coverings prevented my actually detecting the form of a human body .
melville	typee	the next morning , shortly after sunrise , the same thundering sounds which had awakened me from sleep on the second day of the feast of calabashes , assured me that the savages were on the eve of celebrating another , and , as i fully believed , a horrible solemnity .
melville	typee	all the inmates of the house , with the exception of marheyo , his son , and tinor , after assuming their gala dresses , departed in the direction of the taboo groves . although i did not anticipate a compliance with my request , still , with a view of testing the truth of my suspicions , i proposed to kory-kory that , according to our usual custom in the morning , we should take a stroll to the ti : he positively refused ; and when i renewed the request , he evinced his determination to prevent my going there ; and , to divert my mind from the subject , he offered to accompany me to the stream . we accordingly went , and bathed . on our coming back to the house , i was surprised to find that all its inmates had returned , and were lounging upon the mats as usual , although the drums still sounded from the groves .
melville	typee	the rest of the day i spent with kory-kory and fayaway , wandering about a part of the valley situated in an opposite direction from the ti , and whenever i so much as looked towards that building , although it was hidden from view by intervening trees , and at the distance of more than a mile , my attendant would exclaim , ‘ taboo , taboo ! ’
melville	typee	at the various houses where we stopped , i found many of the inhabitants reclining at their ease , or pursuing some light occupation , as if nothing unusual were going forward ; but amongst them all i did not perceive a single chief or warrior . when i asked several of the people why they were not at the ‘ hoolah hoolah ’ ( the feast ) , their uniformly answered the question in a manner which implied that it was not intended for them , but for mehevi , narmonee , mow-mow , kolor , womonoo , kalow , running over , in their desire to make me comprehend their meaning , the names of all the principal chiefs .
melville	typee	everything , in short , strengthened my suspicions with regard to the nature of the festival they were now celebrating ; and which amounted almost to a certainty . while in nukuheva i had frequently been informed that the whole tribe were never present at these cannibal banquets , but the chiefs and priests only ; and everything i now observed agreed with the account .
melville	typee	the sound of the drums continued without intermission the whole day , and falling continually upon my ear , caused me a sensation of horror which i am unable to describe . on the following day , hearing none of those noisy indications of revelry , i concluded that the inhuman feast was terminated ; and feeling a kind of morbid curiosity to discover whether the ti might furnish any evidence of what had taken place there , i proposed to kory-kory to walk there . to this proposition he replied by pointing with his finger to the newly risen sun , and then up to the zenith , intimating that our visit must be deferred until noon . shortly after that hour we accordingly proceeded to the taboo groves , and as soon as we entered their precincts , i looked fearfully round in , quest of some memorial of the scene which had so lately been acted there ; but everything appeared as usual . on reaching the ti , we found mehevi and a few chiefs reclining on the mats , who gave me as friendly a reception as ever . no allusions of any kind were made by them to the recent events ; and i refrained , for obvious reasons , from referring to them myself .
melville	typee	after staying a short time i took my leave . in passing along the piazza , previously to descending from the pi-pi , i observed a curiously carved vessel of wood , of considerable size , with a cover placed over it , of the same material , and which resembled in shape a small canoe . it was surrounded by a low railing of bamboos , the top of which was scarcely a foot from the ground . as the vessel had been placed in its present position since my last visit , i at once concluded that it must have some connection with the recent festival , and , prompted by a curiosity i could not repress , in passing it i raised one end of the cover ; at the same moment the chiefs , perceiving my design , loudly ejaculated , ‘ taboo ! taboo ! ’
melville	typee	but the slight glimpse sufficed ; my eyes fell upon the disordered members of a human skeleton , the bones still fresh with moisture , and with particles of flesh clinging to them here and there !
melville	typee	kory-kory , who had been a little in advance of me , attracted by the exclamations of the chiefs , turned round in time to witness the expression of horror on my countenance . he now hurried towards me , pointing at the same time to the canoe , and exclaiming rapidly , ‘ puarkee ! puarkee ! ’ ( pig , pig ) . i pretended to yield to the deception , and repeated the words after him several times , as though acquiescing in what he said . the other savages , either deceived by my conduct or unwilling to manifest their displeasure at what could not now be remedied , took no further notice of the occurrence , and i immediately left the ti .
melville	typee	all that night i lay awake , revolving in my mind the fearful situation in which i was placed . the last horrid revelation had now been made , and the full sense of my condition rushed upon my mind with a force i had never before experienced .
melville	typee	where , thought i , desponding , is there the slightest prospect of escape ? the only person who seemed to possess the ability to assist me was the stranger marnoo ; but would he ever return to the valley ? and if he did , should i be permitted to hold any communication with him ? it seemed as if i were cut off from every source of hope , and that nothing remained but passively to await whatever fate was in store for me . a thousand times i endeavoured to account for the mysterious conduct of the natives .
melville	typee	for what conceivable purpose did they thus retain me a captive ? what could be their object in treating me with such apparent kindness , and did it not cover some treacherous scheme ? or , if they had no other design than to hold me a prisoner , how should i be able to pass away my days in this narrow valley , deprived of all intercourse with civilized beings , and for ever separated from friends and home ?
melville	typee	one only hope remained to me . the french could not long defer a visit to the bay , and if they should permanently locate any of their troops in the valley , the savages could not for any length of time conceal my existence from them . but what reason had i to suppose that i should be spared until such an event occurred , an event which might be postponed by a hundred different contingencies ?
melville	typee	chapter thirty-three the stranger again arrives in the valley -- singular interview with him -- attempt to escape -- failure -- melancholy situation -- sympathy of marheyo ‘ marnoo , marnoo pemi ! ’ such were the welcome sounds which fell upon my ear some ten days after the events related in the preceding chapter . once more the approach of the stranger was heralded , and the intelligence operated upon me like magic . again i should be able to converse with him in my own language ; and i resolve at all hazards to concert with him some scheme , however desperate , to rescue me from a condition that had now become insupportable .
melville	typee	as he drew near , i remembered with many misgivings the inauspicious termination of our former interview , and when he entered the house , i watched with intense anxiety the reception he met with from its inmates . to my joy , his appearance was hailed with the liveliest pleasure ; and accosting me kindly , he seated himself by my side , and entered into conversation with the natives around him . it soon appeared however , that on this occasion he had not any intelligence of importance to communicate . i inquired of him from whence he had just come ? he replied from pueearka , his native valley , and that he intended to return to it the same day .
melville	typee	at once it struck me that , could i but reach that valley under his protection , i might easily from thence reach nukuheva by water ; and animated by the prospect which this plan held , out i disclosed it in a few brief words to the stranger , and asked him how it could be best accomplished . my heart sunk within me , when in his broken english he answered me that it could never be effected . ‘ kanaka no let you go nowhere , ’ he said ; ‘ you taboo . why you no like to stay ? plenty moee-moee ( sleep ) -- plenty ki-ki ( eat ) -- plenty wahenee ( young girls ) -- oh , very good place typee ! suppose you no like this bay , why you come ? you no hear about typee ? all white men afraid typee , so no white men come . ’
melville	typee	these words distressed me beyond belief ; and when i had again related to him the circumstances under which i had descended into the valley , and sought to enlist his sympathies in my behalf by appealing to the bodily misery i had endure , he listened with impatience , and cut me short by exclaiming passionately , ‘ me no hear you talk any more ; by by kanaka get mad , kill you and me too . no you see he no want you to speak at all ? -- you see -- ah ! by by you no mind -- you get well , he kill you , eat you , hang you head up there , like happar kanaka. -- now you listen -- but no talk any more . by by i go ; -- you see way i go -- ah ! then some night kanaka all moee-moee ( sleep ) -- you run away , you come pueearka . i speak pueearka kanaka -- he no harm you -- ah ! then i take you my canoe nukuheva -- and you run away ship no more. ’ with these words , enforced by a vehemence of gesture i can not describe , marnoo started from my side , and immediately engaged in conversation with some of the chiefs who had entered the house .
melville	typee	it would have been idle for me to have attempted resuming the interview so peremptorily terminated by marnoo , who was evidently little disposed to compromise his own safety by any rash endeavour to ensure mine . but the plan he had suggested struck me as one which might possibly be accomplished , and i resolved to act upon it as speedily as possible .
melville	typee	accordingly , when he arose to depart , i accompanied him with the natives outside of the house , with a view of carefully noting the path he would take in leaving the valley . just before leaping from the pi-pi he clasped my hand , and looking significantly at me , exclaimed , ‘ now you see -- you do what i tell you -- ah ! then you do good ; -- you no do so -- ah ! then you die. ’ the next moment he waved his spear to the islanders , and following the route that conducted to a defile in the mountains lying opposite the happar side , was soon out of sight .
melville	typee	a mode of escape was now presented to me , but how was i to avail myself of it ? i was continually surrounded by the savages ; i could not stir from one house to another without being attended by some of them ; and even during the hours devoted to slumber , the slightest movement which i made seemed to attract the notice of those who shared the mats with me . in spite of these obstacles , however , i determined forthwith to make the attempt . to do so with any prospect of success , it was necessary that i should have at least two hours start before the islanders should discover my absence ; for with such facility was any alarm spread through the valley , and so familiar , of course , were the inhabitants with the intricacies of the groves , that i could not hope , lame and feeble as i was , and ignorant of the route , to secure my escape unless i had this advantage . it was also by night alone that i could hope to accomplish my object , and then only by adopting the utmost precaution .
melville	typee	the entrance to marheyo ’ s habitation was through a low narrow opening in its wicker-work front . this passage , for no conceivable reason that i could devise , was always closed after the household had retired to rest , by drawing a heavy slide across it , composed of a dozen or more bits of wood , ingeniously fastened together by seizings of sinnate . when any of the inmates chose to go outside , the noise occasioned by the removing of this rude door awakened every body else ; and on more than one occasion i had remarked that the islanders were nearly as irritable as more civilized beings under similar circumstances .
melville	typee	the difficulty thus placed in my way i , determined to obviate in the following manner . i would get up boldly in the course of the night , and drawing the slide , issue from the house , and pretend that my object was merely to procure a drink from the calabash , which always stood without the dwelling on the corner of the pi-pi . on re-entering i would purposely omit closing the passage after me , and trusting that the indolence of the savages would prevent them from repairing my neglect , would return to my mat , and waiting patiently until all were again asleep , i would then steal forth , and at once take the route to pueearka .
melville	typee	the very night which followed marnoo ’ s departure , i proceeded to put this project into execution . about midnight , as i imagined , i arose and drew the slide . the natives , just as i had expected , started up , while some of them asked , ‘ arware poo awa , tommo ? ’ ( where are you going , tommo ? ) ‘ wai ’ ( water ) i laconically answered , grasping the calabash . on hearing my reply they sank back again , and in a minute or two i returned to my mat , anxiously awaiting the result of the experiment .
melville	typee	one after another the savages , turning restlessly , appeared to resume their slumbers , and rejoicing at the stillness which prevailed , i was about to rise again from my couch , when i heard a slight rustling -- a dark form was intercepted between me and the doorway -- the slide was drawn across it , and the individual , whoever he was , returned to his mat . this was a sad blow to me ; but as it might have aroused the suspicions of the islanders to have made another attempt that night , i was reluctantly obliged to defer it until the next . several times after i repeated the same manoeuvre , but with as little success as before . as my pretence for withdrawing from the house was to allay my thirst , kory-kory either suspecting some design on my part , or else prompted by a desire to please me , regularly every evening placed a calabash of water by my side .
melville	typee	even , under these inauspicious circumstances i again and again renewed the attempt , but when i did so , my valet always rose with me , as if determined i should not remove myself from his observation . for the present , therefore , i was obliged to abandon the attempt ; but i endeavoured to console myself with the idea that by this mode i might yet effect my escape .
melville	typee	shortly after marnoo ’ s visit i was reduced to such a state that it was with extreme difficulty i could walk , even with the assistance of a spear , and kory-kory , as formerly , was obliged to carry me daily to the stream .
melville	typee	for hours and hours during the warmest part of the day i lay upon my mat , and while those around me were nearly all dozing away in careless ease , i remained awake , gloomily pondering over the fate which it appeared now idle for me to resist , when i thought of the loved friends who were thousands and thousands of miles from the savage island in which i was held a captive , when i reflected that my dreadful fate would for ever be concealed from them , and that with hope deferred they might continue to await my return long after my inanimate form had blended with the dust of the valley -- i could not repress a shudder of anguish .
melville	typee	how vividly is impressed upon my mind every minute feature of the scene which met my view during those long days of suffering and sorrow . at my request my mats were always spread directly facing the door , opposite which , and at a little distance , was the hut of boughs that marheyo was building .
melville	typee	whenever my gentle fayaway and kory-kory , laying themselves down beside me , would leave me awhile to uninterrupted repose , i took a strange interest in the slightest movements of the eccentric old warrior . all alone during the stillness of the tropical mid-day , he would pursue his quiet work , sitting in the shade and weaving together the leaflets of his cocoanut branches , or rolling upon his knee the twisted fibres of bark to form the cords with which he tied together the thatching of his tiny house . frequently suspending his employment , and noticing my melancholy eye fixed upon him , he would raise his hand with a gesture expressive of deep commiseration , and then moving towards me slowly , would enter on tip-toes , fearful of disturbing the slumbering natives , and , taking the fan from my hand , would sit before me , swaying it gently to and fro , and gazing earnestly into my face .
melville	typee	just beyond the pi-pi , and disposed in a triangle before the entrance of the house , were three magnificent bread-fruit trees . at this moment i can recap to my mind their slender shafts , and the graceful inequalities of their bark , on which my eye was accustomed to dwell day after day in the midst of my solitary musings . it is strange how inanimate objects will twine themselves into our affections , especially in the hour of affliction . even now , amidst all the bustle and stir of the proud and busy city in which i am dwelling , the image of those three trees seems to come as vividly before my eyes as if they were actually present , and i still feel the soothing quiet pleasure which i then had in watching hour after hour their topmost boughs waving gracefully in the breeze .
melville	typee	chapter thirty-four the escape nearly three weeks had elapsed since the second visit of marnoo , and it must have been more than four months since i entered the valley , when one day about noon , and whilst everything was in profound silence , mow-mow , the one-eyed chief , suddenly appeared at the door , and leaning towards me as i lay directly facing him , said in a low tone , ‘ toby pemi ena ’ ( toby has arrived here ) . gracious heaven ! what a tumult of emotions rushed upon me at this startling intelligence ! insensible to the pain that had before distracted me , i leaped to my feet , and called wildly to kory-kory who was reposing by my side . the startled islanders sprang from their mats ; the news was quickly communicated to them ; and the next moment i was making my way to the ti on the back of kory-kory ; and surrounded by the excited savages .
melville	typee	all that i could comprehend of the particulars which mow-mow rehearsed to his audience as we proceeded , was that my long-lost companion had arrived in a boat which had just entered the bay . these tidings made me most anxious to be carried at once to the sea , lest some untoward circumstance should prevent our meeting ; but to this they would not consent , and continued their course towards the royal abode . as we approached it , mehevi and several chiefs showed themselves from the piazza , and called upon us loudly to come to them .
melville	typee	as soon as we had approached , i endeavoured to make them understand that i was going down to the sea to meet toby . to this the king objected , and motioned kory-kory to bring me into the house . it was in vain to resist ; and in a few moments i found myself within the ti , surrounded by a noisy group engaged in discussing the recent intelligence . toby ’ s name was frequently repeated , coupled with violent exclamations of astonishment . it seemed as if they yet remained in doubt with regard to the fact of his arrival , at at every fresh report that was brought from the shore they betrayed the liveliest emotions .
melville	typee	almost frenzied at being held in this state of suspense , i passionately besought mehevi to permit me to proceed . whether my companion had arrived or not , i felt a presentiment that my own fate was about to be decided . again and again i renewed my petition to mehevi . he regarded me with a fixed and serious eye , but at length yielding to my importunity , reluctantly granted my request .
melville	typee	accompanied by some fifty of the natives , i now rapidly continued my journey ; every few moments being transferred from the back of one to another , and urging my bearer forward all the while with earnest entreaties . as i thus hurried forward , no doubt as to the truth of the information i had received ever crossed my mind .
melville	typee	i was alive only to the one overwhelming idea , that a chance of deliverance was now afforded me , if the jealous opposition of the savages could be overcome . having been prohibited from approaching the sea during the whole of my stay in the valley , i had always associated with it the idea of escape . toby too -- if indeed he had ever voluntarily deserted me -- must have effected this flight by the sea ; and now that i was drawing near to it myself , i indulged in hopes which i had never felt before . it was evident that a boat had entered the bay , and i saw little reason to doubt the truth of the report that it had brought my companion . every time therefore that we gained an elevation , i looked eagerly around , hoping to behold him . in the midst of an excited throng , who by their violent gestures and wild cries appeared to be under the influence of some excitement as strong as my own , i was now borne along at a rapid trot , frequently stooping my head to avoid the branches which crossed the path , and never ceasing to implore those who carried me to accelerate their already swift pace .
melville	typee	in this manner we had proceeded about four or five miles , when we were met by a party of some twenty islanders , between whom and those who accompanied me ensued an animated conference . impatient of the delay occasioned by this interruption , i was beseeching the man who carried me to proceed without his loitering companions , when kory-kory , running to my side , informed me , in three fatal words , that the news had all proved , false -- that toby had not arrived -- ‘ toby owlee pemi ’ . heaven only knows how , in the state of mind and body i then was , i ever sustained the agony which this intelligence caused me ; not that the news was altogether unexpected ; but i had trusted that the fact might not have been made known until we should have arrived upon the beach . as it was , i at once foresaw the course the savages would pursue . they had only yielded thus far to my entreaties , that i might give a joyful welcome to my long-lost comrade ; but now that it was known he had not arrived they would at once oblige me to turn back .
melville	typee	my anticipations were but too correct . in spite of the resistance i made , they carried me into a house which was near the spot , and left me upon the mats . shortly afterwards several of those who had accompanied me from the ti , detaching themselves from the others , proceeded in the direction of the sea . those who remained -- among whom were marheyo , mow-mow , kory-kory , and tinor -- gathered about the dwelling , and appeared to be awaiting their return .
melville	typee	this convinced me that strangers -- perhaps some of my own countrymen -- had for some cause or other entered the bay . distracted at the idea of their vicinity , and reckless of the pain which i suffered , i heeded not the assurances of the islanders , that there were no boats at the beach , but starting to my feet endeavoured to gain the door . instantly the passage was blocked up by several men , who commanded me to resume my seat . the fierce looks of the irritated savages admonished me that i could gain nothing by force , and that it was by entreaty alone that i could hope to compass my object .
melville	typee	guided by this consideration , i turned to mow-mow , the only chief present whom i had been much in the habit of seeing , and carefully concealing , my real design , tried to make him comprehend that i still believed toby to have arrived on the shore , and besought him to allow me to go forward to welcome him .
melville	typee	to all his repeated assertions , that my companion had not been seen , i pretended to turn a deaf ear , while i urged my solicitations with an eloquence of gesture which the one-eyed chief appeared unable to resist . he seemed indeed to regard me as a forward child , to whose wishes he had not the heart to oppose force , and whom he must consequently humour . he spoke a few words to the natives , who at once retreated from the door , and i immediately passed out of the house .
melville	typee	here i looked earnestly round for kory-kory ; but that hitherto faithful servitor was nowhere to be seen . unwilling to linger even for a single instant when every moment might be so important , i motioned to a muscular fellow near me to take me upon his back ; to my surprise he angrily refused . i turned to another , but with a like result . a third attempt was as unsuccessful , and i immediately perceived what had induced mow-mow to grant my request , and why the other natives conducted themselves in so strange a manner . it was evident that the chief had only given me liberty to continue my progress towards the sea , because he supposed that i was deprived of the means of reaching it .
melville	typee	convinced by this of their determination to retain me a captive , i became desperate ; and almost insensible to the pain which i suffered , i seized a spear which was leaning against the projecting eaves of the house , and supporting myself with it , resumed the path that swept by the dwelling . to my surprise , i was suffered to proceed alone ; all the natives remaining in front of the house , and engaging in earnest conversation , which every moment became more loud and vehement ; and to my unspeakable delight , i perceived that some difference of opinion had arisen between them ; that two parties , in short , were formed , and consequently that in their divided counsels there was some chance of my deliverance .
melville	typee	before i had proceeded a hundred yards i was again surrounded by the savages , who were still in all the heat of argument , and appeared every moment as if they would come to blows . in the midst of this tumult old marheyo came to my side , and i shall never forget the benevolent expression of his countenance . he placed his arm upon my shoulder , and emphatically pronounced the only two english words i had taught him ‘ home ’ and ‘ mother ’ . i at once understood what he meant , and eagerly expressed my thanks to him . fayaway and kory-kory were by his side , both weeping violently ; and it was not until the old man had twice repeated the command that his son could bring himself to obey him , and take me again upon his back . the one-eyed chief opposed his doing so , but he was overruled , and , as it seemed to me , by some of his own party .
melville	typee	we proceeded onwards , and never shall i forget the ecstasy i felt when i first heard the roar of the surf breaking upon the beach . before long i saw the flashing billows themselves through the opening between the trees . oh glorious sight and sound of ocean ! with what rapture did i hail you as familiar friends ! by this time the shouts of the crowd upon the beach were distinctly audible , and in the blended confusion of sounds i almost fancied i could distinguish the voices of my own countrymen .
melville	typee	when we reached the open space which lay between the groves and the sea , the first object that met my view was an english whale-boat , lying with her bow pointed from the shore , and only a few fathoms distant from it . it was manned by five islanders , dressed in shirt tunics of calico . my first impression was that they were in the very act of pulling out from the bay ; and that , after all my exertions , i had come too late . my soul sunk within me : but a second glance convinced me that the boat was only hanging off to keep out of the surf ; and the next moment i heard my own name shouted out by a voice from the midst of the crowd .
melville	typee	looking in the direction of the sound , i perceived , to my indescribable joy , the tall figure of karakoee , an oahu kanaka , who had often been aboard the ‘ dolly ’ , while she lay in nukuheva . he wore the green shooting-jacket with gilt buttons , which had been given to him by an officer of the reine blanche -- the french flag-ship -- and in which i had always seen him dressed . i now remembered the kanaka had frequently told me that his person was tabooed in all the valleys of the island , and the sight of him at such a moment as this filled my heart with a tumult of delight .
melville	typee	karakoee stood near the edge of the water with a large roll of cotton-cloth thrown over one arm , and holding two or three canvas bags of powder , while with the other hand he grasped a musket , which he appeared to be proffering to several of the chiefs around him . but they turned with disgust from his offers and seemed to be impatient at his presence , with vehement gestures waving him off to his boat , and commanding him to depart .
melville	typee	the kanaka , however , still maintained his ground , and i at once perceived that he was seeking to purchase my freedom . animated by the idea , i called upon him loudly to come to me ; but he replied , in broken english , that the islanders had threatened to pierce him with their spears , if he stirred a foot towards me . at this time i was still advancing , surrounded by a dense throng of the natives , several of whom had their hands upon me , and more than one javelin was threateningly pointed at me . still i perceived clearly that many of those least friendly towards me looked irresolute and anxious . i was still some thirty yards from karakoee when my farther progress was prevented by the natives , who compelled me to sit down upon the ground , while they still retained their hold upon my arms . the din and tumult now became tenfold , and i perceived that several of the priests were on the spot , all of whom were evidently urging mow-mow and the other chiefs to prevent my departure ; and the detestable word ‘ roo-ne ! roo-ne ! ’ which i had heard repeated a thousand times during the day , was now shouted out on every side of me . still i saw that the kanaka continued his exertions in my favour -- that he was boldly debating the matter with the savages , and was striving to entice them by displaying his cloth and powder , and snapping the lock of his musket . but all he said or did appeared only to augment the clamours of those around him , who seemed bent upon driving him into the sea .
melville	typee	when i remembered the extravagant value placed by these people upon the articles which were offered to them in exchange for me , and which were so indignantly rejected , i saw a new proof of the same fixed determination of purpose they had all along manifested with regard to me , and in despair , and reckless of consequences , i exerted all my strength , and shaking myself free from the grasp of those who held me , i sprang upon my feet and rushed towards karakoee .
melville	typee	the rash attempt nearly decided my fate ; for , fearful that i might slip from them , several of the islanders now raised a simultaneous shout , and pressing upon karakoee , they menaced him with furious gestures , and actually forced him into the sea . appalled at their violence , the poor fellow , standing nearly to the waist in the surf , endeavoured to pacify them ; but at length fearful that they would do him some fatal violence , he beckoned to his comrades to pull in at once , and take him into the boat .
melville	typee	it was at this agonizing moment , when i thought all hope was ended , that a new contest arose between the two parties who had accompanied me to the shore ; blows were struck , wounds were given , and blood flowed . in the interest excited by the fray , every one had left me except marheyo , kory-kory and poor dear fayaway , who clung to me , sobbing indignantly . i saw that now or never was the moment . clasping my hands together , i looked imploringly at marheyo , and move towards the now almost deserted beach . the tears were in the old man ’ s eyes , but neither he nor kory-kory attempted to hold me , and i soon reached the kanaka , who had anxiously watched my movements ; the rowers pulled in as near as they dared to the edge of the surf ; i gave one parting embrace to fayaway , who seemed speechless with sorrow , and the next instant i found myself safe in the boat , and karakoee by my side , who told the rowers at once to give way . marheyo and kory-kory , and a great many of the women , followed me into the water , and i was determined , as the only mark of gratitude i could show , to give them the articles which had been brought as my ransom . i handed the musket to kory-kory , with a rapid gesture which was equivalent to a ‘ deed of gift ’ ; threw the roll of cotton to old marheyo , pointing as i did so to poor fayaway , who had retired from the edge of the water and was sitting down disconsolate on the shingles ; and tumbled the powder-bags out to the nearest young ladies , all of whom were vastly willing to take them . this distribution did not occupy ten seconds , and before it was over the boat was under full way ; the kanaka all the while exclaiming loudly against what he considered a useless throwing away of valuable property .
melville	typee	although it was clear that my movements had been noticed by several of the natives , still they had not suspended the conflict in which they were engaged , and it was not until the boat was above fifty yards from the shore that mow-mow and some six or seven other warriors rushed into the sea and hurled their javelins at us . some of the weapons passed quite as close to us as was desirable , but no one was wounded , and the men pulled away gallantly . but although soon out of the reach of the spears , our progress was extremely slow ; it blew strong upon the shore , and the tide was against us ; and i saw karakoee , who was steering the boat , give many a look towards a jutting point of the bay round which we had to pass .
melville	typee	for a minute or two after our departure , the savages , who had formed into different groups , remained perfectly motionless and silent . all at-once the enraged chief showed by his gestures that he had resolved what course he would take . shouting loudly to his companions , and pointing with his tomahawk towards the headland , he set off at full speed in that direction , and was followed by about thirty of the natives , among whom were several of the priests , all yelling out ‘ roo-ne ! roo-ne ! ’ at the very top of their voices . their intention was evidently to swim off from the headland and intercept us in our course . the wind was freshening every minute , and was right in our teeth , and it was one of those chopping angry seas in which it is so difficult to row . still the chances seemed in our favour , but when we came within a hundred yards of the point , the active savages were already dashing into the water , and we all feared that within five minutes ’ time we should have a score of the infuriated wretches around us . if so our doom was sealed , for these savages , unlike the feeble swimmer of civilized countries , are , if anything , more formidable antagonists in the water than when on the land . it was all a trial of strength ; our natives pulled till their oars bent again , and the crowd of swimmers shot through the water despite its roughness , with fearful rapidity .
melville	typee	by the time we had reached the headland , the savages were spread right across our course . our rowers got out their knives and held them ready between their teeth , and i seized the boat-hook . we were all aware that if they succeeded in intercepting us they would practise upon us the manoeuvre which has proved so fatal to many a boat ’ s crew in these seas . they would grapple the oars , and seizing hold of the gunwhale , capsize the boat , and then we should be entirely at their mercy .
melville	typee	after a few breathless moments discerned mow-mow . the athletic islander , with his tomahawk between his teeth , was dashing the water before him till it foamed again . he was the nearest to us , and in another instant he would have seized one of the oars . even at the moment i felt horror at the act i was about to commit ; but it was no time for pity or compunction , and with a true aim , and exerting all my strength , i dashed the boat-hook at him . it struck him just below the throat , and forced him downwards . i had no time to repeat the blow , but i saw him rise to the surface in the wake of the boat , and never shall i forget the ferocious expression of his countenance .
melville	typee	only one other of the savages reached the boat . he seized the gunwhale , but the knives of our rowers so mauled his wrists , that he was forced to quit his hold , and the next minute we were past them all , and in safety . the strong excitement which had thus far kept me up , now left me , and i fell back fainting into the arms of karakoee .
melville	typee	. . . . . . . . the circumstances connected with my most unexpected escape may be very briefly stated . the captain of an australian vessel , being in distress for men in these remote seas , had put into nukuheva in order to recruit his ship ’ s company ; but not a single man was to be obtained ; and the barque was about to get under weigh , when she was boarded by karakoee , who informed the disappointed englishman that an american sailor was detained by the savages in the neighbouring bay of typee ; and he offered , if supplied with suitable articles of traffic , to undertake his release . the kanaka had gained his intelligence from marnoo , to whom , after all , i was indebted for my escape . the proposition was acceded to ; and karakoee , taking with him five tabooed natives of nukuheva , again repaired aboard the barque , which in a few hours sailed to that part of the island , and threw her main-top-sail aback right off the entrance to the typee bay . the whale-boat , manned by the tabooed crew , pulled towards the head of the inlet , while the ship lay ‘ off and on ’ awaiting its return .
melville	typee	the events which ensued have already been detailed , and little more remains to be related . on reaching the ‘ julia ’ i was lifted over the side , and my strange appearance and remarkable adventure occasioned the liveliest interest . every attention was bestowed upon me that humanity could suggest . but to such a state was i reduced , that three months elapsed before i recovered my health .
melville	typee	the mystery which hung over the fate of my friend and companion toby has never been cleared up . i still remain ignorant whether he succeeded in leaving the valley , or perished at the hands of the islanders .
melville	typee	the story of toby the morning my comrade left me , as related in the narrative , he was accompanied by a large party of the natives , some of them carrying fruit and hogs for the purposes of traffic , as the report had spread that boats had touched at the bay .
melville	typee	as they proceeded through the settled parts of the valley , numbers joined them from every side , running with animated cries from every pathway . so excited were the whole party , that eager as toby was to gain the beach , it was almost as much as he could do to keep up with them . making the valley ring with their shouts , they hurried along on a swift trot , those in advance pausing now and then , and flourishing their weapons to urge the rest forward .
melville	typee	presently they came to a place where the paths crossed a bend of the main stream of the valley . here a strange sound came through the grove beyond , and the islanders halted . it was mow-mow , the one-eyed chief , who had gone on before ; he was striking his heavy lance against the hollow bough of a tree .
melville	typee	this was a signal of alarm ; -- for nothing was now heard but shouts of ‘ happar ! happar ! ’ -- the warriors tilting with their spears and brandishing them in the air , and the women and boys shouting to each other , and picking up the stones in the bed of the stream . in a moment or two mow-mow and two or three other chiefs ran out from the grove , and the din increased ten fold .
melville	typee	now , thought toby , for a fray ; and being unarmed , he besought one of the young men domiciled with marheyo for the loan of his spear . but he was refused ; the youth roguishly telling him that the weapon was very good for him ( the typee ) , but that a white man could fight much better with his fists .
melville	typee	the merry humour of this young wag seemed to be shared by the rest , for in spite of their warlike cries and gestures , everybody was capering and laughing , as if it was one of the funniest things in the world to be awaiting the flight of a score or two of happar javelins from an ambush in the thickets .
melville	typee	while my comrade was in vain trying to make out the meaning of all this , a good number of the natives separated themselves from the rest and ran off into the grove on one side , the others now keeping perfectly still , as if awaiting the result . after a little while , however , mow-mow , who stood in advance , motioned them to come on stealthily , which they did , scarcely rustling a leaf . thus they crept along for ten or fifteen minutes , every now and then pausing to listen .
melville	typee	toby by no means relished this sort of skulking ; if there was going to be a fight , he wanted it to begin at once . but all in good time , -- for just then , as they went prowling into the thickest of the wood , terrific howls burst upon them on all sides , and volleys of darts and stones flew across the path . not an enemy was to be seen , and what was still more surprising , not a single man dropped , though the pebbles fell among the leaves like hail .
melville	typee	there was a moment ’ s pause , when the typees , with wild shrieks , flung themselves into the covert , spear in hand ; nor was toby behindhand . coming so near getting his skull broken by the stones , and animated by an old grudge he bore the happars , he was among the first to dash at them . as he broke his way through the underbush , trying , as he did so , to wrest a spear from a young chief , the shouts of battle all of a sudden ceased , and the wood was as still as death . the next moment , the party who had left them so mysteriously rushed out from behind every bush and tree , and united with the rest in long and merry peals of laughter .
melville	typee	it was all a sham , and toby , who was quite out of breath with excitement , was much incensed at being made a fool of . it afterwards turned out that the whole affair had been concerted for his particular benefit , though with what precise view it would be hard to tell . my comrade was the more enraged at this boys ’ play , since it had consumed so much time , every moment of which might be precious . perhaps , however , it was partly intended for this very purpose ; and he was led to think so , because when the natives started again , he observed that they did not seem to be in so great a hurry as before . at last , after they had gone some distance , toby , thinking all the while that they never would get to the sea , two men came running towards them , and a regular halt ensued , followed by a noisy discussion , during which toby ’ s name was often repeated . all this made him more and more anxious to learn what was going on at the beach ; but it was in vain that he now tried to push forward ; the natives held him back .
melville	typee	in a few moments the conference ended , and many of them ran down the path in the direction of the water , the rest surrounding toby , and entreating him to ‘ moee ’ , or sit down and rest himself . as an additional inducement , several calabashes of food , which had been brought along , were now placed on the ground , and opened , and pipes also were lighted . toby bridled his impatience a while , but at last sprang to his feet and dashed forward again . he was soon overtaken nevertheless , and again surrounded , but without further detention was then permitted to go down to the sea .
melville	typee	they came out upon a bright green space between the groves and the water , and close under the shadow of the happar mountain , where a path was seen winding out of sight through a gorge .
melville	typee	no sign of a boat , however , was beheld , nothing but a tumultuous crowd of men and women , and some one in their midst , earnestly talking to them . as my comrade advanced , this person came forward and proved to be no stranger . he was an old grizzled sailor , whom toby and myself had frequently seen in nukuheva , where he lived an easy devil-may-care life in the household of mowanna the king , going by the name of ‘ jimmy ’ . in fact he was the royal favourite , and had a good deal to say in his master ’ s councils . he wore a manilla hat and a sort of tappa morning gown , sufficiently loose and negligent to show the verse of a song tattooed upon his chest , and a variety of spirited cuts by native artists in other parts of his body . he sported a fishing rod in his hand , and carried a sooty old pipe slung about his neck .
melville	typee	this old rover having retired from active life , had resided in nukuheva some time -- could speak the language , and for that reason was frequently employed by the french as an interpreter . he was an arrant old gossip too ; for ever coming off in his canoe to the ships in the bay , and regaling their crews with choice little morsels of court scandal -- such , for instance , as a shameful intrigue of his majesty with a happar damsel , a public dancer at the feasts -- and otherwise relating some incredible tales about the marquesas generally . i remember in particular his telling the dolly ’ s crew what proved to be literally a cock-and-bull story , about two natural prodigies which he said were then on the island . one was an old monster of a hermit , having a marvellous reputation for sanctity , and reputed a famous sorcerer , who lived away off in a den among the mountains , where he hid from the world a great pair of horns that grew out of his temples . notwithstanding his reputation for piety , this horrid old fellow was the terror of all the island round , being reported to come out from his retreat , and go a man-hunting every dark night . some anonymous paul pry , too , coming down the mountain , once got a peep at his den , and found it full of bones . in short , he was a most unheard-of monster .
melville	typee	the other prodigy jimmy told us about was the younger son of a chief , who , although but just turned of ten , had entered upon holy orders , because his superstitious countrymen thought him especially intended for the priesthood from the fact of his having a comb on his head like a rooster . but this was not all ; for still more wonderful to relate , the boy prided himself upon his strange crest , being actually endowed with a cock ’ s voice , and frequently crowing over his peculiarity .
melville	typee	but to return to toby . the moment he saw the old rover on the beach , he ran up to him , the natives following after , and forming a circle round them .
melville	typee	after welcoming him to the shore , jimmy went on to tell him how that he knew all about our having run away from the ship , and being among the typees . indeed , he had been urged by mowanna to come over to the valley , and after visiting his friends there , to bring us back with him , his royal master being exceedingly anxious to share with him the reward which had been held out for our capture . he , however , assured toby that he had indignantly spurned the offer .
melville	typee	all this astonished my comrade not a little , as neither of us had entertained the least idea that any white man ever visited the typees sociably . but jimmy told him that such was the case nevertheless , although he seldom came into the bay , and scarcely ever went back from the beach . one of the priests of the valley , in some way or other connected with an old tattooed divine in nukuheva , was a friend of his , and through him he was ‘ taboo ’ .
melville	typee	he said , moreover , that he was sometimes employed to come round to the bay , and engage fruit for ships lying in nukuheva . in fact , he was now on that very errand , according to his own account , having just come across the mountains by the way of happar . by noon of the next day the fruit would be heaped up in stacks on the beach , in readiness for the boats which he then intended to bring into the bay .
melville	typee	jimmy now asked toby whether he wished to leave the island -- if he did , there was a ship in want of men lying in the other harbour , and he would be glad to take him over , and see him on board that very day .
melville	typee	‘ no , ’ said toby , ‘ i can not leave the island unless my comrade goes with me . i left him up the valley because they would not let him come down . let us go now and fetch him . ’
melville	typee	‘ but how is he to cross the mountain with us , ’ replied jimmy , ‘ even if we get him down to the beach ? better let him stay till tomorrow , and i will bring him round to nukuheva in the boats . ’
melville	typee	‘ that will never do , ’ said toby , ‘ but come along with me now , and let us get him down here at any rate , ’ and yielding to the impulse of the moment , he started to hurry back into the valley . but hardly was his back turned , when a dozen hands were laid on him , and he learned that he could not go a step further .
melville	typee	it was in vain that he fought with them ; they would not hear of his stirring from the beach . cut to the heart at this unexpected repulse , toby now conjured the sailor to go after me alone . but jimmy replied , that in the mood the typees then were they would not permit him so to do , though at the same time he was not afraid of their offering him any harm .
melville	typee	little did toby then think , as he afterwards had good reason to suspect , that this very jimmy was a heartless villain , who , by his arts , had just incited the natives to restrain him as he was in the act of going after me . well must the old sailor have known , too , that the natives would never consent to our leaving together , and he therefore wanted to get toby off alone , for a purpose which he afterwards made plain . of all this , however , my comrade now knew nothing .
melville	typee	he was still struggling with the islanders when jimmy again came up to him , and warned him against irritating them , saying that he was only making matters worse for both of us , and if they became enraged , there was no telling what might happen . at last he made toby sit down on a broken canoe by a pile of stones , upon which was a ruinous little shrine supported by four upright poles , and in front partly screened by a net . the fishing parties met there , when they came in from the sea , for their offerings were laid before an image , upon a smooth black stone within . this spot jimmy said was strictly ‘ taboo ’ , and no one would molest or come near him while he stayed by its shadow . the old sailor then went off , and began speaking very earnestly to mow-mow and some other chiefs , while all the rest formed a circle round the taboo place , looking intently at toby , and talking to each other without ceasing .
melville	typee	now , notwithstanding what jimmy had just told him , there presently came up to my comrade an old woman , who seated herself beside him on the canoe . ‘ typee motarkee ? ’ said she . ‘ motarkee nuee , ’ said toby .
melville	typee	she then asked him whether he was going to nukuheva ; he nodded yes ; and with a plaintive wail and her eyes filling with tears she rose and left him . this old woman , the sailor afterwards said , was the wife of an aged king of a small island valley , communicating by a deep pass with the country of the typees . the inmates of the two valleys were related to each other by blood , and were known by the same name . the old woman had gone down into the typee valley the day before , and was now with three chiefs , her sons , on a visit to her kinsmen .
melville	typee	as the old king ’ s wife left him , jimmy again came up to toby , and told him that he had just talked the whole matter over with the natives , and there was only one course for him to follow . they would not allow him to go back into the valley , and harm would certainly come to both him and me , if he remained much longer on the beach . ‘ so , ’ said he , ‘ you and i had better go to nukuheva now overland , and tomorrow i will bring tommo , as they call him , by water ; they have promised to carry him down to the sea for me early in the morning , so that there will be no delay . ’
melville	typee	‘ no , no , ’ said toby desperately , ‘ i will not leave him that way ; we must escape together. ’ ‘ then there is no hope for you , ’ exclaimed the sailor , ‘ for if i leave you here on the beach , as soon as i am gone you will be carried back into the valley , and then neither of you will ever look upon the sea again. ’ and with many oaths he swore that if he would only go to nukuheva with him that day , he would be sure to have me there the very next morning .
melville	typee	‘ but how do you know they will bring him down to the beach tomorrow , when they will not do so today ? ’ said toby . but the sailor had many reasons , all of which were so mixed up with the mysterious customs of the islanders , that he was none the wiser . indeed , their conduct , especially in preventing him from returning into the valley , was absolutely unaccountable to him ; and added to everything else , was the bitter reflection , that the old sailor , after all , might possibly be deceiving him . and then again he had to think of me , left alone with the natives , and by no means well . if he went with jimmy , he might at least hope to procure some relief for me . but might not the savages who had acted so strangely , hurry me off somewhere before his return ? then , even if he remained , perhaps they would not let him go back into the valley where i was .
melville	typee	thus perplexed was my poor comrade ; he knew not what to do , and his courageous spirit was of no use to him now . there he was , all by himself , seated upon the broken canoe -- the natives grouped around him at a distance , and eyeing him more and more fixedly . ‘ it is getting late : said jimmy , who was standing behind the rest . ‘ nukuheva is far off , and i can not cross the happar country by night . you see how it is ; -- if you come along with me , all will be well ; if you do not , depend upon it , neither of you will ever escape . ’
melville	typee	‘ there is no help for it , ’ said toby , at last , with a heavy heart , ‘ i will have to trust you , ’ and he came out from the shadow of the little shrine , and cast a long look up the valley .
melville	typee	‘ now keep close to my side , ’ said the sailor , ‘ and let us be moving quickly. ’ tinor and fayaway here appeared ; the kindhearted old woman embracing toby ’ s knees , and giving way to a flood of tears ; while fayaway , hardly less moved , spoke some few words of english she had learned , and held up three fingers before him -- in so many days he would return .
melville	typee	at last jimmy pulled toby out of the crowd , and after calling to a young typee who was standing by with a young pig in his arms , all three started for the mountains .
melville	typee	‘ i have told them that you are coming back again , ’ said the old fellow , laughing , as they began the ascent , ‘ but they ’ ll have to wait a long time. ’ toby turned , and saw the natives all in motion -- the girls waving their tappas in adieu , and the men their spears . as the last figure entered the grove with one arm raised , and the three fingers spread , his heart smote him .
melville	typee	as the natives had at last consented to his going , it might have been , that some of them , at least , really counted upon his speedy return ; probably supposing , as indeed he had told them when they were coming down the valley , that his only object in leaving them was to procure the medicines i needed . this , jimmy also must have told them . and as they had done before , when my comrade , to oblige me , started on his perilous journey to nukuheva , they looked upon me , in his absence , as one of two inseparable friends who was a sure guaranty for the other ’ s return . this is only my own supposition , however , for as to all their strange conduct , it is still a mystery .
melville	typee	‘ you see what sort of a taboo man i am , ’ said the sailor , after for some time silently following the path which led up the mountain . ‘ mow-mow made me a present of this pig here , and the man who carries it will go right through happar , and down into nukuheva with us . so long as he stays by me he is safe , and just so it will be with you , and tomorrow with tommo . cheer up , then , and rely upon me , you will see him in the morning . ’
melville	typee	the ascent of the mountain was not very difficult , owing to its being near to the sea , where the island ridges are comparatively low ; the path , too , was a fine one , so that in a short time all three were standing on the summit with the two valleys at their feet . the white cascade marking the green head of the typee valley first caught toby ’ s eye ; marheyo ’ s house could easily be traced by them .
melville	typee	as jimmy led the way along the ridge , toby observed that the valley of the happars did not extend near so far inland as that of the typees . this accounted for our mistake in entering the latter valley as we had .
melville	typee	a path leading down from the mountain was soon seen , and , following it , the party were in a short time fairly in the happar valley . ‘ now , ’ said jimmy , as they hurried on , ‘ we taboo men have wives in all the bays , and i am going to show you the two i have here . ’
melville	typee	so , when they came to the house where he said they lived , -- which was close by the base of the mountain in a shady nook among the groves -- he went in , and was quite furious at finding it empty -- the ladies , had gone out . however , they soon made their appearance , and to tell the truth , welcomed jimmy quite cordially , as well as toby , about whom they were very inquisitive . nevertheless , as the report of their arrival spread , and the happars began to assemble , it became evident that the appearance of a white stranger among them was not by any means deemed so wonderful an event as in the neighbouring valley .
melville	typee	the old sailor now bade his wives prepare something to eat , as he must be in nukuheva before dark . a meal of fish , bread-fruit , and bananas , was accordingly served up , the party regaling themselves on the mats , in the midst of a numerous company .
melville	typee	the happars put many questions to jimmy about toby ; and toby himself looked sharply at them , anxious to recognize the fellow who gave him the wound from which he was still suffering . but this fiery gentleman , so handy with his spear , had the delicacy , it seemed , to keep out of view . certainly the sight of him would not have been any added inducement to making a stay in the valley , -- some of the afternoon loungers in happar having politely urged toby to spend a few days with them , -- there was a feast coming on . he , however , declined .
melville	typee	all this while the young typee stuck to jimmy like his shadow , and though as lively a dog as any of his tribe , he was now as meek as a lamb , never opening his mouth except to eat . although some of the happars looked queerly at him , others were more civil , and seemed desirous of taking him abroad and showing him the valley . but the typee was not to be cajoled in that way . how many yards he would have to remove from jimmy before the taboo would be powerless , it would be hard to tell , but probably he himself knew to a fraction .
melville	typee	on the promise of a red cotton handkerchief , and something else which he kept secret , this poor fellow had undertaken a rather ticklish journey , though , as far as toby could ascertain , it was something that had never happened before .
melville	typee	the island-punch -- arva -- was brought in at the conclusion of the repast , and passed round in a shallow calabash . now my comrade , while seated in the happar house , began to feel more troubled than ever at leaving me ; indeed , so sad did he feel that he talked about going back to the valley , and wanted jimmy to escort him as far as the mountains . but the sailor would not listen to him , and , by way of diverting his thoughts , pressed him to drink of the arva . knowing its narcotic nature , he refused ; but jimmy said he would have something mixed with it , which would convert it into an innocent beverage that would inspirit them for the rest of their journey . so at last he was induced to drink of it , and its effects were just as the sailor had predicted ; his spirits rose at once , and all his gloomy thoughts left him .
melville	typee	the old rover now began to reveal his true character , though he was hardly suspected at the time . ‘ if i get you off to a ship , ’ said he , ‘ you will surely give a poor fellow something for saving you. ’ in short , before they left the house , he made toby promise that he would give him five spanish dollars if he succeeded in getting any part of his wages advanced from the vessel , aboard of which they were going ; toby , moreover , engaging to reward him still further , as soon as my deliverance was accomplished .
melville	typee	a little while after this they started again , accompanied by many of the natives , and going up the valley , took a steep path near its head , which led to nukuheva . here the happars paused and watched them as they ascended the mountain , one group of bandit-looking fellows , shaking their spears and casting threatening glances at the poor typee , whose heart as well as heels seemed much the lighter when he came to look down upon them .
melville	typee	on gaining the heights once more , their way led for a time along several ridges covered with enormous ferns . at last they entered upon a wooded tract , and here they overtook a party of nukuheva natives , well armed , and carrying bundles of long poles . jimmy seemed to know them all very well , and stopped for a while , and had a talk about the ‘ wee-wees ’ , as the people of nukuheva call the monsieurs .
melville	typee	the party with the poles were king mowanna ’ s men , and by his orders they had been gathering them in the ravines for his allies the french . leaving these fellows to trudge on with their loads , toby and his companions now pushed forward again , as the sun was already low in the west . they came upon the valleys of nukuheva on one side of the bay , where the highlands slope off into the sea . the men-of-war were still lying in the harbour , and as toby looked down upon them , the strange events which had happened so recently , seemed all a dream .
melville	typee	they soon descended towards the beach , and found themselves in jimmy ’ s house before it was well dark . here he received another welcome from his nukuheva wives , and after some refreshments in the shape of cocoanut milk and poee-poee , they entered a canoe ( the typee of course going along ) and paddled off to a whaleship which was anchored near the shore . this was the vessel in want of men . our own had sailed some time before . the captain professed great pleasure at seeing toby , but thought from his exhausted appearance that he must be unfit for duty . however , he agreed to ship him , as well as his comrade , as soon as he should arrive . toby begged hard for an armed boat , in which to go round to typee and rescue me , notwithstanding the promises of jimmy . but this the captain would not hear of , and told him to have patience , for the sailor would be faithful to his word . when , too , he demanded the five silver dollars for jimmy , the captain was unwilling to give them . but toby insisted upon it , as he now began to think that jimmy might be a mere mercenary , who would be sure to prove faithless if not well paid . accordingly he not only gave him the money , but took care to assure him , over and over again , that as soon as he brought me aboard he would receive a still larger sum .
melville	typee	before sun-rise the next day , jimmy and the typee started in two of the ship ’ s boats , which were manned by tabooed natives . toby , of course , was all eagerness to go along , but the sailor told him that if he did , it would spoil all ; so , hard as it was , he was obliged to remain .
melville	typee	towards evening he was on the watch , and descried the boats turning the headland and entering the bay . he strained his eyes , and thought he saw me ; but i was not there . descending from the mast almost distracted , he grappled jimmy as he struck the deck , shouting in a voice that startled him , ‘ where is tommo ? ’ the old fellow faltered , but soon recovering , did all he could to soothe him , assuring him that it had proved to be impossible to get me down to the shore that morning ; assigning many plausible reasons , and adding that early on the morrow he was going to visit the bay again in a french boat , when , if he did not find me on the beach -- as this time he certainly expected to -- he would march right back into the valley , and carry me away at all hazards . he , however , again refused to allow toby to accompany him . now , situated as toby was , his sole dependence for the present was upon this jimmy , and therefore he was fain to comfort himself as well as he could with what the old sailor told him . the next morning , however , he had the satisfaction of seeing the french boat start with jimmy in it . tonight , then , i will see him , thought toby ; but many a long day passed before he ever saw tommo again . hardly was the boat out of sight , when the captain came forward and ordered the anchor weighed ; he was going to sea .
melville	typee	vain were all toby ’ s ravings -- they were disregarded ; and when he came to himself , the sails were set , and the ship fast leaving the land . ... ‘ oh ! ’ said he to me at our meeting , ‘ what sleepless nights were mine . often i started from my hammock , dreaming you were before me , and upbraiding me for leaving you on the island . ’
melville	typee	. . . . . . . there is little more to be related . toby left this vessel at new zealand , and after some further adventures , arrived home in less than two years after leaving the marquesas . he always thought of me as dead -- and i had every reason to suppose that he too was no more ; but a strange meeting was in store for us , one which made toby ’ s heart all the lighter .
melville	typee	note . the author was more than two years in the south seas , after escaping from the valley , as recounted in the last chapter . some time after returning home the foregoing narrative was published , though it was little thought at the time that this would be the means of revealing the existence of toby , who had long been given up for lost . but so it proved .
melville	typee	the story of his escape supplies a natural sequel to the adventure , and as such it is now added to the volume . it was related to the author by toby himself , not ten days since .
melville	omoo	the cockney darted among some bushes ; and , a few moments after , we heard the report of his musket , followed by a quick cry . on running up , we saw our comrade doing battle with a young devil of a boar , as black as night , whose snout had been partly torn away . firing when the game was in full career , and coming directly toward him , shorty had been assailed by the enraged brute ; it was now crunching the breech of the musket , with which he had tried to club it ; shorty holding fast to the barrel , and fingering his waist for a knife . being in advance of the others , i clapped my gun to the boar ’ s head , and so put an end to the contest .
melville	omoo	evening now coming on , we set to work loading our carriers . the cattle were so small that a stout native could walk off with an entire quarter ; brushing through thickets , and descending rocks without an apparent effort ; though , to tell the truth , no white man present could have done the thing with any ease . as for the wild hogs , none of the islanders could be induced to carry shorty ’ s ; some invincible superstition being connected with its black colour . we were , therefore , obliged to leave it . the other , a spotted one , being slung by green thongs to a pole , was marched off with by two young natives .
melville	omoo	with our bearers of burdens ahead , we then commenced our return down the valley . half-way home , darkness overtook us in the woods ; and torches became necessary . we stopped , and made them of dry palm branches ; and then , sending two lads on in advance for the purpose of gathering fuel to feed the flambeaux , we continued our journey .
melville	omoo	it was a wild sight . the torches , waved aloft , flashed through the forest ; and , where the ground admitted , the islanders went along on a brisk trot , notwithstanding they bent forward under their loads . their naked backs were stained with blood ; and occasionally , running by each other , they raised wild cries which startled the hillsides .
melville	omoo	chapter lviii . the hunting-feast ; and a visit to afrehitoo two bullocks and a boar ! no bad trophies of our day ’ s sport . so by torchlight we marched into the plantation , the wild hog rocking from its pole , and the doctor singing an old hunting-song—tally-ho ! the chorus of which swelled high above the yells of the natives .
melville	omoo	we resolved to make a night of it . kindling a great fire just outside the dwelling , and hanging one of the heifer ’ s quarters from a limb of the banian-tree , everyone was at liberty to cut and broil for himself . baskets of roasted bread-fruit , and plenty of taro pudding ; bunches of bananas , and young cocoa-nuts , had also been provided by the natives against our return .
melville	omoo	the fire burned bravely , keeping off the mosquitoes , and making every man ’ s face glow like a beaker of port . the meat had the true wild-game flavour , not at all impaired by our famous appetites , and a couple of flasks of white brandy , which zeke , producing from his secret store , circulated freely .
melville	omoo	there was no end to my long comrade ’ s spirits . after telling his stories , and singing his songs , he sprang to his feet , clasped a young damsel of the grove round the waist , and waltzed over the grass with her . but there ’ s no telling all the pranks he played that night . the natives , who delight in a wag , emphatically pronounced him “ maitai . ”
melville	omoo	it was long after midnight ere we broke up ; but when the rest had retired , zeke , with the true thrift of a yankee , salted down what was left of the meat .
melville	omoo	the next day was sunday ; and at my request , shorty accompanied me to afrehitoo—a neighbouring bay , and the seat of a mission , almost directly opposite papeetee . in afrehitoo is a large church and school-house , both quite dilapidated ; and planted amid shrubbery on a fine knoll , stands a very tasteful cottage , commanding a view across the channel . in passing , i caught sight of a graceful calico skirt disappearing from the piazza through a doorway . the place was the residence of the missionary .
melville	omoo	a trim little sail-boat was dancing out at her moorings , a few yards from the beach . straggling over the low lands in the vicinity were several native huts—untidy enough—but much better every way than most of those in tahiti .
melville	omoo	we attended service at the church , where we found but a small congregation ; and after what i had seen in papeetee , nothing very interesting took place . but the audience had a curious , fidgety look , which i knew not how to account for until we ascertained that a sermon with the eighth commandment for a text was being preached .
melville	omoo	it seemed that there lived an englishman in the district , who , like our friends , the planters , was cultivating tombez potatoes for the papeetee market . in spite of all his precautions , the natives were in the habit of making nocturnal forays into his inclosure , and carrying off the potatoes . one night he fired a fowling-piece , charged with pepper and salt , at several shadows which he discovered stealing across his premises . they fled . but it was like seasoning anything else ; the knaves stole again with a greater relish than ever ; and the very next night , he caught a party in the act of roasting a basketful of potatoes under his own cooking-shed . at last , he stated his grievances to the missionary ; who , for the benefit of his congregation , preached the sermon we heard .
melville	omoo	now , there were no thieves in martair ; but then , the people of the valley were bribed to be honest . it was a regular business transaction between them and the planters . in consideration of so many potatoes “ to them in hand , duly paid , ” they were to abstain from all depredations upon the plantation . another security against roguery was the permanent residence upon the premises of their chief , tonoi .
melville	omoo	on our return to martair in the afternoon , we found the doctor and zeke making themselves comfortable . the latter was reclining on the ground , pipe in mouth , watching the doctor , who , sitting like a turk , before a large iron kettle , was slicing potatoes and indian turnip , and now and then shattering splinters from a bone ; all of which , by turns , were thrown into the pot . he was making what he called “ bullock broth . ”
melville	omoo	in gastronomic affairs , my friend was something of an artist ; and by way of improving his knowledge , did nothing the rest of the day but practise in what might be called experimental cookery : broiling and grilling , and deviling slices of meat , and subjecting them to all sorts of igneous operations . it was the first fresh beef that either of us had tasted in more than a year .
melville	omoo	“ oh , ye ’ ll pick up arter a while , peter , ” observed zeke toward night , as long ghost was turning a great rib over the coals— “ what d ’ ye think , paul ? ” “ he ’ ll get along , i dare say , ” replied i ; “ he only wants to get those cheeks of his tanned. ” to tell the truth , i was not a little pleased to see the doctor ’ s reputation as an invalid fading away so fast ; especially as , on the strength of his being one , he had promised to have such easy times of it , and very likely , too , at my expense .
melville	omoo	chapter lix . the murphies dozing in our canoe the next morning about daybreak , we were awakened by zeke ’ s hailing us loudly from the beach . upon paddling up , he told us that a canoe had arrived overnight , from papeetee , with an order from a ship lying there for a supply of his potatoes ; and as they must be on board the vessel by noon , he wanted us to assist in bringing them down to his sail-boat .
melville	omoo	my long comrade was one of those who , from always thrusting forth the wrong foot foremost when they rise , or committing some other indiscretion of the limbs , are more or less crabbed or sullen before breakfast . it was in vain , therefore , that the yankee deplored the urgency of the case which obliged him to call us up thus early : —the doctor only looked the more glum , and said nothing in reply .
melville	omoo	at last , by way of getting up a little enthusiasm for the occasion , the yankee exclaimed quite spiritedly , “ what d ’ ye say , then , b ’ ys , shall we get at it ? ” “ yes , in the devil ’ s name ! ” replied the doctor , like a snapping turtle ; and we moved on to the house . notwithstanding his ungracious answer , he probably thought that , after the gastronomic performance of the day previous , it would hardly do to hang back . at the house , we found shorty ready with the hoes ; and we at once repaired to the farther side of the inclosure , where the potatoes had yet to be taken out of the ground .
melville	omoo	the rich , tawny soil seemed specially adapted to the crop ; the great yellow murphies rolling out of the hills like eggs from a nest . my comrade really surprised me by the zeal with which he applied himself to his hoe . for my own part , exhilarated by the cool breath of the morning , i worked away like a good fellow . as for zeke and the cockney , they seemed mightily pleased at this evidence of our willingness to exert ourselves .
melville	omoo	it was not long ere all the potatoes were turned out ; and then came the worst of it : they were to be lugged down to the beach , a distance of at least a quarter of a mile . and there being no such thing as a barrow , or cart , on the island , there was nothing for it but spinal-marrows and broad shoulders . well knowing that this part of the business would be anything but agreeable , zeke did his best to put as encouraging a face upon it as possible ; and giving us no time to indulge in desponding thoughts , gleefully directed our attention to a pile of rude baskets—made of stout stalks—which had been provided for the occasion . so , without more ado , we helped ourselves from the heap : and soon we were all four staggering along under our loads .
melville	omoo	the first trip down , we arrived at the beach together : zeke ’ s enthusiastic cries proving irresistible . a trip or two more , however , and my shoulders began to grate in their sockets ; while the doctor ’ s tall figure acquired an obvious stoop . presently , we both threw down our baskets , protesting we could stand it no longer . but our employers , bent , as it were , upon getting the work out of us by a silent appeal to our moral sense , toiled away without pretending to notice us . it was as much as to say , “ there , men , we ’ ve been boarding and lodging ye for the last three days ; and yesterday ye did nothing earthly but eat ; so stand by now , and look at us working , if ye dare. ” thus driven to it , then , we resumed our employment . yet , in spite of all we could do , we lagged behind zeke and shorty , who , breathing hard , and perspiring at every pore , toiled away without pause or cessation . i almost wickedly wished that they would load themselves down with one potato too many .
melville	omoo	gasping as i was with my own hamper , i could not , for the life of me , help laughing at long ghost . there he went : —his long neck thrust forward , his arms twisted behind him to form a shelf for his basket to rest on ; and his stilts of legs every once in a while giving way under him , as if his knee-joints slipped either way .
melville	omoo	“ there ! i carry no more ! ” he exclaimed all at once , flinging his potatoes into the boat , where the yankee was just then stowing them away . “ oh , then , ” said zeke , quite briskly , “ i guess you and paul had better try the ‘ barrel-machine ’ —come along , i ’ ll fix ye out in no time ” ; and , so saying , he waded ashore , and hurried back to the house , bidding us follow .
melville	omoo	wondering what upon earth the “ barrel-machine ” could be , and rather suspicious of it , we limped after . on arriving at the house , we found him getting ready a sort of sedan-chair . it was nothing more than an old barrel suspended by a rope from the middle of a stout oar . quite an ingenious contrivance of the yankee ’ s ; and his proposed arrangement with regard to mine and the doctor ’ s shoulders was equally so .
melville	omoo	“ there now ! ” said he , when everything was ready , “ there ’ s no back-breaking about this ; you can stand right up under it , you see : jist try it once ” ; and he politely rested the blade of the oar on my comrade ’ s right shoulder , and the other end on mine , leaving the barrel between us .
melville	omoo	“ jist the thing ! ” he added , standing off admiringly , while we remained in this interesting attitude . there was no help for us ; with broken hearts and backs we trudged back to the field ; the doctor all the while saying masses .
melville	omoo	upon starting with the loaded barrel , for a few paces we got along pretty well , and were constrained to think the idea not a bad one . but we did not long think so . in less than five minutes we came to a dead halt , the springing and buckling of the clumsy oar being almost unendurable .
melville	omoo	“ let ’ s shift ends , ” cried the doctor , who did not relish the blade of the stick , which was cutting into the blade of his shoulder . at last , by stages short and frequent , we managed to shamble down the beach , where we again dumped our cargo , in something of a pet .
melville	omoo	“ why not make the natives help ? ” asked long ghost , rubbing his shoulder . “ natives be dumned ! ” said the yankee , “ twenty on ’ em ain ’ t worth one white man . they never was meant to work any , them chaps ; and they knows it , too , for dumned little work any on ’ em ever does . ”
melville	omoo	but , notwithstanding this abuse , zeke was at last obliged to press a few of the bipeds into service . “ aramai ! ” ( come here ) he shouted to several , who , reclining on a bank , had hitherto been critical observers of our proceedings ; and , among other things , had been particularly amused by the performance with the sedan-chair .
melville	omoo	after making these fellows load their baskets together , the yankee filled his own , and then drove them before him down to the beach . probably he had seen the herds of panniered mules driven in this way by mounted indians along the great callao to lima . the boat at last loaded , the yankee , taking with him a couple of natives , at once hoisted sail , and stood across the channel for papeetee .
melville	omoo	the next morning at breakfast , old tonoi ran in , and told us that the voyagers were returning . we hurried down to the beach , and saw the boat gliding toward us , with a dozing islander at the helm , and zeke standing up in the bows , jingling a small bag of silver , the proceeds of his cargo .
melville	omoo	chapter lx . what they thought of us in martair several quiet days now passed away , during which we just worked sufficiently to sharpen our appetites ; the planters leniently exempting us from any severe toil .
melville	omoo	their desire to retain us became more and more evident ; which was not to be wondered at ; for , beside esteeming us from the beginning a couple of civil , good-natured fellows , who would soon become quite at-home with them , they were not slow in perceiving that we were far different from the common run of rovers ; and that our society was both entertaining and instructive to a couple of solitary , illiterate men like themselves .
melville	omoo	in a literary point of view , indeed , they soon regarded us with emotions of envy and wonder ; and the doctor was considered nothing short of a prodigy . the cockney found out that he ( the doctor ) could read a book upside down , without even so much as spelling the big words beforehand ; and the yankee , in the twinkling of an eye , received from him the sum total of several arithmetical items , stated aloud , with the view of testing the extent of his mathematical lore .
melville	omoo	then , frequently , in discoursing upon men and things , my long comrade employed such imposing phrases that , upon one occasion , they actually remained uncovered while he talked . in short , their favourable opinion of long ghost in particular rose higher and higher every day ; and they began to indulge in all manner of dreams concerning the advantages to be derived from employing so learned a labourer . among other projects revealed was that of building a small craft of some forty tons for the purpose of trading among the neighbouring islands . with a native crew , we would then take turns cruising over the tranquil pacific ; touching here and there , as caprice suggested , and collecting romantic articles of commerce ; —beach-de-mer , the pearl-oyster , arrow-root , ambergris , sandal-wood , cocoa-nut oil , and edible birdnests .
melville	omoo	this south sea yachting was delightful to think of ; and straightway , the doctor announced his willingness to navigate the future schooner clear of all shoals and reefs whatsoever . his impudence was audacious . he enlarged upon the science of navigation ; treated us to a dissertation on mercator ’ s sailing and the azimuth compass ; and went into an inexplicable explanation of the lord only knows what plan of his for infallibly settling the longitude .
melville	omoo	whenever my comrade thus gave the reins to his fine fancy , it was a treat to listen , and therefore i never interfered ; but , with the planters , sat in mute admiration before him . this apparent self-abasement on my part must have been considered as truly indicative of our respective merits ; for , to my no small concern , i quickly perceived that , in the estimate formed of us , long ghost began to be rated far above myself . for aught i knew , indeed , he might have privately thrown out a hint concerning the difference in our respective stations aboard the julia ; or else the planters must have considered him some illustrious individual , for certain inscrutable reasons , going incog . with this idea of him , his undisguised disinclination for work became venial ; and entertaining such views of extending their business , they counted more upon his ultimate value to them as a man of science than as a mere ditcher .
melville	omoo	nor did the humorous doctor forbear to foster an opinion every way so advantageous to himself ; at times , for the sake of the joke , assuming airs of superiority over myself , which , though laughable enough , were sometimes annoying .
melville	omoo	to tell the plain truth , things at last came to such a pass that i told him , up and down , that i had no notion to put up with his pretensions ; if he were going to play the gentleman , i was going to follow suit ; and then there would quickly be an explosion .
melville	omoo	at this he laughed heartily ; and after some mirthful chat , we resolved upon leaving the valley as soon as we could do so with a proper regard to politeness . at supper , therefore , the same evening , the doctor hinted at our intention .
melville	omoo	though much surprised , and vexed , zeke moved not a muscle . “ peter , ” said he at last—very gravely—and after mature deliberation , “ would you like to do the cooking ? it ’ s easy work ; and you needn ’ t do anything else . paul ’ s heartier ; he can work in the field when it suits him ; and before long , we ’ ll have ye at something more agreeable : —won ’ t we , shorty ? ”
melville	omoo	shorty assented . doubtless , the proposed arrangement was a snug one ; especially the sinecure for the doctor ; but i by no means relished the functions allotted to myself—they were too indefinite . nothing final , however , was agreed upon ; —our intention to leave was revealed , and that was enough for the present . but , as we said nothing further about going , the yankee must have concluded that we might yet be induced to remain . he redoubled his endeavours to make us contented .
melville	omoo	it was during this state of affairs that , one morning , before breakfast , we were set to weeding in a potato-patch ; and the planters being engaged at the house , we were left to ourselves .
melville	omoo	now , though the pulling of weeds was considered by our employers an easy occupation ( for which reason they had assigned it to us ) , and although as a garden recreation it may be pleasant enough , for those who like it—still , long persisted in , the business becomes excessively irksome .
melville	omoo	nevertheless , we toiled away for some time , until the doctor , who , from his height , was obliged to stoop at a very acute angle , suddenly sprang upright ; and with one hand propping his spinal column , exclaimed , “ oh , that one ’ s joints were but provided with holes to drop a little oil through ! ”
melville	omoo	vain as the aspiration was for this proposed improvement upon our species , i cordially responded thereto ; for every vertebra in my spine was articulating in sympathy . presently , the sun rose over the mountains , inducing that deadly morning languor so fatal to early exertion in a warm climate . we could stand it no longer ; but , shouldering our hoes , moved on to the house , resolved to impose no more upon the good-nature of the planters by continuing one moment longer in an occupation so extremely uncongenial .
melville	omoo	we freely told them so . zeke was exceedingly hurt , and said everything he could think of to alter our determination ; but , finding all unavailing , he very hospitably urged us not to be in any hurry about leaving ; for we might stay with him as guests until we had time to decide upon our future movements .
melville	omoo	we thanked him sincerely ; but replied that , the following morning , we must turn our backs upon the hills of martair . chapter lxi . preparing for the journey during the remainder of the day we loitered about , talking over our plans .
melville	omoo	the doctor was all eagerness to visit tamai , a solitary inland village , standing upon the banks of a considerable lake of the same name , and embosomed among groves . from afrehitoo you went to this place by a lonely pathway leading through the wildest scenery in the world . much , too , we had heard concerning the lake itself , which abounded in such delicious fish that , in former times , angling parties occasionally came over to it from papeetee .
melville	omoo	upon its banks , moreover , grew the finest fruit of the islands , and in their greatest perfection . the “ ve , ” or brazilian plum , here attained the size of an orange ; and the gorgeous “ arheea , ” or red apple of tahiti , blushed with deeper dyes than in any of the seaward valleys .
melville	omoo	beside all this , in tamai dwelt the most beautiful and unsophisticated women in the entire society group . in short , the village was so remote from the coast , and had been so much less affected by recent changes than other places that , in most things , tahitian life was here seen as formerly existing in the days of young otoo , the boy-king , in cook ’ s time .
melville	omoo	after obtaining from the planters all the information which was needed , we decided upon penetrating to the village ; and after a temporary sojourn there , to strike the beach again , and journey round to taloo , a harbour on the opposite side of the island .
melville	omoo	we at once put ourselves in travelling trim . just previous to leaving tahiti , having found my wardrobe reduced to two suits ( frock and trousers , both much the worse for wear ) , i had quilted them together for mutual preservation ( after a fashion peculiar to sailors ) ; engrafting a red frock upon a blue one , and producing thereby a choice variety in the way of clothing . this was the extent of my wardrobe . nor was the doctor by any means better off . his improvidence had at last driven him to don the nautical garb ; but by this time his frock—a light cotton one—had almost given out , and he had nothing to replace it . shorty very generously offered him one which was a little less ragged ; but the alms were proudly refused ; long ghost preferring to assume the ancient costume of tahiti—the “ roora . ”
melville	omoo	this garment , once worn as a festival dress , is now seldom met with ; but captain bob had often shown us one which he kept as an heirloom . it was a cloak , or mantle , of yellow tappa , precisely similar to the “ poncho ” worn by the south-american spaniards . the head being slipped through a slit in the middle , the robe hangs about the person in ample drapery . tonoi obtained sufficient coarse brown tappa to make a short mantle of this description ; and in five minutes the doctor was equipped . zeke , eyeing his toga critically , reminded its proprietor that there were many streams to ford , and precipices to scale , between martair and tamai ; and if he travelled in petticoats , he had better hold them up .
melville	omoo	besides other deficiencies , we were utterly shoeless . in the free and easy pacific , sailors seldom wear shoes ; mine had been tossed overboard the day we met the trades ; and except in one or two tramps ashore , i had never worn any since . in martair , they would have been desirable : but none were to be had . for the expedition we meditated , however , they were indispensable . zeke , being the owner of a pair of huge , dilapidated boots , hanging from a rafter like saddlebags , the doctor succeeded in exchanging for them a case-knife , the last valuable article in his possession . for myself , i made sandals from a bullock ’ s hide , such as are worn by the indians in california . they are made in a minute ; the sole , rudely fashioned to the foot , being confined across the instep by three straps of leather .
melville	omoo	our headgear deserves a passing word . my comrade ’ s was a brave old panama hat , made of grass , almost as fine as threads of silk ; and so elastic that , upon rolling it up , it sprang into perfect shape again . set off by the jaunty slouch of this spanish sombrero , doctor long ghost , in this and his eoora , looked like a mendicant grandee .
melville	omoo	nor was my own appearance in an eastern turban less distinguished . the way i came to wear it was this . my hat having been knocked overboard a few days before reaching papeetee , i was obliged to mount an abominable wad of parti-coloured worsted—what sailors call a scotch cap . everyone knows the elasticity of knit wool ; and this caledonian head-dress crowned my temples so effectually that the confined atmosphere engendered was prejudicial to my curls . in vain i tried to ventilate the cap : every gash made seemed to heal whole in no time . then such a continual chafing as it kept up in a hot sun .
melville	omoo	seeing my dislike to the thing , kooloo , my worthy friend , prevailed upon me to bestow it upon him . i did so ; hinting that a good boiling might restore the original brilliancy of the colours .
melville	omoo	it was then that i mounted the turban . taking a new regatta frock of the doctor ’ s , which was of a gay calico , and winding it round my head in folds , i allowed the sleeves to droop behind—thus forming a good defence against the sun , though in a shower it was best off . the pendent sleeves adding much to the effect , the doctor called me the bashaw with two tails .
melville	omoo	thus arrayed , we were ready for tamai ; in whose green saloons we counted upon creating no small sensation . chapter lxii . tamai long before sunrise the next morning my sandals were laced on , and the doctor had vaulted into zeke ’ s boots .
melville	omoo	expecting to see us again before we went to taloo , the planters wished us a pleasant journey ; and , on parting , very generously presented us with a pound or two of what sailors call “ plug ” tobacco ; telling us to cut it up into small change ; the virginian weed being the principal circulating medium on the island .
melville	omoo	tamai , we were told , was not more than three or four leagues distant ; so making allowances for a wild road , a few hours to rest at noon , and our determination to take the journey leisurely , we counted upon reaching the shores of the lake some time in the flush of the evening .
melville	omoo	for several hours we went on slowly through wood and ravine , and over hill and precipice , seeing nothing but occasional herds of wild cattle , and often resting ; until we found ourselves , about noon , in the very heart of the island .
melville	omoo	it was a green , cool hollow among the mountains , into which we at last descended with a bound . the place was gushing with a hundred springs , and shaded over with great solemn trees , on whose mossy boles the moisture stood in beads . strange to say , no traces of the bullocks ever having been here were revealed . nor was there a sound to be heard , nor a bird to be seen , nor any breath of wind stirring the leaves . the utter solitude and silence were oppressive ; and after peering about under the shades , and seeing nothing but ranks of dark , motionless trunks , we hurried across the hollow , and ascended a steep mountain opposite .
melville	omoo	midway up , we rested where the earth had gathered about the roots of three palms , and thus formed a pleasant lounge , from which we looked down upon the hollow , now one dark green tuft of woodland at our feet . here we brought forth a small calabash of “ poee ” a parting present from tonoi . after eating heartily , we obtained fire by two sticks , and throwing ourselves back , puffed forth our fatigue in wreaths of smoke . at last we fell asleep ; nor did we waken till the sun had sunk so low that its rays darted in upon us under the foliage .
melville	omoo	starting up , we then continued our journey ; and as we gained the mountain top—there , to our surprise , lay the lake and village of tamai . we had thought it a good league off . where we stood , the yellow sunset was still lingering ; but over the valley below long shadows were stealing—the rippling green lake reflecting the houses and trees just as they stood along its banks . several small canoes , moored here and there to posts in the water , were dancing upon the waves ; and one solitary fisherman was paddling over to a grassy point . in front of the houses , groups of natives were seen ; some thrown at full length upon the ground , and others indolently leaning against the bamboos .
melville	omoo	with whoop and halloo , we ran down the hills , the villagers soon hurrying forth to see who were coming . as we drew near , they gathered round , all curiosity to know what brought the “ karhowrees ” into their quiet country . the doctor contriving to make them understand the purely social object of our visit , they gave us a true tahitian welcome ; pointing into their dwellings , and saying they were ours as long as we chose to remain .
melville	omoo	we were struck by the appearance of these people , both men and women ; so much more healthful than the inhabitants of the bays . as for the young girls , they were more retiring and modest , more tidy in their dress , and far fresher and more beautiful than the damsels of the coast . a thousand pities , thought i , that they should bury their charms in this nook of a valley .
melville	omoo	that night we abode in the house of rartoo , a hospitable old chief . it was right on the shore of the lake ; and at supper we looked out through a rustling screen of foliage upon the surface of the starlit water .
melville	omoo	the next day we rambled about , and found a happy little community , comparatively free from many deplorable evils to which the rest of their countrymen are subject . their time , too , was more occupied . to my surprise , the manufacture of tappa was going on in several buildings . european calicoes were seldom seen , and not many articles of foreign origin of any description .
melville	omoo	the people of tamai were nominally christians ; but being so remote from ecclesiastical jurisdiction , their religion sat lightly upon them . we had been told , even , that many heathenish games and dances still secretly lingered in their valley .
melville	omoo	now the prospect of seeing an old-fashioned “ hevar , ” or tahitian reel , was one of the inducements which brought us here ; and so , finding rartoo rather liberal in his religious ideas , we disclosed our desire . at first he demurred ; and shrugging his shoulders like a frenchman , declared it could not be brought about—was a dangerous matter to attempt , and might bring all concerned into trouble . but we overcame all this , convinced him that the thing could be done , and a “ hevar , ” a genuine pagan fandango , was arranged for that very night .
melville	omoo	chapter lxiii . a dance in the valley there were some ill-natured people—tell-tales—it seemed , in tamai ; and hence there was a deal of mystery about getting up the dance . an hour or two before midnight , rartoo entered the house , and , throwing robes of tappa over us , bade us follow at a distance behind him ; and , until out of the village , hood our faces . keenly alive to the adventure , we obeyed . at last , after taking a wide circuit , we came out upon the farthest shore of the lake . it was a wide , dewy , space ; lighted up by a full moon , and carpeted with a minute species of fern growing closely together . it swept right down to the water , showing the village opposite , glistening among the groves .
melville	omoo	near the trees , on one side of the clear space , was a ruinous pile of stones many rods in extent ; upon which had formerly stood a temple of oro . at present , there was nothing but a rude hut , planted on the lowermost terrace . it seemed to have been used as a “ tappa herree , ” or house for making the native cloth .
melville	omoo	here we saw lights gleaming from between the bamboos , and casting long , rod-like shadows upon the ground without . voices also were heard . we went up , and had a peep at the dancers who were getting ready for the ballet . they were some twenty in number ; -waited upon by hideous old crones , who might have been duennas . long ghost proposed to send the latter packing ; but rartoo said it would never do , and so they were permitted to remain .
melville	omoo	we tried to effect an entrance at the door , which was fastened ; but , after a noisy discussion with one of the old witches within , our guide became fidgety , and , at last , told us to desist , or we would spoil all . he then led us off to a distance to await the performance ; as the girls , he said , did not wish to be recognized . he , furthermore , made us promise to remain where we were until all was over , and the dancers had retired .
melville	omoo	we waited impatiently ; and , at last , they came forth . they were arrayed in short tunics of white tappa ; with garlands of flowers on their heads . following them were the duennas , who remained clustering about the house , while the girls advanced a few paces ; and , in an instant , two of them , taller than their companions , were standing , side by side , in the middle of a ring formed by the clasped hands of the rest . this movement was made in perfect silence .
melville	omoo	presently the two girls join hands overhead ; and , crying out , “ ahloo ! ahloo ! ” wave them to and fro . upon which the ring begins to circle slowly ; the dancers moving sideways , with their arms a little drooping . soon they quicken their pace ; and , at last , fly round and round : bosoms heaving , hair streaming , flowers dropping , and every sparkling eye circling in what seemed a line of light .
melville	omoo	meanwhile , the pair within are passing and repassing each other incessantly . inclining sideways , so that their long hair falls far over , they glide this way and that ; one foot continually in the air , and their fingers thrown forth , and twirling in the moonbeams .
melville	omoo	“ ahloo ! ahloo ! ” again cry the dance queens ; and coming together in the middle of the ring , they once more lift up the arch , and stand motionless . “ ahloo ! ahloo ! ” every link of the circle is broken ; and the girls , deeply breathing , stand perfectly still . they pant hard and fast a moment or two ; and then , just as the deep flush is dying away from their faces , slowly recede , all round ; thus enlarging the ring .
melville	omoo	again the two leaders wave their hands , when the rest pause ; and now , far apart , stand in the still moonlight like a circle of fairies . presently , raising a strange chant , they softly sway themselves , gradually quickening the movement , until , at length , for a few passionate moments , with throbbing bosoms and glowing cheeks , they abandon themselves to all the spirit of the dance , apparently lost to everything around . but soon subsiding again into the same languid measure as before , they become motionless ; and then , reeling forward on all sides , their eyes swimming in their heads , join in one wild chorus , and sink into each other ’ s arms .
melville	omoo	such is the lory-lory , i think they call it ; the dance of the backsliding girls of tamai . while it was going on , we had as much as we could do to keep the doctor from rushing forward and seizing a partner .
melville	omoo	they would give us no more “ hevars ” that night ; and rartoo fairly dragged us away to a canoe , hauled up on the lake shore ; when we reluctantly embarked , and paddling over to the village , arrived there in time for a good nap before sunrise .
melville	omoo	the next day , the doctor went about trying to hunt up the overnight dancers . he thought to detect them by their late rising ; but never was man more mistaken ; for , on first sallying out , the whole village was asleep , waking up in concert about an hour after . but , in the course of the day , he came across several whom he at once charged with taking part in the “ hevar. ” there were some prim-looking fellows standing by ( visiting elders from afrehitoo , perhaps ) , and the girls looked embarrassed ; but parried the charge most skilfully .
melville	omoo	though soft as doves , in general , the ladies of tamai are , nevertheless , flavoured with a slight tincture of what we queerly enough call the “ devil ” ; and they showed it on the present occasion . for when the doctor pressed one rather hard , she all at once turned round upon him , and , giving him a box on the ear , told him to “ hanree perrar ! ” ( be off with himself . )
melville	omoo	chapter lxiv . mysterious there was a little old man of a most hideous aspect living in tamai , who , in a coarse mantle of tappa , went about the village , dancing , and singing , and making faces . he followed us about wherever we went ; and , when unobserved by others , plucked at our garments , making frightful signs for us to go along with him somewhere , and see something .
melville	omoo	it was in vain that we tried to get rid of him . kicks and cuffs , even , were at last resorted to ; but , though he howled like one possessed , he would not go away , but still haunted us . at last , we conjured the natives to rid us of him ; but they only laughed ; so we were forced to endure the dispensation as well as we could .
melville	omoo	on the fourth night of our visit , returning home late from paying a few calls through the village , we turned a dark corner of trees , and came full upon our goblin friend : as usual , chattering , and motioning with his hands . the doctor , venting a curse , hurried forward ; but , from some impulse or other , i stood my ground , resolved to find out what this unaccountable object wanted of us . seeing me pause , he crept close up to me , peered into my face , and then retreated , beckoning me to follow ; which i did .
melville	omoo	in a few moments the village was behind us ; and with my guide in advance , i found myself in the shadow of the heights overlooking the farther side of the valley . here my guide paused until i came up with him ; when , side by side , and without speaking , we ascended the hill .
melville	omoo	presently , we came to a wretched hut , barely distinguishable in the shade cast by the neighbouring trees . pushing aside a rude sliding door , held together with thongs , the goblin signed me to enter . within , it looked dark as pitch ; so i gave him to understand that he must strike a light , and go in before me . without replying , he disappeared in the darkness ; and , after groping about , i heard two sticks rubbing together , and directly saw a spark . a native taper was then lighted , and i stooped , and entered .
melville	omoo	it was a mere kennel . foul old mats , and broken cocoa-nut shells , and calabashes were strewn about the floor of earth ; and overhead i caught glimpses of the stars through chinks in the roof . here and there the thatch had fallen through , and hung down in wisps .
melville	omoo	i now told him to set about what he was going to do , or produce whatever he had to show without delay . looking round fearfully , as if dreading a surprise , he commenced turning over and over the rubbish in one corner . at last , he clutched a calabash , stained black , and with the neck broken off ; on one side of it was a large hole . something seemed to be stuffed away in the vessel ; and after a deal of poking at the aperture , a musty old pair of sailor trousers was drawn forth ; and , holding them up eagerly , he inquired how many pieces of tobacco i would give for them .
melville	omoo	without replying , i hurried away ; the old man chasing me , and shouting as i ran , until i gained the village . here i dodged him , and made my way home , resolved never to disclose so inglorious an adventure .
melville	omoo	to no purpose , the next morning , my comrade besought me to enlighten him ; i preserved a mysterious silence . the occurrence served me a good turn , however , so long as we abode in tamai ; for the old clothesman never afterwards troubled me ; but forever haunted the doctor , who , in vain , supplicated heaven to be delivered from him .
melville	omoo	chapter lxv . the hegira , or flight “ i say , doctor , ” cried i , a few days after my adventure with the goblin , as , in the absence of our host , we were one morning lounging upon the matting in his dwelling , smoking our reed pipes , “ tamai ’ s a thriving place ; why not settle down ? ”
melville	omoo	“ faith ! ” said he , “ not a bad idea , paul . but do you fancy they ’ ll let us stay , though ? ” “ why , certainly ; they would be overjoyed to have a couple of karhowrees for townsmen . ”
melville	omoo	“ gad ! you ’ re right , my pleasant fellow . ha ! ha ! i ’ ll put up a banana-leaf as a physician from london—deliver lectures on polynesian antiquities—teach english in five lessons , of one hour each—establish power-looms for the manufacture of tappa—lay out a public park in the middle of the village , and found a festival in honour of captain cook ! ”
melville	omoo	“ but , surely , not without stopping to take breath , ” observed i . the doctor ’ s projects , to be sure , were of a rather visionary cast ; but we seriously thought , nevertheless , of prolonging our stay in the valley for an indefinite period ; and , with this understanding , we were turning over various plans for spending our time pleasantly , when several women came running into the house , and hurriedly besought us to heree ! heree ! ( make our escape ) , crying out something about the mickonarees .
melville	omoo	thinking that we were about to be taken up under the act for the suppression of vagrancy , we flew out of the house , sprang into a canoe before the door , and paddled with might and main over to the opposite side of the lake .
melville	omoo	approaching rartoo ’ s dwelling was a great crowd , among which we perceived several natives , who , from their partly european dress , we were certain did not reside in tamai . plunging into the groves , we thanked our stars that we had thus narrowly escaped being apprehended as runaway seamen , and marched off to the beach . this , at least , was what we thought we had escaped .
melville	omoo	having fled the village , we could not think of prowling about its vicinity , and then returning ; in doing so we might be risking our liberty again . we therefore determined upon journeying back to martair ; and setting our faces thitherward , we reached the planters ’ house about nightfall . they gave us a cordial reception , and a hearty supper ; and we sat up talking until a late hour .
melville	omoo	we now prepared to go round to taloo , a place from which we were not far off when at tamai ; but wishing to see as much of the island as we could , we preferred returning to martair , and then going round by way of the beach .
melville	omoo	taloo , the only frequented harbour of imeeo , lies on the western side of the island , almost directly over against martair . upon one shore of the bay stands the village of partoowye , a missionary station . in its vicinity is an extensive sugar plantation—the best in the south seas , perhaps—worked by a person from sydney .
melville	omoo	the patrimonial property of the husband of pomaree , and every way a delightful retreat , partoowye was one of the occasional residences of the court . but at the time i write of it was permanently fixed there , the queen having fled thither from tahiti .
melville	omoo	partoowye , they told us , was by no means the place papeetee was . ships seldom touched , and very few foreigners were living ashore . a solitary whaler , however , was reported to be lying in the harbour , wooding and watering , and to be in want of men .
melville	omoo	all things considered , i could not help looking upon taloo as offering “ a splendid opening ” for us adventurers . to say nothing of the facilities presented for going to sea in the whaler , or hiring ourselves out as day labourers in the sugar plantation , there were hopes to be entertained of being promoted to some office of high trust and emolument about the person of her majesty , the queen .
melville	omoo	nor was this expectation altogether quixotic . in the train of many polynesian princes roving whites are frequently found : gentleman pensioners of state , basking in the tropical sunshine of the court , and leading the pleasantest lives in the world . upon islands little visited by foreigners the first seaman that settles down is generally domesticated in the family of the head chief or king ; where he frequently discharges the functions of various offices , elsewhere filled by as many different individuals . as historiographer , for instance , he gives the natives some account of distant countries ; as commissioner of the arts and sciences , he instructs them in the use of the jack-knife , and the best way of shaping bits of iron hoop into spear-heads ; and as interpreter to his majesty , he facilitates intercourse with strangers ; besides instructing the people generally in the uses of the most common english phrases , civil and profane ; but oftener the latter .
melville	omoo	these men generally marry well ; often—like hardy of hannamanoo—into the wood royal . sometimes they officiate as personal attendant , or first lord in waiting , to the king . at amboi , one of the tonga islands , a vagabond welshman bends his knee as cupbearer to his cannibal majesty . he mixes his morning cup of “ arva , ” and , with profound genuflections , presents it in a cocoa-nut bowl , richly carved . upon another island of the same group , where it is customary to bestow no small pains in dressing the hair—frizzing it out by a curious process into an enormous pope ’ s head—an old man-of-war ’ s-man fills the post of barber to the king . and as his majesty is not very neat , his mop is exceedingly populous ; so that , when jack is not engaged in dressing the head intrusted to his charge , he busies himself in gently titillating it—a sort of skewer being actually worn about in the patient ’ s hair for that special purpose .
melville	omoo	even upon the sandwich islands a low rabble of foreigners is kept about the person of tammahammaha for the purpose of ministering to his ease or enjoyment . billy loon , a jolly little negro , tricked out in a soiled blue jacket , studded all over with rusty bell buttons , and garnished with shabby gold lace , is the royal drummer and pounder of the tambourine . joe , a wooden-legged portuguese who lost his leg by a whale , is violinist ; and mordecai , as he is called , a villainous-looking scamp , going about with his cups and balls in a side pocket , diverts the court with his jugglery . these idle rascals receive no fixed salary , being altogether dependent upon the casual bounty of their master . now and then they run up a score at the dance houses in honolulu , where the illustrious tammahammaha iii afterwards calls and settles the bill .
melville	omoo	a few years since an auctioneer to his majesty came near being added to the retinue of state . it seems that he was the first man who had practised his vocation in the sandwich islands ; and delighted with the sport of bidding upon his wares , the king was one of his best customers . at last he besought the man to leave all and follow him , and he should be handsomely provided for at court . but the auctioneer refused ; and so the ivory hammer lost the chance of being borne before him on a velvet cushion when the next king went to be crowned .
melville	omoo	but it was not as strolling players , nor as footmen out of employ , that the doctor and myself looked forward to our approaching introduction to the court of the queen of tahiti . on the contrary , as before hinted , we expected to swell the appropriations of bread-fruit and cocoa-nuts on the civil list by filling some honourable office in her gift .
melville	omoo	we were told that , to resist the usurpation of the french , the queen was rallying about her person all the foreigners she could . her partiality for the english and americans was well known ; and this was an additional ground for our anticipating a favourable reception . zeke had informed us , moreover , that by the queen ’ s counsellors at partoowye , a war of aggression against the invaders of papeetee had been seriously thought of . should this prove true , a surgeon ’ s commission for the doctor , and a lieutenancy for myself , were certainly counted upon in our sanguine expectations .
melville	omoo	such , then , were our views , and such our hopes in projecting a trip to taloo . but in our most lofty aspirations we by no means lost sight of any minor matters which might help us to promotion . the doctor had informed me that he excelled in playing the fiddle . i now suggested that , as soon as we arrived at partoowye , we should endeavour to borrow a violin for him ; or if this could not be done , that he should manufacture some kind of a substitute , and , thus equipped , apply for an audience of the queen . her well-known passion for music would at once secure his admittance ; and so , under the most favourable auspices , bring about our introduction to her notice .
melville	omoo	“ and who knows , ” said my waggish comrade , throwing his head back and performing an imaginary air by briskly drawing one arm across the other , “ who knows that i may not fiddle myself into her majesty ’ s good graces so as to became a sort of rizzio to the tahitian princess . ”
melville	omoo	chapter lxvi . how we were to get to taloo the inglorious circumstances of our somewhat premature departure from tamai filled the sagacious doctor , and myself , with sundry misgivings for the future .
melville	omoo	under zeke ’ s protection , we were secure from all impertinent interference in our concerns on the part of the natives . but as friendless wanderers over the island , we ran the risk of being apprehended as runaways , and , as such , sent back to tahiti . the truth is that the rewards constantly offered for the apprehension of deserters from ships induce some of the natives to eye all strangers suspiciously .
melville	omoo	a passport was therefore desirable ; but such a thing had never been heard of in imeeo . at last , long ghost suggested that , as the yankee was well known and much respected all over the island , we should endeavour to obtain from him some sort of paper , not only certifying to our having been in his employ , but also to our not being highwaymen , kidnappers , nor yet runaway seamen . even written in english , a paper like this would answer every purpose ; for the unlettered natives , standing in great awe of the document , would not dare to molest us until acquainted with its purport . then , if it came to the worst , we might repair to the nearest missionary , and have the passport explained .
melville	omoo	upon informing zeke of these matters , he seemed highly flattered with the opinion we entertained of his reputation abroad ; and he agreed to oblige us . the doctor at once offered to furnish him with a draught of the paper ; but he refused , saying he would write it himself . with a rooster ’ s quill , therefore , a bit of soiled paper , and a stout heart , he set to work . evidently he was not accustomed to composition ; for his literary throes were so violent that the doctor suggested that some sort of a caesarian operation might be necessary .
melville	omoo	the precious paper was at last finished ; and a great curiosity it was . we were much diverted with his reasons for not dating it . “ in this here dummed eliminate , ” he observed , “ a feller can ’ t keep the run of the months , nohow ; cause there ’ s no seasons ; no summer and winter , to go by . one ’ s etarnally thinkin ’ it ’ s always july , it ’ s so pesky hot . ”
melville	omoo	a passport provided , we cast about for some means of getting to taloo . the island of imeeo is very nearly surrounded by a regular breakwater of coral extending within a mile or less of the shore . the smooth canal within furnishes the best means of communication with the different settlements ; all of which , with the exception of tamai , are right upon the water . and so indolent are the imeeose that they think nothing of going twenty or thirty miles round the island in a canoe in order to reach a place not a quarter of that distance by land . but as hinted before , the fear of the bullocks has something to do with this .
melville	omoo	the idea of journeying in a canoe struck our fancy quite pleasantly ; and we at once set about chartering one , if possible . but none could we obtain . for not only did we have nothing to pay for hiring one , but we could not expect to have it loaned ; inasmuch as the good-natured owner would , in all probability , have to walk along the beach as we paddled in order to bring back his property when we had no further use for it .
melville	omoo	at last , it was decided to commence our journey on foot ; trusting that we would soon fall in with a canoe going our way , in which we might take passage .
melville	omoo	the planters said we would find no beaten path : all we had to do was to follow the beach ; and however inviting it might look inland , on no account must we stray from it . in short , the longest way round was the nearest way to taloo . at intervals , there were little hamlets along the shore , besides lonely fishermen ’ s huts here and there , where we could get plenty to eat without pay ; so there was no necessity to lay in any store .
melville	omoo	intending to be off before sunrise the next morning , so as to have the benefit of the coolest part of the day , we bade our kind hosts farewell overnight ; and then , repairing to the beach , we launched our floating pallet , and slept away merrily till dawn .
melville	omoo	chapter lxvii . the journey round the beach it was on the fourth day of the first month of the hegira , or flight from tamai ( we now reckoned our time thus ) , that , rising bright and early , we were up and away out of the valley of martair before the fishermen even were stirring .
melville	omoo	it was the earliest dawn . the morning only showed itself along the lower edge of a bank of purple clouds pierced by the misty peaks of tahiti . the tropical day seemed too languid to rise . sometimes , starting fitfully , it decked the clouds with faint edgings of pink and gray , which , fading away , left all dim again . anon , it threw out thin , pale rays , growing lighter and lighter , until at last , the golden morning sprang out of the east with a bound—darting its bright beams hither and thither , higher and higher , and sending them , broadcast , over the face of the heavens .
melville	omoo	all balmy from the groves of tahiti came an indolent air , cooled by its transit over the waters ; and grateful underfoot was the damp and slightly yielding beach , from which the waves seemed just retired .
melville	omoo	the doctor was in famous spirits ; removing his koora , he went splashing into the sea ; and , after swimming a few yards , waded ashore , hopping , skipping , and jumping along the beach ; but very careful to cut all his capers in the direction of our journey .
melville	omoo	say what they will of the glowing independence one feels in the saddle , give me the first morning flush of your cheery pedestrian ! thus exhilarated , we went on , as light-hearted and care-free as we could wish .
melville	omoo	and here i can not refrain from lauding the very superior inducements which most intertropical countries afford , not only to mere rovers like ourselves , but to penniless people generally . in these genial regions one ’ s wants are naturally diminished ; and those which remain are easily gratified ; fuel , house-shelter , and , if you please , clothing , may be entirely dispensed with .
melville	omoo	how different our hard northern latitudes ! alas ! the lot of a “ poor devil , ” twenty degrees north of the tropic of cancer , is indeed pitiable . at last , the beach contracted to hardly a yard ’ s width , and the dense thicket almost dipped into the sea . in place of the smooth sand , too , we had sharp fragments of broken coral , which made travelling exceedingly unpleasant . “ lord ! my foot ! ” roared the doctor , fetching it up for inspection , with a galvanic fling of the limb . a sharp splinter had thrust itself into the flesh through a hole in his boot . my sandals were worse yet ; their soles taking a sort of fossil impression of everything trod upon .
melville	omoo	turning round a bold sweep of the beach , we came upon a piece of fine , open ground , with a fisherman ’ s dwelling in the distance , crowning a knoll which rolled off into the water .
melville	omoo	the hut proved to be a low , rude erection , very recently thrown up ; for the bamboos were still green as grass , and the thatching fresh and fragrant as meadow hay . it was open upon three sides ; so that , upon drawing near , the domestic arrangements within were in plain sight . no one was stirring ; and nothing was to be seen but a clumsy old chest of native workmanship , a few calabashes , and bundles of tappa hanging against a post ; and a heap of something , we knew not what , in a dark corner . upon close inspection , the doctor discovered it to be a loving old couple , locked in each other ’ s arms , and rolled together in a tappa mantle .
melville	omoo	“ halloa ! darby ! ” he cried , shaking the one with a beard . but darby heeded him not ; though joan , a wrinkled old body , started up in affright , and yelled aloud . neither of us attempting to gag her , she presently became quiet ; and , after staring hard and asking some unintelligible questions , she proceeded to rouse her still slumbering mate .
melville	omoo	what ailed him we could not tell ; but there was no waking him . equally in vain were all his dear spouse ’ s cuffs , pinches , and other endearments ; he lay like a log , face up , snoring away like a cavalry trumpeter .
melville	omoo	“ here , my good woman , ” said long ghost , “ just let me try ” ; and , taking the patient right by his nose , he so lifted him bodily into a sitting position , and held him there until his eyes opened . when this event came to pass , darby looked round like one stupefied ; and then , springing to his feet , backed away into a corner , from which place we became the objects of his earnest and respectful attention .
melville	omoo	“ permit me , my dear darby , to introduce to you my esteemed friend and comrade , paul , ” said the doctor , gallanting me up with all the grimace and flourish imaginable . upon this , darby began to recover his faculties , and surprised us not a little by talking a few words of english . so far as could be understood , they were expressive of his having been aware that there were two “ karhowrees ” in the neighbourhood ; that he was glad to see us , and would have something for us to eat in no time .
melville	omoo	how he came by his english was explained to us before we left . some time previous , he had been a denizen of papeetee , where the native language is broidered over with the most classic sailor phrases . he seemed to be quite proud of his residence there ; and alluded to it in the same significant way in which a provincial informs you that in his time he has resided in the capital . the old fellow was disposed to be garrulous ; but being sharp-set , we told him to get breakfast ; after which we would hear his anecdotes . while employed among the calabashes , the strange , antiquated fondness between these old semi-savages was really amusing . i made no doubt that they were saying to each other , “ yes , my love ” — “ no , my life , ” just in the same way that some young couples do , at home .
melville	omoo	they gave us a hearty meal ; and while we were discussing its merits , they assured us , over and over again , that they expected nothing in return for their attentions ; more : we were at liberty to stay as long as we pleased ; and as long as we did stay , their house and everything they had was no longer theirs , but ours ; still more : they themselves were our slaves—the old lady , to a degree that was altogether superfluous . this , now , is tahitian hospitality ! self-immolation upon one ’ s own hearthstone for the benefit of the guest .
melville	omoo	the polynesians carry their hospitality to an amazing extent . let a native of waiurar , the westernmost part of tahiti , make his appearance as a traveller at partoowye , the most easterly village of imeeo ; though a perfect stranger , the inhabitants on all sides accost him at their doorways , inviting him to enter , and make himself at home . but the traveller passes on , examining every house attentively ; until , at last , he pauses before one which suits him , and then exclaiming , “ ah , eda maitai ” ( this one will do , i think ) , he steps in , and makes himself perfectly at ease ; flinging himself upon the mats , and very probably calling for a nice young cocoa-nut , and a piece of toasted breadfruit , sliced thin , and done brown .
melville	omoo	curious to relate , however , should a stranger carrying it thus bravely be afterwards discovered to be without a house of his own , why , he may thenceforth go a-begging for his lodgings . the “ karhowrees , ” or white men , are exceptions to this rule . thus it is precisely as in civilized countries , where those who have houses and lands are incessantly bored to death with invitations to come and live in other people ’ s houses ; while many a poor gentleman who inks the seams of his coat , and to whom the like invitation would be really acceptable , may go and sue for it . but to the credit of the ancient tahitians , it should here be observed that this blemish upon their hospitality is only of recent origin , and was wholly unknown in old times . so told me , captain bob .
melville	omoo	in polynesia it is esteemed “ a great hit ” if a man succeed in marrying into a family to which the best part of the community is related ( heaven knows it is otherwise with us ) . the reason is that , when he goes a-travelling , the greater number of houses are the more completely at his service .
melville	omoo	receiving a paternal benediction from old darby and joan , we continued our journey ; resolved to stop at the very next place of attraction which offered . nor did we long stroll for it . a fine walk along a beach of shells , and we came to a spot where , trees here and there , the land was all meadow , sloping away to the water , which stirred a sedgy growth of reeds bordering its margin . close by was a little cove , walled in with coral , where a fleet of canoes was dancing up and down . a few paces distant , on a natural terrace overlooking the sea , were several native dwellings , newly thatched , and peeping into view out of the foliage like summer-houses .
melville	omoo	as we drew near , forth came a burst of voices , and , presently , three gay girls , overflowing with life , health , and youth , and full of spirits and mischief . one was arrayed in a flaunting robe of calico ; and her long black hair was braided behind in two immense tresses , joined together at the ends , and wreathed with the green tendrils of a vine . from her self-possessed and forward air , i fancied she might be some young lady from papeetee on a visit to her country relations . her companions wore mere slips of cotton cloth ; their hair was dishevelled ; and though very pretty , they betrayed the reserve and embarrassment characteristic of the provinces .
melville	omoo	the little gipsy first mentioned ran up to me with great cordiality ; and , giving the tahitian salutation , opened upon me such a fire of questions that there was no understanding , much less answering them . but our hearty welcome to loohooloo , as she called the hamlet , was made plain enough . meanwhile , doctor long ghost gallantly presented an arm to each of the other young ladies ; which , at first , they knew not what to make of ; but at last , taking it for some kind of joke , accepted the civility .
melville	omoo	the names of these three damsels were at once made known by themselves : and being so exceedingly romantic , i can not forbear particularizing them . upon my comrade ’ s arms , then , were hanging night and morning , in the persons of farnowar , or the day-born , and earnoopoo , or the night-born . she with the tresses was very appropriately styled marhar-rarrar , the wakeful , or bright-eyed .
melville	omoo	by this time , the houses were emptied of the rest of their inmates—a few old men and women , and several strapping young fellows rubbing their eyes and yawning . all crowded round , putting questions as to whence we came . upon being informed of our acquaintance with zeke , they were delighted ; and one of them recognized the boots worn by the doctor . “ keekee ( zeke ) maitai , ” they cried , “ nuee nuee hanna hanna portarto ” — ( makes plenty of potatoes ) .
melville	omoo	there was now a little friendly altercation as to who should have the honour of entertaining the strangers . at last , a tall old gentleman , by name marharvai , with a bald head and white beard , took us each by the hand , and led us into his dwelling . once inside , marharvai , pointing about with his staff , was so obsequious in assuring us that his house was ours that long ghost suggested he might as well hand over the deed .
melville	omoo	it was drawing near noon ; so after a light lunch of roasted breadfruit , a few whiffs of a pipe , and some lively chatting , our host admonished the company to lie down , and take the everlasting siesta . we complied ; and had a social nap all round .
melville	omoo	chapter lxviii . a dinner-party in imeeo it was just in the middle of the merry , mellow afternoon that they ushered us to dinner , underneath a green shelter of palm boughs ; open all round , and so low at the eaves that we stooped to enter .
melville	omoo	within , the ground was strewn over with aromatic ferns—called “ nahee ” —freshly gathered ; which , stirred underfoot , diffused the sweetest odour . on one side was a row of yellow mats , inwrought with fibres of bark stained a bright red . here , seated after the fashion of the turk , we looked out , over a verdant bank , upon the mild , blue , endless pacific . so far round had we skirted the island that the view of tahiti was now intercepted .
melville	omoo	upon the ferns before us were laid several layers of broad , thick “ pooroo ” leaves ; lapping over , one upon the other . and upon these were placed , side by side , newly-plucked banana leaves , at least two yards in length , and very wide ; the stalks were withdrawn so as to make them lie flat . this green cloth was set out and garnished in the manner following : —
melville	omoo	first , a number of “ pooroo ” leaves , by way of plates , were ranged along on one side ; and by each was a rustic nut-bowl , half-filled with sea-water , and a tahitian roll , or small bread-fruit , roasted brown . an immense flat calabash , placed in the centre , was heaped up with numberless small packages of moist , steaming leaves : in each was a small fish , baked in the earth , and done to a turn . this pyramid of a dish was flanked on either side by an ornamental calabash . one was brimming with the golden-hued “ poee , ” or pudding , made from the red plantain of the mountains : the other was stacked up with cakes of the indian turnip , previously macerated in a mortar , kneaded with the milk of the cocoa-nut , and then baked . in the spaces between the three dishes were piled young cocoa-nuts , stripped of their husks . their eyes had been opened and enlarged ; so that each was a ready-charged goblet .
melville	omoo	there was a sort of side-cloth in one corner , upon which , in bright , buff jackets , lay the fattest of bananas ; “ avees , ” red-ripe : guavas with the shadows of their crimson pulp flushing through a transparent skin , and almost coming and going there like blushes ; oranges , tinged , here and there , berry-brown ; and great , jolly melons , which rolled about in very portliness . such a heap ! all ruddy , ripe , and round—bursting with the good cheer of the tropical soil from which they sprang !
melville	omoo	“ a land of orchards ! ” cried the doctor , in a rapture ; and he snatched a morsel from a sort of fruit of which gentlemen of the sanguine temperament are remarkably fond ; namely , the ripe cherry lips of misa day-born , who stood looking on .
melville	omoo	marharvai allotted seats to his guests ; and the meal began . thinking that his hospitality needed some acknowledgment , i rose , and pledged him in the vegetable wine of the cocoa-nut ; merely repeating the ordinary salutation , “ yar onor boyoee. ” sensible that some compliment , after the fashion of white men , was paid him , with a smile , and a courteous flourish of the hand , he bade me be seated . no people , however refined , are more easy and graceful in their manners than the imeeose .
melville	omoo	the doctor , sitting next our host , now came under his special protection . laying before his guest one of the packages of fish , marharvai opened it ; and commended its contents to his particular regards . but my comrade was one of those who , on convivial occasions , can always take care of themselves . he ate an indefinite number of “ pee-hee lee lees ” ( small fish ) , his own and next neighbour ’ s bread-fruit ; and helped himself , to right and left , with all the ease of an accomplished diner-out .
melville	omoo	“ paul , ” said he , at last , “ you don ’ t seem to be getting along ; why don ’ t you try the pepper sauce ? ” and , by way of example , he steeped a morsel of food into his nutful of sea-water . on following suit , i found it quite piquant , though rather bitter ; but , on the whole , a capital substitute for salt . the imeeose invariably use sea-water in this way , deeming it quite a treat ; and considering that their country is surrounded by an ocean of catsup , the luxury can not be deemed an expensive one .
melville	omoo	the fish were delicious ; the manner of cooking them in the ground preserving all the juices , and rendering them exceedingly sweet and tender . the plantain pudding was almost cloying ; the cakes of indian turnip , quite palatable ; and the roasted bread-fruit , crisp as toast .
melville	omoo	during the meal , a native lad walked round and round the party , carrying a long staff of bamboo . this he occasionally tapped upon the cloth , before each guest ; when a white clotted substance dropped forth , with a savour not unlike that of a curd . this proved to be “ lownee , ” an excellent relish , prepared from the grated meat of ripe cocoa-nuts , moistened with cocoa-nut milk and salt water , and kept perfectly tight until a little past the saccharine stage of fermentation .
melville	omoo	throughout the repast there was much lively chatting among the islanders , in which their conversational powers quite exceeded ours . the young ladies , too , showed themselves very expert in the use of their tongues , and contributed much to the gaiety which prevailed .
melville	omoo	nor did these lively nymphs suffer the meal to languish ; for upon the doctor ’ s throwing himself back , with an air of much satisfaction , they sprang to their feet , and pelted him with oranges and guavas . this , at last , put an end to the entertainment .
melville	omoo	by a hundred whimsical oddities , my long friend became a great favourite with these people ; and they bestowed upon him a long , comical title , expressive of his lank figure and koora combined . the latter , by the bye , never failed to excite the remark of everybody we encountered .
melville	omoo	the giving of nicknames is quite a passion with the people of tahiti and imeeo . no one with any peculiarity , whether of person or temper , is exempt ; not even strangers .
melville	omoo	a pompous captain of a man-of-war , visiting tahiti for the second time , discovered that , among the natives , he went by the dignified title of “ atee poee ” —literally , poee head , or pudding head . nor is the highest rank among themselves any protection . the first husband of the present queen was commonly known in the court circles as “ pot belly. ” he carried the greater part of his person before him , to be sure ; and so did the gentlemanly george iv.—but what a title for a king consort !
melville	omoo	even “ pomaree ” itself , the royal patronymic , was , originally , a mere nickname ; and literally signifies , one talking through his nose . the first monarch of that name , being on a war party , and sleeping overnight among the mountains , awoke one morning with a cold in his head ; and some wag of a courtier had no more manners than to vulgarize him thus .
melville	omoo	how different from the volatile polynesian in this , as in all other respects , is our grave and decorous north american indian . while the former bestows a name in accordance with some humorous or ignoble trait , the latter seizes upon what is deemed the most exalted or warlike : and hence , among the red tribes , we have the truly patrician appellations of “ white eagles , ” “ young oaks , ” “ fiery eyes , ” and “ bended bows . ”
melville	omoo	chapter lxix . the cocoa-palm while the doctor and the natives were taking a digestive nap after dinner , i strolled forth to have a peep at the country which could produce so generous a meal .
melville	omoo	to my surprise , a fine strip of land in the vicinity of the hamlet , and protected seaward by a grove of cocoa-nut and bread-fruit trees , was under high cultivation . sweet potatoes , indian turnips , and yams were growing ; also melons , a few pine-apples , and other fruits . still more pleasing was the sight of young bread-fruit and cocoa-nut trees set out with great care , as if , for once , the improvident polynesian had thought of his posterity . but this was the only instance of native thrift which ever came under my observation . for , in all my rambles over tahiti and imeeo , nothing so much struck me as the comparative scarcity of these trees in many places where they ought to abound . entire valleys , like martair , of inexhaustible fertility are abandoned to all the rankness of untamed vegetation . alluvial flats bordering the sea , and watered by streams from the mountains , are over-grown with a wild , scrub guava-bush , introduced by foreigners , and which spreads with such fatal rapidity that the natives , standing still while it grows , anticipate its covering the entire island . even tracts of clear land , which , with so little pains , might be made to wave with orchards , lie wholly neglected .
melville	omoo	when i considered their unequalled soil and climate , thus unaccountably slighted , i often turned in amazement upon the natives about papeetee ; some of whom all but starve in their gardens run to waste . upon other islands which i have visited , of similar fertility , and wholly unreclaimed from their first-discovered condition , no spectacle of this sort was presented .
melville	omoo	the high estimation in which many of their fruit-trees are held by the tahitians and imeeose—their beauty in the landscape—their manifold uses , and the facility with which they are propagated , are considerations which render the remissness alluded to still more unaccountable . the cocoa-palm is as an example ; a tree by far the most important production of nature in the tropics . to the polynesians it is emphatically the tree of life ; transcending even the bread-fruit in the multifarious uses to which it is applied .
melville	omoo	its very aspect is imposing . asserting its supremacy by an erect and lofty bearing , it may be said to compare with other trees as man with inferior creatures . the blessings it confers are incalculable . year after year , the islander reposes beneath its shade , both eating and drinking of its fruit ; he thatches his hut with its boughs , and weaves them into baskets to carry his food ; he cools himself with a fan platted from the young leaflets , and shields his head from the sun by a bonnet of the leaves ; sometimes he clothes himself with the cloth-like substance which wraps round the base of the stalks , whose elastic rods , strung with filberts , are used as a taper ; the larger nuts , thinned and polished , furnish him with a beautiful goblet : the smaller ones , with bowls for his pipes ; the dry husks kindle his fires ; their fibres are twisted into fishing-lines and cords for his canoes ; he heals his wounds with a balsam compounded from the juice of the nut ; and with the oil extracted from its meat embalms the bodies of the dead .
melville	omoo	the noble trunk itself is far from being valueless . sawn into posts , it upholds the islander ’ s dwelling ; converted into charcoal , it cooks his food ; and supported on blocks of stone , rails in his lands . he impels his canoe through the water with a paddle of the wood , and goes to battle with clubs and spears of the same hard material .
melville	omoo	in pagan tahiti a cocoa-nut branch was the symbol of regal authority . laid upon the sacrifice in the temple , it made the offering sacred ; and with it the priests chastised and put to flight the evil spirits which assailed them . the supreme majesty of oro , the great god of their mythology , was declared in the cocoa-nut log from which his image was rudely carved . upon one of the tonga islands , there stands a living tree revered itself as a deity . even upon the sandwich islands , the cocoa-palm retains all its ancient reputation ; the people there having thought of adopting it as the national emblem .
melville	omoo	the cocoa-nut is planted as follows : selecting a suitable place , you drop into the ground a fully ripe nut , and leave it . in a few days , a thin , lance-like shoot forces itself through a minute hole in the shell , pierces the husk , and soon unfolds three pale-green leaves in the air ; while originating , in the same soft white sponge which now completely fills the nut , a pair of fibrous roots , pushing away the stoppers which close two holes in an opposite direction , penetrate the shell , and strike vertically into the ground . a day or two more , and the shell and husk , which , in the last and germinating stage of the nut , are so hard that a knife will scarcely make any impression , spontaneously burst by some force within ; and , henceforth , the hardy young plant thrives apace ; and needing no culture , pruning , or attention of any sort , rapidly advances to maturity . in four or five years it bears ; in twice as many more , it begins to lift its head among the groves , where , waxing strong , it flourishes for near a century .
melville	omoo	thus , as some voyager has said , the man who but drops one of these nuts into the ground may be said to confer a greater and more certain benefit upon himself and posterity than many a life ’ s toil in less genial climes .
melville	omoo	the fruitfulness of the tree is remarkable . as long as it lives it bears , and without intermission . two hundred nuts , besides innumerable white blossoms of others , may be seen upon it at one time ; and though a whole year is required to bring any one of them to the germinating point , no two , perhaps , are at one time in precisely the same stage of growth .
melville	omoo	the tree delights in a maritime situation . in its greatest perfection , it is perhaps found right on the seashore , where its roots are actually washed . but such instances are only met with upon islands where the swell of the sea is prevented from breaking on the beach by an encircling reef . no saline flavour is perceptible in the nut produced in such a place . although it bears in any soil , whether upland or bottom , it does not flourish vigorously inland ; and i have frequently observed that , when met with far up the valley , its tall stem inclines seaward , as if pining after a more genial region .
melville	omoo	it is a curious fact that if you deprive the cocoa-nut tree of the verdant tuft at its head , it dies at once ; and if allowed to stand thus , the trunk , which , when alive , is encased in so hard a bark as to be almost impervious to a bullet , moulders away , and , in an incredibly short period , becomes dust . this is , perhaps , partly owing to the peculiar constitution of the trunk , a mere cylinder of minute hollow reeds , closely packed , and very hard ; but , when exposed at top , peculiarly fitted to convey moisture and decay through the entire stem .
melville	omoo	the finest orchard of cocoa-palms i know , and the only plantation of them i ever saw at the islands , is one that stands right upon the southern shore of papeetee bay . they were set out by the first pomaree , almost half a century ago ; and the soil being especially adapted to their growth , the noble trees now form a magnificent grove , nearly a mile in extent . no other plant , scarcely a bush , is to be seen within its precincts . the broom road passes through its entire length .
melville	omoo	at noonday , this grove is one of the most beautiful , serene , witching places that ever was seen . high overhead are ranges of green rustling arches ; through which the sun ’ s rays come down to you in sparkles . you seem to be wandering through illimitable halls of pillars ; everywhere you catch glimpses of stately aisles , intersecting each other at all points . a strange silence , too , reigns far and near ; the air flushed with the mellow stillness of a sunset .
melville	omoo	but after the long morning calms , the sea-breeze comes in ; and creeping over the tops of these thousand trees , they nod their plumes . soon the breeze freshens ; and you hear the branches brushing against each other ; and the flexible trunks begin to sway . toward evening the whole grove is rocking to and fro ; and the traveller on the broom road is startled by the frequent falling of the nuts , snapped from their brittle stems . they come flying through the air , ringing like jugglers ’ balls ; and often bound along the ground for many rods .
melville	omoo	chapter lxx . life at loohooloo finding the society at loohooloo very pleasant , the young ladies , in particular , being extremely sociable ; and , moreover , in love with the famous good cheer of old marharvai , we acquiesced in an invitation of his to tarry a few days longer . we might then , he said , join a small canoe party which was going to a place a league or two distant . so averse to all exertion are these people that they really thought the prospect of thus getting rid of a few miles ’ walking would prevail with us , even if there were no other inducement .
melville	omoo	the people of the hamlet , as we soon discovered , formed a snug little community of cousins ; of which our host seemed the head . marharvai , in truth , was a petty chief who owned the neighbouring lands . and as the wealthy , in most cases , rejoice in a numerous kindred , the family footing upon which everybody visited him was , perhaps , ascribable to the fact of his being the lord of the manor . like captain bob , he was , in some things , a gentleman of the old school—a stickler for the customs of a past and pagan age .
melville	omoo	nowhere else , except in tamai , did we find the manners of the natives less vitiated by recent changes . the old-fashioned tahitian dinner they gave us on the day of our arrival was a fair sample of their general mode of living .
melville	omoo	our time passed delightfully . the doctor went his way , and i mine . with a pleasant companion , he was forever strolling inland , ostensibly to collect botanical specimens ; while i , for the most part , kept near the sea ; sometimes taking the girls on an aquatic excursion in a canoe .
melville	omoo	often we went fishing ; not dozing over stupid hooks and lines , but leaping right into the water , and chasing our prey over the coral rocks , spear in hand . spearing fish is glorious sport . the imeeose , all round the island , catch them in no other way . the smooth shallows between the reef and the shore , and , at low water , the reef itself , being admirably adapted to this mode of capturing them . at almost any time of the day—save ever the sacred hour of noon—you may see the fish-hunters pursuing their sport ; with loud halloos , brandishing their spears , and splashing through the water in all directions . sometimes a solitary native is seen , far out upon a lonely shallow , wading slowly along , with eye intent and poised spear .
melville	omoo	but the best sport of all is going out upon the great reef itself by torch-light . the natives follow this recreation with as much spirit as a gentleman of england does the chase ; and take full as much delight in it .
melville	omoo	the torch is nothing more than a bunch of dry reeds , bound firmly together : the spear , a long , light pole , with an iron head , on one side barbed . i shall never forget the night that old marharvai and the rest of us , paddling off to the reef , leaped at midnight upon the coral ledges with waving torches and spears . we were more than a mile from the land ; the sullen ocean , thundering upon the outside of the rocks , dashed the spray in our faces , almost extinguishing the flambeaux ; and , far as the eye could reach , the darkness of sky and water was streaked with a long , misty line of foam , marking the course of the coral barrier . the wild fishermen , flourishing their weapons , and yelling like so many demons to scare their prey , sprang from ledge to ledge , and sometimes darted their spears in the very midst of the breakers .
melville	omoo	but fish-spearing was not the only sport we had at loohooloo . right on the beach was a mighty old cocoa-nut tree , the roots of which had been underwashed by the waves so that the trunk inclined far over its base . from the tuft of the tree a stout cord of bark depended , the end of which swept the water several yards from the shore . this was a tahitian swing . a native lad seizes hold of the cord , and , after swinging to and fro quite leisurely , all at once sends himself fifty or sixty feet from the water , rushing through the air like a rocket . i doubt whether any of our rope-dancers would attempt the feat . for my own part , i had neither head nor heart for it ; so , after sending a lad aloft with an additional cord , by way of security , i constructed a large basket of green boughs , in which i and some particular friends of mine used to swing over sea and land by the hour .
melville	omoo	chapter lxxi . we start for taloo bright was the morning , and brighter still the smiles of the young ladies who accompanied us , when we sprang into a sort of family canoe—wide and roomy—and bade adieu to the hospitable marharvai and his tenantry . as we paddled away , they stood upon the beach , waving their hands , and crying out , “ aroha ! aroha ! ” ( farewell ! farewell ! ) as long as we were within hearing .
melville	omoo	very sad at parting with them , we endeavoured , nevertheless , to console ourselves in the society of our fellow-passengers . among these were two old ladies ; but as they said nothing to us , we will say nothing about them ; nor anything about the old men who managed the canoe . but of the three mischievous , dark-eyed young witches who lounged in the stern of that comfortable old island gondola , i have a great deal to say .
melville	omoo	in the first place , one of them was marhar-rarrar , the bright-eyed ; and , in the second place , neither she nor the romps , her companions , ever dreamed of taking the voyage until the doctor and myself announced our intention ; their going along was nothing more than a madcap frolic ; in short , they were a parcel of wicked hoydens , bent on mischief , who laughed in your face when you looked sentimental , and only tolerated your company when making merry at your expense .
melville	omoo	something or other about us was perpetually awaking their mirth . attributing this to his own remarkable figure , the doctor increased their enjoyment by assuming the part of a merry andrew . yet his cap and bells never jingled but to some tune ; and while playing the tom-fool , i more than suspected that he was trying to play the rake . at home , it is deemed auspicious to go a-wooing in epaulets ; but among the polynesians , your best dress in courting is motley .
melville	omoo	a fresh breeze springing up , we set our sail of matting , and glided along as tranquilly as if floating upon an inland stream ; the white reef on one hand , and the green shore on the other .
melville	omoo	soon , as we turned a headland , we encountered another canoe , paddling with might and main in an opposite direction ; the strangers shouting to each other , and a tall fellow in the bow dancing up and down like a crazy man . they shot by us like an arrow , though our fellow-voyagers shouted again and again for them to cease paddling .
melville	omoo	according to the natives , this was a kind of royal mail-canoe , carrying a message from the queen to her friends in a distant part of the island . passing several shady bowers which looked quite inviting , we proposed touching , and diversifying the monotony of a sea-voyage by a stroll ashore . so , forcing our canoe among the bushes , behind a decayed palm lying partly in the water , we left the old folks to take a nap in the shade , and gallanted the others among the trees , which were here trellised with vines and creeping shrubs .
melville	omoo	in the early part of the afternoon , we drew near the place to which the party were going . it was a solitary house inhabited by four or five old women , who , when we entered , were gathered in a circle about the mats , eating poee from a cracked calabash . they seemed delighted at seeing our companions , but rather drew up when introduced to ourselves . eyeing us distrustfully , they whispered to know who we were . the answers they received were not satisfactory ; for they treated us with marked coolness and reserve , and seemed desirous of breaking off our acquaintance with the girls . unwilling , therefore , to stay where our company was disagreeable , we resolved to depart without even eating a meal .
melville	omoo	informed of this , marhar-rarrar and her companions evinced the most lively concern ; and equally unmindful of their former spirits , and the remonstrances of the old ladies , broke forth into sobs and lamentations which were not to be withstood . we agreed , therefore , to tarry until they left for home ; which would be at the “ aheharar , ” or falling of the sun ; in other words , at sunset .
melville	omoo	when the hour arrived , after much leave-taking , we saw them safely embarked . as the canoe turned a bluff , they seized the paddles from the hands of the old men , and waved them silently in the air . this was meant for a touching farewell , as the paddle is only waved thus when the parties separating never more expect to meet .
melville	omoo	we now continued our journey ; and , following the beach , soon came to a level and lofty overhanging bank , which , planted here and there with trees , took a broad sweep round a considerable part of the island .
melville	omoo	a fine pathway skirted the edge of the bank ; and often we paused to admire the scenery . the evening was still and fair , even for so heavenly a climate ; and all round , as far as the eye could reach , was the blending blue sky and ocean .
melville	omoo	as we went on , the reef-belt still accompanied us ; turning as we turned , and thundering its distant bass upon the ear , like the unbroken roar of a cataract . dashing forever against their coral rampart , the breakers looked , in the distance , like a line of rearing white chargers , reined in , tossing their white manes , and bridling with foam .
melville	omoo	these great natural breakwaters are admirably designed for the protection of the land . nearly all the society islands are defended by them . were the vast swells of the pacific to break against the soft alluvial bottoms which in many places border the sea , the soil would soon be washed away , and the natives be thus deprived of their most productive lands . as it is , the banks of no rivulet are firmer .
melville	omoo	but the coral barriers answer another purpose . they form all the harbours of this group , including the twenty-four round about the shores of tahiti . curiously enough , the openings in the reefs , by which alone vessels enter to their anchorage , are invariably opposite the mouths of running streams : an advantage fully appreciated by the mariner who touches for the purpose of watering his ship .
melville	omoo	it is said that the fresh water of the land , mixing with the salts held in solution by the sea , so acts upon the latter as to resist the formation of the coral ; and hence the breaks . here and there , these openings are sentinelled , as it were , by little fairy islets , green as emerald , and waving with palms . strangely and beautifully diversifying the long line of breakers , no objects can strike the fancy more vividly . pomaree ii. , with a taste in watering-places truly tahitian , selected one of them as a royal retreat . we passed it on our journey .
melville	omoo	omitting several further adventures which befell us after leaving the party from loohooloo , we must now hurry on to relate what happened just before reaching the place of our destination .
melville	omoo	chapter lxxii . a dealer in the contraband it must have been at least the tenth day , reckoning from the hegira , that we found ourselves the guests of varvy , an old hermit of an islander who kept house by himself perhaps a couple of leagues from taloo .
melville	omoo	a stone ’ s-cast from the beach there was a fantastic rock , moss-grown and deep in a dell . it was insulated by a shallow brook , which , dividing its waters , flowed on both sides until united below . twisting its roots round the rock , a gnarled “ aoa ” spread itself overhead in a wilderness of foliage ; the elastic branch-roots depending from the larger boughs insinuating themselves into every cleft , thus forming supports to the parent stem . in some places these pendulous branches , half-grown , had not yet reached the rock ; swinging their loose fibrous ends in the air like whiplashes .
melville	omoo	varvy ’ s hut , a mere coop of bamboos , was perched upon a level part of the rock , the ridge-pole resting at one end in a crotch of the “ aoa , ” and the other propped by a forked bough planted in a fissure .
melville	omoo	notwithstanding our cries as we drew near , the first hint the old hermit received of our approach was the doctor ’ s stepping up and touching his shoulder , as he was kneeling over on a stone cleaning fish in the brook . he leaped up , and stared at us . but with a variety of uncouth gestures , he soon made us welcome ; informing us , by the same means , that he was both deaf and dumb ; he then motioned us into his dwelling .
melville	omoo	going in , we threw ourselves upon an old mat , and peered round . the soiled bamboos and calabashes looked so uninviting that the doctor was for pushing on to taloo that night , notwithstanding it was near sunset . but at length we concluded to stay where we were .
melville	omoo	after a good deal of bustling outside under a decrepit shed , the old man made his appearance with our supper . in one hand he held a flickering taper , and in the other , a huge , flat calabash , scantily filled with viands . his eyes were dancing in his head , and he looked from the calabash to us , and from us to the calabash , as much as to say , “ ah , my lads , what do ye think of this , eh ? pretty good cheer , eh ? ” but the fish and indian turnip being none of the best , we made but a sorry meal . while discussing it , the old man tried hard to make himself understood by signs ; most of which were so excessively ludicrous that we made no doubt he was perpetrating a series of pantomimic jokes .
melville	omoo	the remnants of the feast removed , our host left us for a moment , returning with a calabash of portly dimensions and furnished with a long , hooked neck , the mouth of which was stopped with a wooden plug . it was covered with particles of earth , and looked as if just taken from some place underground .
melville	omoo	with sundry winks and horrible giggles peculiar to the dumb , the vegetable demijohn was now tapped ; the old fellow looking round cautiously , and pointing at it ; as much as to intimate that it contained something which was “ taboo , ” or forbidden .
melville	omoo	aware that intoxicating liquors were strictly prohibited to the natives , we now watched our entertainer with much interest . charging a cocoa-nut shell , he tossed it off , and then filling up again , presented the goblet to me . disliking the smell , i made faces at it ; upon which he became highly excited ; so much so that a miracle was wrought upon the spot . snatching the cup from my hands , he shouted out , “ ah , karhowree sabbee lee-lee ena arva tee maitai ! ” in other words , what a blockhead of a white man ! this is the real stuff !
melville	omoo	we could not have been more startled had a frog leaped from his mouth . for an instant , he looked confused enough himself ; and then placing a finger mysteriously upon his mouth , he contrived to make us understand that at times he was subject to a suspension of the powers of speech .
melville	omoo	deeming the phenomenon a remarkable one , every way , the doctor desired him to open his mouth so that he might have a look down . but he refused . this occurrence made us rather suspicious of our host ; nor could we afterward account for his conduct , except by supposing that his feigning dumbness might in some way or other assist him in the nefarious pursuits in which it afterwards turned out that he was engaged . this conclusion , however , was not altogether satisfactory .
melville	omoo	to oblige him , we at last took a sip of his “ arva tee , ” and found it very crude , and strong as lucifer . curious to know whence it was obtained , we questioned him ; when , lighting up with pleasure , he seized the taper , and led us outside the hut , bidding us follow .
melville	omoo	after going some distance through the woods , we came to a dismantled old shed of boughs , apparently abandoned to decay . underneath , nothing was to be seen but heaps of decaying leaves and an immense , clumsy jar , wide-mouthed , and by some means , rudely hollowed out from a ponderous stone .
melville	omoo	here , for a while , we were left to ourselves ; the old man placing the light in the jar , and then disappearing . he returned , carrying a long , large bamboo , and a crotched stick . throwing these down , he poked under a pile of rubbish , and brought out a rough block of wood , pierced through and through with a hole , which was immediately clapped on the top of the jar . then planting the crotched stick upright about two yards distant , and making it sustain one end of the bamboo , he inserted the other end of the latter into the hole in the block : concluding these arrangements by placing an old calabash under the farther end of the bamboo .
melville	omoo	coming up to us now with a sly , significant look , and pointing admiringly at his apparatus , he exclaimed , “ ah , karhowree , ena hannahanna arva tee ! ” as much as to say , “ this , you see , is the way it ’ s done . ”
melville	omoo	his contrivance was nothing less than a native still , where he manufactured his island “ poteen. ” the disarray in which we found it was probably intentional , as a security against detection . before we left the shed , the old fellow toppled the whole concern over , and dragged it away piecemeal .
melville	omoo	his disclosing his secret to us thus was characteristic of the “ tootai owrees , ” or contemners of the missionaries among the natives ; who , presuming that all foreigners are opposed to the ascendancy of the missionaries , take pleasure in making them confidants , whenever the enactments of their rulers are secretly set at nought .
melville	omoo	the substance from which the liquor is produced is called “ tee , ” which is a large , fibrous root , something like yam , but smaller . in its green state , it is exceedingly acrid ; but boiled or baked , has the sweetness of the sugar-cane . after being subjected to the fire , macerated and reduced to a certain stage of fermentation , the “ tee ” is stirred up with water , and is then ready for distillation .
melville	omoo	on returning to the hut , pipes were introduced ; and , after a while , long ghost , who , at first , had relished the “ arva tee ” as little as myself , to my surprise , began to wax sociable over it , with varvy ; and , before long , absolutely got mellow , the old toper keeping him company .
melville	omoo	it was a curious sight . everyone knows that , so long as the occasion lasts , there is no stronger bond of sympathy and good feeling among men than getting tipsy together . and how earnestly , nay , movingly , a brace of worthies , thus employed , will endeavour to shed light upon , and elucidate their mystical ideas !
melville	omoo	fancy varvy and the doctor , then , lovingly tippling , and brimming over with a desire to become better acquainted ; the doctor politely bent upon carrying on the conversation in the language of his host , and the old hermit persisting in trying to talk english . the result was that , between the two , they made such a fricassee of vowels and consonants that it was enough to turn one ’ s brain .
melville	omoo	the next morning , on waking , i heard a voice from the tombs . it was the doctor solemnly pronouncing himself a dead man . he was sitting up , with both hands clasped over his forehead , and his pale face a thousand times paler than ever .
melville	omoo	“ that infernal stuff has murdered me ! ” he cried . “ heavens ! my head ’ s all wheels and springs , like the automaton chess-player ! what ’ s to be done , paul ? i ’ m poisoned. ” but , after drinking a herbal draught concocted by our host , and eating a light meal , at noon , he felt much better ; so much so that he declared himself ready to continue our journey .
melville	omoo	when we came to start , the yankee ’ s boots were missing ; and , after a diligent search , were not to be found . enraged beyond measure , their proprietor said that varvy must have stolen them ; but , considering his hospitality , i thought this extremely improbable ; though to whom else to impute the theft i knew not . the doctor maintained , however , that one who was capable of drugging an innocent traveller with “ arva tee ” was capable of anything .
melville	omoo	but it was in vain that he stormed , and varvy and i searched ; the boots were gone . were it not for this mysterious occurrence , and varvy ’ s detestable liquors , i would here recommend all travellers going round by the beach to partoowye to stop at the rock , and patronize the old gentleman—the more especially as he entertains gratis .
melville	omoo	chapter lxxiii . our reception in partoowye upon starting , at last , i flung away my sandals—by this time quite worn out—with the view of keeping company with the doctor , now forced to go barefooted . recovering his spirits in good time , he protested that boots were a bore after all , and going without them decidedly manly .
melville	omoo	this was said , be it observed , while strolling along over a soft carpet of grass ; a little moist , even at midday , from the shade of the wood through which we were passing .
melville	omoo	emerging from this we entered upon a blank , sandy tract , upon which the sun ’ s rays fairly flashed ; making the loose gravel under foot well nigh as hot as the floor of an oven . such yelling and leaping as there was in getting over this ground would be hard to surpass . we could not have crossed at all—until toward sunset—had it not been for a few small , wiry bushes growing here and there , into which we every now and then thrust our feet to cool . there was no little judgment necessary in selecting your bush ; for if not chosen judiciously , the chances were that , on springing forward again , and finding the next bush so far off that an intermediate cooling was indispensable , you would have to run back to your old place again .
melville	omoo	safely passing the sahara , or fiery desert , we soothed our half-blistered feet by a pleasant walk through a meadow of long grass , which soon brought us in sight of a few straggling houses , sheltered by a grove on the outskirts of the village of partoowye .
melville	omoo	my comrade was for entering the first one we came to ; but , on drawing near , they had so much of an air of pretension , at least for native dwellings , that i hesitated ; thinking they might be the residences of the higher chiefs , from whom no very extravagant welcome was to be anticipated .
melville	omoo	while standing irresolute , a voice from the nearest house hailed us : “ aramai ! aramai , karhowree ! ” ( come in ! come in , strangers ! ) we at once entered , and were warmly greeted . the master of the house was an aristocratic-looking islander , dressed in loose linen drawers , a fine white shirt , and a sash of red silk tied about the waist , after the fashion of the spaniards in chili . he came up to us with a free , frank air , and , striking his chest with his hand , introduced himself as ereemear po-po ; or , to render the christian name back again into english—jeremiah po-po .
melville	omoo	these curious combinations of names among the people of the society islands originate in the following way . when a native is baptized , his patronymic often gives offence to the missionaries , and they insist upon changing to something else whatever is objectionable therein . so , when jeremiah came to the font , and gave his name as narmo-nana po-po ( something equivalent to the-darer-of-devils-by-night ) , the reverend gentleman officiating told him that such a heathenish appellation would never do , and a substitute must be had ; at least for the devil part of it . some highly respectable christian appellations were then submitted , from which the candidate for admission into the church was at liberty to choose . there was adamo ( adam ) , nooar ( noah ) , daveedar ( david ) , earcobar ( james ) , eorna ( john ) , patoora ( peter ) , ereemear ( jeremiah ) , etc . and thus did he come to be named jeremiah po-po ; or , jeremiah-in-the-dark—which he certainly was , i fancy , as to the ridiculousness of his new cognomen .
melville	omoo	we gave our names in return ; upon which he bade us be seated ; and , sitting down himself , asked us a great many questions , in mixed english and tahitian . after giving some directions to an old man to prepare food , our host ’ s wife , a large , benevolent-looking woman , upwards of forty , also sat down by us . in our soiled and travel-stained appearance , the good lady seemed to find abundant matter for commiseration ; and all the while kept looking at us piteously , and making mournful exclamations .
melville	omoo	but jeremiah and his spouse were not the only inmates of the mansion . in one corner , upon a large native couch , elevated upon posts , reclined a nymph ; who , half-veiled in her own long hair , had yet to make her toilet for the day . she was the daughter of po-po ; and a very beautiful little daughter she was ; not more than fourteen ; with the most delightful shape—like a bud just blown ; and large hazel eyes . they called her loo ; a name rather pretty and genteel , and therefore quite appropriate ; for a more genteel and lady-like little damsel there was not in all imeeo .
melville	omoo	she was a cold and haughty young beauty though , this same little loo , and never deigned to notice us ; further than now and then to let her eyes float over our persons , with an expression of indolent indifference . with the tears of the loohooloo girls hardly dry from their sobbing upon our shoulders , this contemptuous treatment stung us not a little .
melville	omoo	when we first entered , po-po was raking smooth the carpet of dried ferns which had that morning been newly laid ; and now that our meal was ready , it was spread on a banana leaf , right upon this fragrant floor . here we lounged at our ease , eating baked pig and breadfruit off earthen plates , and using , for the first time in many a long month , real knives and forks .
melville	omoo	these , as well as other symptoms of refinement , somewhat abated our surprise at the reserve of the little loo ; her parents , doubtless , were magnates in partoowye , and she herself was an heiress .
melville	omoo	after being informed of our stay in the vale of martair , they were very curious to know on what errand we came to taloo . we merely hinted that the ship lying in the harbour was the reason of our coming .
melville	omoo	arfretee , po-po ’ s wife , was a right motherly body . the meal over , she recommended a nap ; and upon our waking much refreshed , she led us to the doorway , and pointed down among the trees ; through which we saw the gleam of water . taking the hint , we repaired thither ; and finding a deep shaded pool , bathed , and returned to the house . our hostess now sat down by us ; and after looking with great interest at the doctor ’ s cloak , felt of my own soiled and tattered garments for the hundredth time , and exclaimed plaintively— “ ah nuee nuee olee manee ! olee manee ! ” ( alas ! they are very , very old ! very old ! )
melville	omoo	when arfretee , good soul , thus addressed us , she thought she was talking very respectable english . the word “ nuee ” is so familiar to foreigners throughout polynesia , and is so often used by them in their intercourse with the natives , that the latter suppose it to be common to all mankind . “ olee manee ” is the native pronunciation of “ old man , ” which , by society islanders talking saxon , is applied indiscriminately to all aged things and persons whatsoever .
melville	omoo	going to a chest filled with various european articles , she took out two suits of new sailor frocks and trousers ; and presenting them with a gracious smile , pushed us behind a calico screen , and left us . without any fastidious scruples , we donned the garments ; and what with the meal , the nap , and the bath , we now came forth like a couple of bridegrooms .
melville	omoo	evening drawing on , lamps were lighted . they were very simple ; the half of a green melon , about one third full of cocoa-nut oil , and a wick of twisted tappa floating on the surface . as a night lamp , this contrivance can not be excelled ; a soft dreamy light being shed through the transparent rind .
melville	omoo	as the evening advanced , other members of the household , whom as yet we had not seen , began to drop in . there was a slender young dandy in a gay striped shirt , and whole fathoms of bright figured calico tucked about his waist , and falling to the ground . he wore a new straw hat also with three distinct ribbons tied about the crown ; one black , one green , and one pink . shoes or stockings , however , he had none .
melville	omoo	there were a couple of delicate , olive-cheeked little girls—twins—with mild eyes and beautiful hair , who ran about the house , half-naked , like a couple of gazelles . they had a brother , somewhat younger—a fine dark boy , with an eye like a woman ’ s . all these were the children of po-po , begotten in lawful wedlock .
melville	omoo	then there were two or three queer-looking old ladies , who wore shabby mantles of soiled sheeting , which fitted so badly , and withal had such a second-hand look that i at once put their wearers down as domestic paupers—poor relations , supported by the bounty of my lady arfretee . they were sad , meek old bodies ; said little and ate less ; and either kept their eyes on the ground , or lifted them up deferentially . the semi-civilization of the island must have had something to do with making them what they were .
melville	omoo	i had almost forgotten monee , the grinning old man who prepared our meal . his head was a shining , bald globe . he had a round little paunch , and legs like a cat . he was po-po ’ s factotum—cook , butler , and climber of the bread-fruit and cocoa-nut trees ; and , added to all else , a mighty favourite with his mistress ; with whom he would sit smoking and gossiping by the hour .
melville	omoo	often you saw the indefatigable monee working away at a great rate ; then dropping his employment all at once—never mind what—run off to a little distance , and after rolling himself away in a corner and taking a nap , jump up again , and fall to with fresh vigour .
melville	omoo	from a certain something in the behaviour of po-po and his household , i was led to believe that he was a pillar of the church ; though , from what i had seen in tahiti , i could hardly reconcile such a supposition with his frank , cordial , unembarrassed air . but i was not wrong in my conjecture : po-po turned out to be a sort of elder , or deacon ; he was also accounted a man of wealth , and was nearly related to a high chief .
melville	omoo	before retiring , the entire household gathered upon the floor ; and in their midst , he read aloud a chapter from a tahitian bible . then kneeling with the rest of us , he offered up a prayer . upon its conclusion , all separated without speaking . these devotions took place regularly , every night and morning . grace too was invariably said , by this family , both before and after eating .
melville	omoo	after becoming familiarized with the almost utter destitution of anything like practical piety upon these islands , what i observed in our host ’ s house astonished me much . but whatever others might have been , po-po was , in truth , a christian : the only one , arfretee excepted , whom i personally knew to be such , among all the natives of polynesia .
melville	omoo	chapter lxxiv . retiring for the night—the doctor grows devout they put us to bed very pleasantly . lying across the foot of po-po ’ s nuptial couch was a smaller one made of koar-wood ; a thin , strong cord , twisted from the fibres of the husk of the cocoa-nut , and woven into an exceedingly light sort of network , forming its elastic body . spread upon this was a single , fine mat , with a roll of dried ferns for a pillow , and a strip of white tappa for a sheet . this couch was mine . the doctor was provided for in another corner .
melville	omoo	loo reposed alone on a little settee with a taper burning by her side ; the dandy , her brother , swinging overhead in a sailor ’ s hammock the two gazelles frisked upon a mat near by ; and the indigent relations borrowed a scant corner of the old butler ’ s pallet , who snored away by the open door . after all had retired , po-po placed the illuminated melon in the middle of the apartment ; and so , we all slumbered till morning .
melville	omoo	upon awaking , the sun was streaming brightly through the open bamboos , but no one was stirring . after surveying the fine attitudes into which forgetfulness had thrown at least one of the sleepers , my attention was called off to the general aspect of the dwelling , which was quite significant of the superior circumstances of our host .
melville	omoo	the house itself was built in the simple , but tasteful native style . it was a long , regular oval , some fifty feet in length , with low sides of cane-work , and a roof thatched with palmetto-leaves . the ridgepole was , perhaps , twenty feet from the ground . there was no foundation whatever ; the bare earth being merely covered with ferns ; a kind of carpeting which serves very well , if frequently renewed ; otherwise , it becomes dusty , and the haunt of vermin , as in the huts of the poorer natives .
melville	omoo	besides the couches , the furniture consisted of three or four sailor chests ; in which were stored the fine wearing-apparel of the household—the ruffled linen shirts of po-po , the calico dresses of his wife and children , and divers odds and ends of european articles—strings of beads , ribbons , dutch looking-glasses , knives , coarse prints , bunches of keys , bits of crockery , and metal buttons . one of these chests—used as a bandbox by arfretee—contained several of the native hats ( coal-scuttles ) , all of the same pattern , but trimmed with variously-coloured ribbons . of nothing was our good hostess more proud than of these hats , and her dresses . on sundays , she went abroad a dozen times ; and every time , like queen elizabeth , in a different robe .
melville	omoo	po-po , for some reason or other , always gave us our meals before the rest of the family were served ; and the doctor , who was very discerning in such matters , declared that we fared much better than they . certain it was that , had ereemear ’ s guests travelled with purses , portmanteau , and letters of introduction to the queen , they could not have been better cared for .
melville	omoo	the day after our arrival , monee , the old butler , brought us in for dinner a small pig , baked in the ground . all savoury , it lay in a wooden trencher , surrounded by roasted hemispheres of the breadfruit . a large calabash , filled with taro pudding , or poee , followed ; and the young dandy , overcoming his customary languor , threw down our cocoa-nuts from an adjoining tree .
melville	omoo	when all was ready , and the household looking on , long ghost , devoutly clasping his hands over the fated pig , implored a blessing . hereupon , everybody present looked exceedingly pleased ; po-po coming up and addressing the doctor with much warmth ; and arfretee , regarding him with almost maternal affection , exclaimed delightedly , “ ah ! mickonaree tata matai ! ” in other words , “ what a pious young man ! ”
melville	omoo	it was just after this meal that she brought me a roll of grass sinnate ( of the kind which sailors sew into the frame of their tarpaulins ) , and then , handing me needle and thread , bade me begin at once , and make myself the hat which i so much needed . an accomplished hand at the business , i finished it that day—merely stitching the braid together ; and arfretee , by way of rewarding my industry , with her own olive hands ornamented the crown with a band of flame-coloured ribbon ; the two long ends of which streaming behind , sailor-fashion , still preserved for me the eastern title bestowed by long ghost .
melville	omoo	chapter lxxv . a ramble through the settlement the following morning , making our toilets carefully , we donned our sombreros , and sallied out on a tour . without meaning to reveal our designs upon the court , our principal object was , to learn what chances there were for white men to obtain employment under the queen . on this head , it is true , we had questioned po-po ; but his answers had been very discouraging ; so we determined to obtain further information elsewhere .
melville	omoo	but , first , to give some little description of the village . the settlement of partoowye is nothing more than some eighty houses , scattered here and there , in the midst of an immense grove , where the trees have been thinned out and the underbrush cleared away . through the grove flows a stream ; and the principal avenue crosses it , over an elastic bridge of cocoa-nut trunks , laid together side by side . the avenue is broad , and serpentine ; well shaded from one end to the other , and as pretty a place for a morning promenade as any lounger could wish . the houses , constructed without the slightest regard to the road , peep into view from among the trees on either side : some looking you right in the face as you pass , and others , without any manners , turning their backs . occasionally you observe a rural retreat , inclosed by a picket of bamboos , or with a solitary pane of glass massively framed in the broadside of the dwelling , or with a rude , strange-looking door , swinging upon dislocated wooden hinges . otherwise , the dwellings are built in the original style of the natives ; and never mind how mean and filthy some of them may appear within , they all look picturesque enough without .
melville	omoo	as we sauntered along the people we met saluted us pleasantly , and invited us into their houses ; and in this way we made a good many brief morning calls . but the hour could not have been the fashionable one in partoowye , since the ladies were invariably in dishabille . but they always gave us a cordial reception , and were particularly polite to the doctor ; caressing him , and amorously hanging about his neck ; wonderfully taken up , in short , with a gay handkerchief he wore there . arfretee had that morning bestowed it upon the pious youth .
melville	omoo	with some exceptions , the general appearance of the natives of partoowye was far better than that of the inhabitants of papeetee : a circumstance only to be imputed to their restricted intercourse with foreigners .
melville	omoo	strolling on , we turned a sweep of the road , when the doctor gave a start ; and no wonder . right before us , in the grove , was a block of houses : regular square frames , boarded over , furnished with windows and doorways , and two stories high . we ran up and found them fast going to decay : very dingy , and here and there covered with moss ; no sashes , no doors ; and on one side , the entire block had settled down nearly a foot . on going into the basement we looked clean up through the unbearded timbers to the roof ; where rays of light , glimmering through many a chink , illuminated the cobwebs which swung all round .
melville	omoo	the whole interior was dark and close . burrowing among some old mats in one corner , like a parcel of gipsies in a ruin , were a few vagabond natives . they had their dwelling here .
melville	omoo	curious to know who on earth could have been thus trying to improve the value of real estate in partoowye , we made inquiries ; and learned that some years previous the block had been thrown up by a veritable yankee ( one might have known that ) , a house-carpenter by trade , and a bold , enterprising fellow by nature .
melville	omoo	put ashore from his ship , sick , he first went to work and got well ; then sallied out with chisel and plane , and made himself generally useful . a sober , steady man , it seems , he at last obtained the confidence of several chiefs , and soon filled them with all sorts of ideas concerning the alarming want of public spirit in the people of imeeo . more especially did he dwell upon the humiliating fact of their living in paltry huts of bamboo , when magnificent palaces of boards might so easily be mortised together .
melville	omoo	in the end , these representations so far prevailed with one old chief that the carpenter was engaged to build a batch of these wonderful palaces . provided with plenty of men , he at once set to work : built a saw-mill among the mountains , felled trees , and sent over to papeetee for nails .
melville	omoo	presto ! the castle rose ; but alas , the roof was hardly on , when the yankee ’ s patron , having speculated beyond his means , broke all to pieces , and was absolutely unable to pay one “ plug ” of tobacco in the pound . his failure involved the carpenter , who sailed away from his creditors in the very next ship that touched at the harbour .
melville	omoo	the natives despised the rickety palace of boards ; and often lounged by , wagging their heads , and jeering . we were told that the queen ’ s residence was at the extreme end of the village ; so , without waiting for the doctor to procure a fiddle , we suddenly resolved upon going thither at once , and learning whether any privy counsellorships were vacant .
melville	omoo	now , although there was a good deal of my waggish comrade ’ s nonsense about what has been said concerning our expectations of court preferment , we , nevertheless , really thought that something to our advantage might turn up in that quarter .
melville	omoo	on approaching the palace grounds , we found them rather peculiar . a broad pier of hewn coral rocks was built right out into the water ; and upon this , and extending into a grove adjoining , were some eight or ten very large native houses , constructed in the handsomest style and inclosed together by a low picket of bamboos , which embraced a considerable area .
melville	omoo	throughout the society islands , the residences of the chiefs are mostly found in the immediate vicinity of the sea ; a site which gives them the full benefit of a cooling breeze ; nor are they so liable to the annoyance of insects ; besides enjoying , when they please , the fine shade afforded by the neighbouring groves , always most luxuriant near the water .
melville	omoo	lounging about the grounds were some sixty or eighty handsomely-dressed natives , men and women ; some reclining on the shady side of the houses , others under the trees , and a small group conversing close by the railing facing us .
melville	omoo	we went up to the latter ; and giving the usual salutation , were on the point of vaulting over the bamboos , when they turned upon us angrily , and said we could not enter . we stated our earnest desire to see the queen ; hinting that we were bearers of important dispatches . but it was to no purpose ; and not a little vexed , we were obliged to return to po-po ’ s without effecting anything .
melville	omoo	chapter lxxvi . an island jilt—we visit the ship upon arriving home we fully laid open to po-po our motives in visiting taloo , and begged his friendly advice . in his broken english he cheerfully gave us all the information we needed .
melville	omoo	it was true , he said , that the queen entertained some idea of making a stand against the french ; and it was currently reported also that several chiefs from borabora , huwyenee , raiatair , and tahar , the leeward islands of the group , were at that very time taking counsel with her as to the expediency of organizing a general movement throughout the entire cluster , with a view of anticipating any further encroachments on the part of the invaders . should warlike measures be actually decided upon , it was quite certain that pomaree would be glad to enlist all the foreigners she could ; but as to her making officers of either the doctor or me , that was out of the question ; because , already , a number of europeans , well known to her , had volunteered as such . concerning our getting immediate access to the queen , po-po told us it was rather doubtful ; she living at that time very retired , in poor health , and spirits , and averse to receiving calls . previous to her misfortunes , however , no one , however humble , was denied admittance to her presence ; sailors , even , attended her levees .
melville	omoo	not at all disheartened by these things , we concluded to kill time in partoowye until some event turned up more favourable to our projects . so that very day we sallied out on an excursion to the ship which , lying land-locked far up the bay , yet remained to be visited .
melville	omoo	passing on our route a long , low shed , a voice hailed us— “ white men ahoy ! ” turning round , who should we see but a rosy-cheeked englishman ( you could tell his country at a glance ) , up to his knees in shavings , and planing away at a bench . he turned out to be a runaway ship ’ s carpenter , recently from tahiti , and now doing a profitable business in imeeo , by fitting up the dwellings of opulent chiefs with cupboards and other conveniences , and once in a while trying his hand at a lady ’ s work-box . he had been in the settlement but a few months , and already possessed houses and lands .
melville	omoo	but though blessed with prosperity and high health , there was one thing wanting—a wife . and when he came to speak of the matter , his countenance fell , and he leaned dejectedly upon his plane .
melville	omoo	“ it ’ s too bad ! ” he sighed , “ to wait three long years ; and all the while , dear little lullee living in the same house with that infernal chief from tahar ! ” our curiosity was piqued ; the poor carpenter , then , had been falling in love with some island coquette , who was going to jilt him .
melville	omoo	but such was not the case . there was a law prohibiting , under a heavy penalty , the marriage of a native with a foreigner , unless the latter , after being three years a resident on the island , was willing to affirm his settled intention of remaining for life .
melville	omoo	william was therefore in a sad way . he told us that he might have married the girl half-a-dozen times , had it not been for this odious law : but , latterly , she had become less loving and more giddy , particularly with the strangers from tahar . desperately smitten , and desirous of securing her at all hazards , he had proposed to the damsel ’ s friends a nice little arrangement , introductory to marriage ; but they would not hear of it ; besides , if the pair were discovered living together upon such a footing , they would be liable to a degrading punishment : —sent to work making stone walls and opening roads for the queen .
melville	omoo	doctor long ghost was all sympathy . “ bill , my good fellow , ” said he , tremulously , “ let me go and talk to her. ” but bill , declining the offer , would not even inform us where his charmer lived .
melville	omoo	leaving the disconsolate willie planing a plank of new zealand pine ( an importation from the bay of islands ) , and thinking the while of lullee , we went on our way . how his suit prospered in the end we never learned .
melville	omoo	going from po-po ’ s house toward the anchorage of the harbour of taloo , you catch no glimpse of the water until , coming out from deep groves , you all at once find yourself upon the beach . a bay , considered by many voyagers the most beautiful in the south seas , then lies before you . you stand upon one side of what seems a deep green river , flowing through mountain passes to the sea . right opposite a majestic promontory divides the inlet from another , called after its discoverer , captain cook . the face of this promontory toward taloo is one verdant wall ; and at its base the waters lie still and fathomless . on the left hand , you just catch a peep of the widening mouth of the bay , the break in the reef by which ships enter , and , beyond , the sea . to the right , the inlet , sweeping boldly round the promontory , runs far away into the land ; where , save in one direction , the hills close in on every side , knee-deep in verdure and shooting aloft in grotesque peaks . the open space lies at the head of the bay ; in the distance it extends into a broad hazy plain lying at the foot of an amphitheatre of hills . here is the large sugar plantation previously alluded to . beyond the first range of hills , you descry the sharp pinnacles of the interior ; and among these , the same silent marling-spike which we so often admired from the other side of the island .
melville	omoo	all alone in the harbour lay the good ship leviathan . we jumped into the canoe , and paddled off to her . though early in the afternoon , everything was quiet ; but upon mounting the side we found four or five sailors lounging about the forecastle , under an awning . they gave us no very cordial reception ; and though otherwise quite hearty in appearance , seemed to assume a look of ill-humour on purpose to honour our arrival . there was much eagerness to learn whether we wanted to “ ship ” ; and by the unpleasant accounts they gave of the vessel , they seemed desirous to prevent such a thing if possible .
melville	omoo	we asked where the rest of the ship ’ s company were ; a gruff old fellow made answer , “ one boat ’ s crew of ’ em is gone to davy jones ’ s locker : —went off after a whale , last cruise , and never come back agin . all the starboard watch ran away last night , and the skipper ’ s ashore kitching ’ em . ”
melville	omoo	“ and it ’ s shipping yer after , my jewels , is it ? ” cried a curly-pated little belfast sailor , coming up to us , “ thin arrah ! my livelies , jist be after sailing ashore in a jiffy : —the divil of a skipper will carry yees both to sea , whether or no . be off wid ye thin , darlints , and steer clear of the likes of this ballyhoo of blazes as long as ye live . they murther us here every day , and starve us into the bargain . here , dick , lad , har ! the poor divil ’ s canow alongside ; and paddle away wid yees for dear life . ”
melville	omoo	but we loitered awhile , listening to more inducements to ship ; and at last concluded to stay to supper . my sheath-knife never cut into better sea-beef than that which we found lying in the kid in the forecastle . the bread , too , was hard , dry , and brittle as glass ; and there was plenty of both .
melville	omoo	while we were below , the mate of the vessel called out for someone to come on deck . i liked his voice . hearing it was as good as a look at his face . it betokened a true sailor , and no taskmaster .
melville	omoo	the appearance of the leviathan herself was quite pleasing . like all large , comfortable old whalers , she had a sort of motherly look : —broad in the beam , flush decks , and four chubby boats hanging at the breast . her sails were furled loosely upon the yards , as if they had been worn long , and fitted easy ; her shrouds swung negligently slack ; and as for the “ running rigging , ” it never worked hard as it does in some of your “ dandy ships , ” jamming in the sheaves of blocks , like chinese slippers , too small to be useful : on the contrary , the ropes ran glibly through , as if they had many a time travelled the same road , and were used to it .
melville	omoo	when evening came , we dropped into our canoe , and paddled ashore ; fully convinced that the good ship never deserved the name which they gave her . chapter lxxvii . a party of rovers—little loo and the doctor
melville	omoo	while in partoowye , we fell in with a band of six veteran rovers , prowling about the village and harbour , who had just come overland from another part of the island .
melville	omoo	a few weeks previous , they had been paid off , at papeetee , from a whaling vessel , on board of which they had , six months before , shipped for a single cruise ; that is to say , to be discharged at the next port . their cruise was a famous one ; and each man stepped upon the beach at tahiti jingling his dollars in a sock .
melville	omoo	weary at last of the shore , and having some money left , they clubbed , and purchased a sail-boat ; proposing a visit to a certain uninhabited island , concerning which they had heard strange and golden stories . of course , they never could think of going to sea without a medicine-chest filled with flasks of spirits , and a small cask of the same in the hold in case the chest should give out .
melville	omoo	away they sailed ; hoisted a flag of their own , and gave three times three , as they staggered out of the bay of papeetee with a strong breeze , and under all the “ muslin ” they could carry .
melville	omoo	evening coming on , and feeling in high spirits and no ways disposed to sleep , they concluded to make a night of it ; which they did ; all hands getting tipsy , and the two masts going over the side about midnight , to the tune of
melville	omoo	“ sailing down , sailing down , on the coast of barbaree. ” fortunately , one worthy could stand by holding on to the tiller ; and the rest managed to crawl about , and hack away the lanyards of the rigging , so as to break clear from the fallen spars . while thus employed , two sailors got tranquilly over the side , and went plumb to the bottom , under the erroneous impression that they were stepping upon an imaginary wharf to get at their work better .
melville	omoo	after this , it blew quite a gale ; and the commodore , at the helm , instinctively kept the boat before the wind ; and by so doing , ran over for the opposite island of imeeo . crossing the channel , by almost a miracle they went straight through an opening in the reef , and shot upon a ledge of coral , where the waters were tolerably smooth . here they lay until morning , when the natives came off to them in their canoes . by the help of the islanders , the schooner was hove over on her beam-ends ; when , finding the bottom knocked to pieces , the adventurers sold the boat for a trifle to the chief of the district , and went ashore , rolling before them their precious cask of spirits . its contents soon evaporated , and they came to partoowye .
melville	omoo	the day after encountering these fellows , we were strolling among the groves in the neighbourhood , when we came across several parties of natives armed with clumsy muskets , rusty cutlasses , and outlandish clubs . they were beating the bushes , shouting aloud , and apparently trying to scare somebody . they were in pursuit of the strangers , who , having in a single night set at nought all the laws of the place , had thought best to decamp .
melville	omoo	in the daytime , po-po ’ s house was as pleasant a lounge as one could wish . so , after strolling about , and seeing all there was to be seen , we spent the greater part of our mornings there ; breakfasting late , and dining about two hours after noon . sometimes we lounged on the floor of ferns , smoking , and telling stories ; of which the doctor had as many as a half-pay captain in the army . sometimes we chatted , as well as we could , with the natives ; and , one day—joy to us ! —po-po brought in three volumes of smollett ’ s novels , which had been found in the chest of a sailor , who some time previous had died on the island .
melville	omoo	amelia ! —peregrine ! —you hero of rogues , count fathom ! —what a debt do we owe you ! i know not whether it was the reading of these romances , or the want of some sentimental pastime , which led the doctor , about this period , to lay siege to the heart of the little loo .
melville	omoo	now , as i have said before , the daughter of po-po was most cruelly reserved , and never deigned to notice us . frequently i addressed her with a long face and an air of the profoundest and most distant respect—but in vain ; she wouldn ’ t even turn up her pretty olive nose . ah ! it ’ s quite plain , thought i ; she knows very well what graceless dogs sailors are , and won ’ t have anything to do with us .
melville	omoo	but thus thought not my comrade . bent he was upon firing the cold glitter of loo ’ s passionless eyes . he opened the campaign with admirable tact : making cautious approaches , and content , for three days , with ogling the nymph for about five minutes after every meal . on the fourth day , he asked her a question ; on the fifth , she dropped a nut of ointment , and he picked it up and gave it to her ; on the sixth , he went over and sat down within three yards of the couch where she lay ; and , on the memorable morn of the seventh , he proceeded to open his batteries in form .
melville	omoo	the damsel was reclining on the ferns ; one hand supporting her cheek , and the other listlessly turning over the leaves of a tahitian bible . the doctor approached . now the chief disadvantage under which he laboured was his almost complete ignorance of the love vocabulary of the island . but french counts , they say , make love delightfully in broken english ; and what hindered the doctor from doing the same in dulcet tahitian . so at it he went .
melville	omoo	“ ah ! ” said he , smiling bewitchingly , “ oee mickonaree ; oee ready biblee ? ” no answer ; not even a look . “ ah i matai ! very goody ready biblee mickonaree. ” loo , without stirring , began reading , in a low tone , to herself .
melville	omoo	“ mickonaree biblee ready goody maitai , ” once more observed the doctor , ingeniously transposing his words for the third time . but all to no purpose ; loo gave no sign . he paused , despairingly ; but it would never do to give up ; so he threw himself at full length beside her , and audaciously commenced turning over the leaves .
melville	omoo	loo gave a start , just one little start , barely perceptible , and then , fumbling something in her hand , lay perfectly motionless ; the doctor rather frightened at his own temerity , and knowing not what to do next . at last , he placed one arm cautiously about her waist ; almost in the same instant he bounded to his feet , with a cry ; the little witch had pierced him with a thorn . but there she lay , just as quietly as ever , turning over the leaves , and reading to herself .
melville	omoo	my long friend raised the siege incontinently , and made a disorderly retreat to the place where i reclined , looking on . i am pretty sure that loo must have related this occurrence to her father , who came in shortly afterward ; for he looked queerly at the doctor . but he said nothing ; and , in ten minutes , was quite as affable as ever . as for loo , there was not the slightest change in her ; and the doctor , of course , for ever afterwards held his peace .
melville	omoo	chapter lxxviii . mrs. bell one day , taking a pensive afternoon stroll along one of the many bridle-paths which wind among the shady groves in the neighbourhood of taloo , i was startled by a sunny apparition . it was that of a beautiful young englishwoman , charmingly dressed , and mounted upon a spirited little white pony . switching a green branch , she came cantering toward me .
melville	omoo	i looked round to see whether i could possibly be in polynesia . there were the palm-trees ; but how to account for the lady ? stepping to one side as the apparition drew near , i made a polite obeisance . it gave me a bold , rosy look ; and then , with a gay air , patted its palfrey , crying out , “ fly away , willie ! ” and galloped among the trees .
melville	omoo	i would have followed ; but willie ’ s heels were making such a pattering among the dry leaves that pursuit would have been useless . so i went straight home to po-po ’ s , and related my adventure to the doctor .
melville	omoo	the next day , our inquiries resulted in finding out that the stranger had been on the island about two years ; that she came from sydney ; and was the wife of mr. bell ( happy dog ! ) , the proprietor of the sugar plantation to which i have previously referred .
melville	omoo	to the sugar plantation we went , the same day . the country round about was very beautiful : a level basin of verdure , surrounded by sloping hillsides . the sugar-cane—of which there was about one hundred acres , in various stages of cultivation—looked thrifty . a considerable tract of land , however , which seemed to have been formerly tilled , was now abandoned .
melville	omoo	the place where they extracted the saccharine matter was under an immense shed of bamboos . here we saw several clumsy pieces of machinery for breaking the cane ; also great kettles for boiling the sugar . but , at present , nothing was going on . two or three natives were lounging in one of the kettles , smoking ; the other was occupied by three sailors from the leviathan , playing cards .
melville	omoo	while we were conversing with these worthies , a stranger approached . he was a sun-burnt , romantic-looking european , dressed in a loose suit of nankeen ; his fine throat and chest were exposed , and he sported a guayaquil hat with a brim like a chinese umbrella . this was mr. bell . he was very civil ; showed us the grounds , and , taking us into a sort of arbour , to our surprise , offered to treat us to some wine . people often do the like ; but mr. bell did more : he produced the bottle . it was spicy sherry ; and we drank out of the halves of fresh citron melons . delectable goblets !
melville	omoo	the wine was a purchase from , the french in tahiti . now all this was extremely polite in mr. bell ; still , we came to see mrs. bell . but she proved to be a phantom , indeed ; having left the same morning for papeetee , on a visit to one of the missionaries ’ wives there .
melville	omoo	i went home , much chagrined . to be frank , my curiosity had been wonderfully piqued concerning the lady . in the first place , she was the most beautiful white woman i ever saw in polynesia . but this is saying nothing . she had such eyes , such moss-roses in her cheeks , such a divine air in the saddle , that , to my dying day , i shall never forget mrs. bell .
melville	omoo	the sugar-planter himself was young , robust , and handsome . so , merrily may the little bells increase , and multiply , and make music in the land of imeeo . chapter lxxix . taloo chapel—holding court in polynesia
melville	omoo	in partoowye is to be seen one of the best-constructed and handsomest chapels in the south seas . like the buildings of the palace , it stands upon an artificial pier , presenting a semicircular sweep to the bay . the chapel is built of hewn blocks of coral ; a substance which , although extremely friable , is said to harden by exposure to the atmosphere . to a stranger , these blocks look extremely curious . their surface is covered with strange fossil-like impressions , the seal of which must have been set before the flood . very nearly white when hewn from the reefs , the coral darkens with age ; so that several churches in polynesia now look almost as sooty and venerable as famed st. paul ’ s .
melville	omoo	in shape , the chapel is an octagon , with galleries all round . it will seat , perhaps , four hundred people . everything within is stained a tawny red ; and there being but few windows , or rather embrasures , the dusky benches and galleries , and the tall spectre of a pulpit look anything but cheerful .
melville	omoo	on sundays we always went to worship here . going in the family suite of po-po , we , of course , maintained a most decorous exterior ; and hence , by all the elderly people of the village , were doubtless regarded as pattern young men .
melville	omoo	po-po ’ s seat was in a snug corner ; and it being particularly snug , in the immediate vicinity of one of the palm pillars supporting the gallery , i invariably leaned against it : po-po and his lady on one side , the doctor and the dandy on the other , and the children and poor relations seated behind .
melville	omoo	as for loo , instead of sitting ( as she ought to have done ) by her good father and mother , she must needs run up into the gallery , and sit with a parcel of giddy creatures of her own age ; who , all through the sermon , did nothing but look down on the congregation ; pointing out , and giggling at the queer-looking old ladies in dowdy bonnets and scant tunics . but loo , herself , was never guilty of these improprieties .
melville	omoo	occasionally during the week they have afternoon service in the chapel , when the natives themselves have something to say ; although their auditors are but few . an introductory prayer being offered by the missionary , and a hymn sung , communicants rise in their places , and exhort in pure tahitian , and with wonderful tone and gesture . and among them all , deacon po-po , though he talked most , was the one whom you would have liked best to hear . much would i have given to have understood some of his impassioned bursts ; when he tossed his arms overhead , stamped , scowled , and glared , till he looked like the very angel of vengeance .
melville	omoo	“ deluded man ! ” sighed the doctor , on one of these occasions , “ i fear he takes the fanatical view of the subject. ” one thing was certain : when po-po spoke , all listened ; a great deal more than could be said for the rest ; for under the discipline of two or three i could mention , some of the audience napped ; others fidgeted ; a few yawned ; and one irritable old gentleman , in a nightcap of cocoa-nut leaves , used to clutch his long staff in a state of excessive nervousness , and stride out of the church , making all the noise he could , to emphasize his disgust .
melville	omoo	right adjoining the chapel is an immense , rickety building , with windows and shutters , and a half-decayed board flooring laid upon trunks of palm-trees . they called it a school-house ; but as such we never saw it occupied . it was often used as a court-room , however ; and here we attended several trials ; among others , that of a decayed naval officer , and a young girl of fourteen ; the latter charged with having been very naughty on a particular occasion set forth in the pleadings ; and the former with having aided and abetted her in her naughtiness , and with other misdemeanours .
melville	omoo	the foreigner was a tall , military-looking fellow , with a dark cheek and black whiskers . according to his own account , he had lost a colonial armed brig on the coast of new zealand ; and since then , had been leading the life of a man about town among the islands of the pacific .
melville	omoo	the doctor wanted to know why he did not go home and report the loss of his brig ; but captain crash , as they called him , had some incomprehensible reasons for not doing so , about which he could talk by the hour , and no one be any the wiser . probably he was a discreet man , and thought it best to waive an interview with the lords of the admiralty .
melville	omoo	for some time past , this extremely suspicious character had been carrying on the illicit trade in french wines and brandies , smuggled over from the men-of-war lately touching at tahiti . in a grove near the anchorage he had a rustic shanty and arbour , where , in quiet times , when no ships were in taloo , a stray native once in a while got boozy , and staggered home , catching at the cocoa-nut trees as he went . the captain himself lounged under a tree during the warm afternoons , pipe in mouth ; thinking , perhaps , over old times , and occasionally feeling his shoulders for his lost epaulets .
melville	omoo	but , sail ho ! a ship is descried coming into the bay . soon she drops her anchor in its waters ; and the next day captain crash entertains the sailors in his grove . and rare times they have of it : —drinking and quarrelling together as sociably as you please .
melville	omoo	upon one of these occasions , the crew of the leviathan made so prodigious a tumult that the natives , indignant at the insult offered their laws , plucked up a heart , and made a dash at the rioters , one hundred strong . the sailors fought like tigers ; but were at last overcome , and carried before a native tribunal ; which , after a mighty clamour , dismissed everybody but captain crash , who was asserted to be the author of the disorders .
melville	omoo	upon this charge , then , he had been placed in confinement against the coming on of the assizes ; the judge being expected to lounge along in the course of the afternoon . while waiting his honour ’ s arrival , numerous additional offences were preferred against the culprit ( mostly by the old women ) ; among others was the bit of a slip in which he stood implicated along with the young lady . thus , in polynesia as elsewhere ; —charge a man with one misdemeanour , and all his peccadilloes are raked up and assorted before him .
melville	omoo	going to the school-house for the purpose of witnessing the trial , the din of it assailed our ears a long way off ; and upon entering the building , we were almost stunned . about five hundred natives were present ; each apparently having something to say and determined to say it . his honour—a handsome , benevolent-looking old man—sat cross-legged on a little platform , seemingly resigned , with all christian submission , to the uproar . he was an hereditary chief in this quarter of the island , and judge for life in the district of partoowye .
melville	omoo	there were several cases coming on ; but the captain and girl were first tried together . they were mixing freely with the crowd ; and as it afterwards turned out that everyone—no matter who—had a right to address the court , for aught we knew they might have been arguing their own case . at what precise moment the trial began it would be hard to say . there was no swearing of witnesses , and no regular jury . now and then somebody leaped up and shouted out something which might have been evidence ; the rest , meanwhile , keeping up an incessant jabbering . presently the old judge himself began to get excited ; and springing to his feet , ran in among the crowd , wagging his tongue as hard as anybody .
melville	omoo	the tumult lasted about twenty minutes ; and toward the end of it , captain crash might have been seen , tranquilly regarding , from his honour ’ s platform , the judicial uproar , in which his fate was about being decided .
melville	omoo	the result of all this was that both he and the girl were found guilty . the latter was adjudged to make six mats for the queen ; and the former , in consideration of his manifold offences , being deemed incorrigible , was sentenced to eternal banishment from the island . both these decrees seemed to originate in the general hubbub . his honour , however , appeared to have considerable authority , and it was quite plain that the decision received his approval .
melville	omoo	the above penalties were by no means indiscriminately inflicted . the missionaries have prepared a sort of penal tariff to facilitate judicial proceedings . it costs so many days ’ labour on the broom road to indulge in the pleasures of the calabash ; so many fathoms of stone wall to steal a musket ; and so on to the end of the catalogue . the judge being provided with a book in which all these matters are cunningly arranged , the thing is vastly convenient . for instance : a crime is proved , —say bigamy ; turn to letter b—and there you have it . bigamy : —forty days on the broom road , and twenty mats for the queen . read the passage aloud , and sentence is pronounced .
melville	omoo	after taking part in the first trial , the other delinquents present were put upon their own ; in which , also , the convicted culprits seemed to have quite as much to say as the rest . a rather strange proceeding ; but strictly in accordance with the glorious english principle , that every man should be tried by his peers . they were all found guilty .

melville	omoo	every reader of cook ’ s voyages must remember “ otto , ” who , in that navigator ’ s time , was king of the larger peninsula of tahiti . subsequently , assisted by the muskets of the bounty ’ s men , he extended his rule over the entire island . this otto , before his death , had his name changed into pomaree , which has ever since been the royal patronymic .
melville	omoo	he was succeeded by his son , pomaree ii. , the most famous prince in the annals of tahiti . though a sad debauchee and drunkard , and even charged with unnatural crimes , he was a great friend of the missionaries , and one of their very first proselytes . during the religious wars into which he was hurried by his zeal for the new faith , he was defeated and expelled from the island . after a short exile he returned from imeeo , with an army of eight hundred warriors , and in the battle of narii routed the rebellious pagans with great slaughter , and reestablished himself upon the throne . thus , by force of arms , was christianity finally triumphant in tahiti .
melville	omoo	pomaree ii. , dying in 1821 , was succeeded by his infant son , under the title of pomaree iii . this young prince survived his father but six years ; and the government then descended to his elder sister , aimata , the present queen , who is commonly called pomaree vahinee i. , or the first female pomaree . her majesty must be now upwards of thirty years of age . she has been twice married . her first husband was a son of the old king of tahar , an island about one hundred miles from tahiti . this proving an unhappy alliance , the pair were soon afterwards divorced . the present husband of the queen is a chief of imeeo .
melville	omoo	the reputation of pomaree is not what it ought to be . she , and also her mother , were , for a long time , excommunicated members of the church ; and the former , i believe , still is . among other things , her conjugal fidelity is far from being unquestioned . indeed , it was upon this ground chiefly that she was excluded from the communion of the church .
melville	omoo	previous to her misfortunes she spent the greater portion of her time sailing about from one island to another , attended by a licentious court ; and wherever she went all manner of games and festivities celebrated her arrival .
melville	omoo	she was always given to display . for several years the maintenance of a regiment of household troops drew largely upon the royal exchequer . they were trouserless fellows , in a uniform of calico shirts and pasteboard hats ; armed with muskets of all shapes and calibres , and commanded by a great noisy chief , strutting it in a coat of fiery red . these heroes escorted their mistress whenever she went abroad .
melville	omoo	some time ago , the queen received from her english sister , victoria , a very showy , though uneasy , head-dress—a crown ; probably made to order at some tinman ’ s in london . having no idea of reserving so pretty a bauble for coronation days , which come so seldom , her majesty sported it whenever she appeared in public ; and , to show her familiarity with european customs , politely touched it to all foreigners of distinction—whaling captains , and the like—whom she happened to meet in her evening walk on the broom road .
melville	omoo	the arrival and departure of royalty were always announced at the palace by the court artilleryman—a fat old gentleman who , in a prodigious hurry and perspiration , discharged minute fowling-pieces as fast as he could load and fire the same .
melville	omoo	the tahitian princess leads her husband a hard life . poor fellow ! he not only caught a queen , but a tartar , when he married her . the style by which he is addressed is rather significant— “ pomaree-tanee ” ( pomaree ’ s man ) . all things considered , as appropriate a title for a king-consort as could be hit upon .
melville	omoo	if ever there were a henpecked husband , that man is the prince . one day , his carasposa giving audience to a deputation from the captains of the vessels lying in papeetee , he ventured to make a suggestion which was very displeasing to her . she turned round and , boxing his ears , told him to go over to his beggarly island of imeeo if he wanted to give himself airs .
melville	omoo	cuffed and contemned , poor tanee flies to the bottle , or rather to the calabash , for solace . like his wife and mistress , he drinks more than he ought . six or seven years ago , when an american man-of-war was lying at papeetee , the town was thrown into the greatest commotion by a conjugal assault and battery made upon the sacred person of pomaree by her intoxicated tanee .
melville	omoo	captain bob once told me the story . and by way of throwing more spirit into the description , as well as to make up for his oral deficiencies , the old man went through the accompanying action : myself being proxy for the queen of tahiti .
melville	omoo	it seems that , on a sunday morning , being dismissed contemptuously from the royal presence , tanee was accosted by certain good fellows , friends and boon companions , who condoled with him on his misfortunes—railed against the queen , and finally dragged him away to an illicit vendor of spirits , in whose house the party got gloriously mellow . in this state , pomaree vahinee i. was the topic upon which all dilated— “ a vixen of a queen , ” probably suggested one . “ it ’ s infamous , ” said another ; “ and i ’ d have satisfaction , ” cried a third . “ and so i will ! ” —tanee must have hiccoughed ; for off he went ; and ascertaining that his royal half was out riding , he mounted his horse and galloped after her .
melville	omoo	near the outskirts of the town , a cavalcade of women came cantering toward him , in the centre of which was the object of his fury . smiting his beast right and left , he dashed in among them , completely overturning one of the party , leaving her on the field , and dispersing everybody else except pomaree . backing her horse dexterously , the incensed queen heaped upon him every scandalous epithet she could think of ; until at last the enraged tanee leaped out of his saddle , caught pomaree by her dress , and dragging her to the earth struck her repeatedly in the face , holding on meanwhile by the hair of her head . he was proceeding to strangle her on the spot , when the cries of the frightened attendants brought a crowd of natives to the rescue , who bore the nearly insensible queen away .
melville	omoo	but his frantic rage was not yet sated . he ran to the palace ; and before it could be prevented , demolished a valuable supply of crockery , a recent present from abroad . in the act of perpetrating some other atrocity , he was seized from behind , and carried off with rolling eyes and foaming at the mouth .
melville	omoo	this is a fair example of a tahitian in a passion . though the mildest of mortals in general , and hard to be roused , when once fairly up , he is possessed with a thousand devils .
melville	omoo	the day following , tanee was privately paddled over to imeeo in a canoe ; where , after remaining in banishment for a couple of weeks , he was allowed to return , and once more give in his domestic adhesion .
melville	omoo	though pomaree vahinee i. be something of a jezebel in private life , in her public rule she is said to have been quite lenient and forbearing . this was her true policy ; for an hereditary hostility to her family had always lurked in the hearts of many powerful chiefs , the descendants of the old kings of taiarboo , dethroned by her grandfather otoo . chief among these , and in fact the leader of his party , was poofai ; a bold , able man , who made no secret of his enmity to the missionaries , and the government which they controlled . but while events were occurring calculated to favour the hopes of the disaffected and turbulent , the arrival of the french gave a most unexpected turn to affairs .
melville	omoo	during my sojourn in tahiti , a report was rife—which i knew to originate with what is generally called the “ missionary party ” —that poofai and some other chiefs of note had actually agreed , for a stipulated bribe , to acquiesce in the appropriation of their country . but subsequent events have rebutted the calumny . several of these very men have recently died in battle against the french .
melville	omoo	under the sovereignty of the pomarees , the great chiefs of tahiti were something like the barons of king john . holding feudal sway over their patrimonial valleys , and on account of their descent , warmly beloved by the people , they frequently cut off the royal revenues by refusing to pay the customary tribute due from them as vassals .
melville	omoo	the truth is , that with the ascendancy of the missionaries , the regal office in tahiti lost much of its dignity and influence . in the days of paganism , it was supported by all the power of a numerous priesthood , and was solemnly connected with the entire superstitious idolatry of the land . the monarch claimed to be a sort of bye-blow of tararroa , the saturn of the polynesian mythology , and cousin-german to inferior deities . his person was thrice holy ; if he entered an ordinary dwelling , never mind for how short a time , it was demolished when he left ; no common mortal being thought worthy to inhabit it afterward .
melville	omoo	“ i ’ m a greater man than king george , ” said the incorrigible young otoo to the first missionaries ; “ he rides on a horse , and i on a man. ” such was the case . he travelled post through his dominions on the shoulders of his subjects ; and relays of mortal beings were provided in all the valleys .
melville	omoo	but alas ! how times have changed ; how transient human greatness . some years since , pomaree vahinee i. , the granddaughter of the proud otoo , went into the laundry business ; publicly soliciting , by her agents , the washing of the linen belonging to the officers of ships touching in her harbours .
melville	omoo	it is a significant fact , and one worthy of record , that while the influence of the english missionaries at tahiti has tended to so great a diminution of the regal dignity there , that of the american missionaries at the sandwich islands has been purposely exerted to bring about a contrary result .
melville	omoo	chapter lxxxi . we visit the court it was about the middle of the second month of the hegira , and therefore some five weeks after our arrival in partoowye , that we at last obtained admittance to the residence of the queen .
melville	omoo	it happened thus . there was a marquesan in the train of pomaree who officiated as nurse to her children . according to the tahitian custom , the royal youngsters are carried about until it requires no small degree of strength to stand up under them . but marbonna was just the man for this—large and muscular , well made as a statue , and with an arm like a degenerate tahitian ’ s thigh .
melville	omoo	embarking at his native island as a sailor on board of a french whaler , he afterward ran away from the ship at tahiti ; where , being seen and admired by pomaree , he had been prevailed upon to enlist in her service .
melville	omoo	often , when visiting the grounds , we saw him walking about in the shade , carrying two handsome boys , who encircled his neck with their arms . marbonna ’ s face , tattooed as it was in the ornate style of his tribe , was as good as a picture-book to these young pomarees . they delighted to trace with their fingers the outlines of the strange shapes there delineated .
melville	omoo	the first time my eyes lighted upon the marquesan , i knew his country in a moment ; and hailing him in his own language , he turned round , surprised that a person so speaking should be a stranger . he proved to be a native of tior , a glen of nukuheva . i had visited the place more than once ; and so , on the island of imeeo , we met like old friends .
melville	omoo	in my frequent conversations with him over the bamboo picket , i found this islander a philosopher of nature—a wild heathen , moralizing upon the vices and follies of the christian court of tahiti—a savage , scorning the degeneracy of the people among whom fortune had thrown him .
melville	omoo	i was amazed at the national feelings of the man . no european , when abroad , could speak of his country with more pride than marbonna . he assured me , again and again , that so soon as he had obtained sufficient money to purchase twenty muskets , and as many bags of powder , he was going to return to a place with which imeeo was not worthy to be compared .
melville	omoo	it was marbonna who , after one or two unsuccessful attempts , at last brought about our admission into the queen ’ s grounds . through a considerable crowd he conducted us along the pier to where an old man was sitting , to whom he introduced us as a couple of “ karhowrees ” of his acquaintance , anxious to see the sights of the palace . the venerable chamberlain stared at us , and shook his head : the doctor , thinking he wanted a fee , placed a plug of tobacco in his hand . this was ingratiating , and we were permitted to pass on . upon the point of entering one of the houses , marbonna ’ s name was shouted in half-a-dozen different directions , and he was obliged to withdraw .
melville	omoo	thus left at the very threshold to shift for ourselves , my companion ’ s assurance stood us in good stead . he stalked right in , and i followed . the place was full of women , who , instead of exhibiting the surprise we expected , accosted us as cordially as if we had called to take our souchong with them by express invitation . in the first place , nothing would do but we must each devour a calabash of “ poee , ” and several roasted bananas . pipes were then lighted , and a brisk conversation ensued .
melville	omoo	these ladies of the court , if not very polished , were surprisingly free and easy in their manners ; quite as much so as king charles ’ s beauties . there was one of them—an arch little miss , who could converse with us pretty fluently—to whom we strove to make ourselves particularly agreeable , with the view of engaging her services as cicerone .
melville	omoo	as such , she turned out to be everything we could desire . no one disputing her will , every place was entered without ceremony , curtains brushed aside , mats lifted , and each nook and corner explored . whether the little damsel carried her mistress ’ signet , that everything opened to her thus , i know not ; but marbonna himself , the bearer of infants , could not have been half so serviceable .
melville	omoo	among other houses which we visited , was one of large size and fine exterior ; the special residence of a european—formerly the mate of a merchant vessel , —who had done himself the honour of marrying into the pomaree family . the lady he wedded being a near kinswoman of the queen , he became a permanent member of her majesty ’ s household . this adventurer rose late , dressed theatrically in calico and trinkets , assumed a dictatorial tone in conversation , and was evidently upon excellent terms with himself .
melville	omoo	we found him reclining on a mat , smoking a reed-pipe of tobacco , in the midst of an admiring circle of chiefs and ladies . he must have noticed our approach ; but instead of rising and offering civilities , he went on talking and smoking , without even condescending to look at us .
melville	omoo	“ his highness feels his ‘ poee , ’ ” carelessly observed the doctor . the rest of the company gave us the ordinary salutation , our guide announcing us beforehand . in answer to our earnest requests to see the queen , we were now conducted to an edifice , by far the most spacious , in the inclosure . it was at least one hundred and fifty feet in length , very wide , with low eaves , and an exceedingly steep roof of pandannas leaves . there were neither doors nor windows—nothing along the sides but the slight posts supporting the rafters . between these posts , curtains of fine matting and tappa were rustling , all round ; some of them were festooned , or partly withdrawn , so as to admit light and air , and afford a glimpse now and then of what was going on within .
melville	omoo	pushing aside one of the screens , we entered . the apartment was one immense hall ; the long and lofty ridge-pole fluttering with fringed matting and tassels , full forty feet from the ground . lounges of mats , piled one upon another , extended on either side : while here and there were slight screens , forming as many recesses , where groups of natives—all females—were reclining at their evening meal .
melville	omoo	as we advanced , these various parties ceased their buzzing , and in explanation of our appearance among them , listened to a few cabalistic words from our guide . the whole scene was a strange one ; but what most excited our surprise was the incongruous assemblage of the most costly objects from all quarters of the globe . cheek by jowl , they lay beside the rudest native articles , without the slightest attempt at order . superb writing-desks of rosewood , inlaid with silver and mother-of-pearl ; decanters and goblets of cut glass ; embossed volumes of plates ; gilded candelabra ; sets of globes and mathematical instruments ; the finest porcelain ; richly-mounted sabres and fowling-pieces ; laced hats and sumptuous garments of all sorts , with numerous other matters of european manufacture , were strewn about among greasy calabashes half-filled with “ poee , ” rolls of old tappa and matting , paddles and fish-spears , and the ordinary furniture of a tahitian dwelling .
melville	omoo	all the articles first mentioned were , doubtless , presents from foreign powers . they were more or less injured : the fowling-pieces and swords were rusted ; the finest woods were scratched ; and a folio volume of hogarth lay open , with a cocoa-nut shell of some musty preparation capsized among the miscellaneous furniture of the rake ’ s apartment , where that inconsiderate young gentleman is being measured for a coat .
melville	omoo	while we were amusing ourselves in this museum of curiosities , our conductor plucked us by the sleeve , and whispered , “ pomaree ! pomaree ! armai kow kow. ” “ she is coming to sup , then , ” said the doctor , staring in the direction indicated . “ what say you , paul , suppose we step up ? ” just then a curtain near by lifted , and from a private building a few yards distant the queen entered , unattended .
melville	omoo	she wore a loose gown of blue silk , with two rich shawls , one red and the other yellow , tied about her neck . her royal majesty was barefooted . she was about the ordinary size , rather matronly ; her features not very handsome ; her mouth , voluptuous ; but there was a care-worn expression in her face , probably attributable to her late misfortunes . from her appearance , one would judge her about forty ; but she is not so old .
melville	omoo	as the queen approached one of the recesses , her attendants hurried up , escorted her in , and smoothed the mats on which she at last reclined . two girls soon appeared , carrying their mistress ’ repast ; and then , surrounded by cut-glass and porcelain , and jars of sweetmeats and confections , pomaree vahinee i. , the titular queen of tahiti , ate fish and “ poee ” out of her native calabashes , disdaining either knife or spoon .
melville	omoo	“ come on , ” whispered long ghost , “ let ’ s have an audience at once ; ” and he was on the point of introducing himself , when our guide , quite alarmed , held him back and implored silence . the other natives also interfered , and , as he was pressing forward , raised such an outcry that pomaree lifted her eyes and saw us for the first .
melville	omoo	she seemed surprised and offended , and , issuing an order in a commanding tone to several of her women , waved us out of the house . summary as the dismissal was , court etiquette , no doubt , required our compliance . we withdrew ; making a profound inclination as we disappeared behind the tappa arras .
melville	omoo	we departed the ground without seeing marbonna ; and previous to vaulting over the picket , feed our pretty guide after a fashion of our own . looking round a few moments after , we saw the damsel escorted back by two men , who seemed to have been sent after her . i trust she received nothing more than a reprimand .
melville	omoo	the next day po-po informed us that strict orders had been issued to admit no strangers within the palace precincts . chapter lxxxii . which ends the book disappointed in going to court , we determined upon going to sea . it would never do , longer to trespass on po-po ’ s hospitality ; and then , weary somewhat of life in imeeo , like all sailors ashore , i at last pined for the billows .
melville	omoo	now , if her crew were to be credited , the leviathan was not the craft to our mind . but i had seen the captain , and liked him . he was an uncommonly tall , robust , fine-looking man , in the prime of life . there was a deep crimson spot in the middle of each sunburnt cheek , doubtless the effect of his sea-potations . he was a vineyarder , or native of the island of martha ’ s vineyard ( adjoining nantucket ) , and—i would have sworn it—a sailor , and no tyrant .
melville	omoo	previous to this , we had rather avoided the leviathan ’ s men , when they came ashore ; but now , we purposely threw ourselves in their way , in order to learn more of the vessel .
melville	omoo	we became acquainted with the third mate , a prussian , and an old merchant-seaman—a right jolly fellow , with a face like a ruby . we took him to po-po ’ s , and gave him a dinner of baked pig and breadfruit ; with pipes and tobacco for dessert . the account he gave us of the ship agreed with my own surmises . a cosier old craft never floated ; and the captain was the finest man in the world . there was plenty to eat , too ; and , at sea , nothing to do but sit on the windlass and sail . the only bad trait about the vessel was this : she had been launched under some baleful star ; and so was a luckless ship in the fishery . she dropped her boats into the brine often enough , and they frequently got fast to the whales ; but lance and harpoon almost invariably “ drew ” when darted by the men of the leviathan . but what of that ? we would have all the sport of chasing the monsters , with none of the detestable work which follows their capture . so , hurrah for the coast of japan ! thither the ship was bound .
melville	omoo	a word now about the hard stories we heard the first time we visited the ship . they were nothing but idle fictions , got up by the sailors for the purpose of frightening us away , so as to oblige the captain , who was in want of more hands , to lie the longer in a pleasant harbour .
melville	omoo	the next time the vineyarder came ashore , we flung ourselves in his path . when informed of our desire to sail with him , he wanted to know our history ; and , above all , what countrymen we were . we said that we had left a whaler in tahiti , some time previous ; and , since then , had been—in the most praiseworthy manner—employed upon a plantation . as for our country , sailors belong to no nation in particular ; we were , on this occasion , both yankees . upon this he looked decidedly incredulous ; and freely told us that he verily believed we were both from sydney .
melville	omoo	be it known here that american sea captains , in the pacific , are mortally afraid of these sydney gentry ; who , to tell the truth , wherever known , are in excessively bad odour . is there a mutiny on board a ship in the south seas , ten to one a sydney man is the ringleader . ashore , these fellows are equally riotous .
melville	omoo	it was on this account that we were anxious to conceal the fact of our having belonged to the julia , though it annoyed me much , thus to deny the dashing little craft . for the same reason , also , the doctor fibbed about his birthplace .
melville	omoo	unfortunately , one part of our raiment—arfretee ’ s blue frocks—we deemed a sort of collateral evidence against us . for , curiously enough , an american sailor is generally distinguished by his red frock ; and an english tar by his blue one : thus reversing the national colours . the circumstance was pointed out by the captain ; and we quickly explained the anomaly . but , in vain : he seemed inveterately prejudiced against us ; and , in particular , eyed the doctor most distrustfully .
melville	omoo	by way of propping the tatter ’ s pretensions , i was throwing out a hint concerning kentucky , as a land of tall men , when our vine-yarder turned away abruptly , and desired to hear nothing more . it was evident that he took long ghost for an exceedingly problematical character .
melville	omoo	perceiving this , i resolved to see what a private interview would do . so , one afternoon , i found the captain smoking a pipe in the dwelling of a portly old native—one mai-mai—who , for a reasonable compensation , did the honours of partoowye to illustrious strangers .
melville	omoo	his guest had just risen from a sumptuous meal of baked pig and taro pudding ; and the remnants of the repast were still visible . two reeking bottles , also , with their necks wrenched off , lay upon the mat . all this was encouraging ; for , after a good dinner , one feels affluent and amiable , and peculiarly open to conviction . so , at all events , i found the noble vineyarder .
melville	omoo	i began by saying that i called for the purpose of setting him right touching certain opinions of his concerning the place of my nativity : —i was an american—thank heaven ! —and wanted to convince him of the fact .
melville	omoo	after looking me in the eye for some time , and , by so doing , revealing an obvious unsteadiness in his own visual organs , he begged me to reach forth my arm . i did so ; wondering what upon earth that useful member had to do with the matter in hand .
melville	omoo	he placed his fingers upon my wrist ; and holding them there for a moment , sprang to his feet , and , with much enthusiasm , pronounced me a yankee , every beat of my pulse !
melville	omoo	“ here , mai-mai ! ” he cried , “ another bottle ! ” and , when it came , with one stroke of a knife , he summarily beheaded it , and commanded me to drain it to the bottom . he then told me that if i would come on board his vessel the following morning , i would find the ship ’ s articles on the cabin transom .
melville	omoo	this was getting along famously . but what was to become of the doctor ? i forthwith made an adroit allusion to my long friend . but it was worse than useless . the vineyarder swore he would have nothing to do with him—he ( my long friend ) was a “ bird ” from sydney , and nothing would make him ( the man of little faith ) believe otherwise .
melville	omoo	i could not help loving the free-hearted captain ; but indignant at this most unaccountable prejudice against my comrade , i abruptly took leave . upon informing the doctor of the result of the interview , he was greatly amused ; and laughingly declared that the vineyarder must be a penetrating fellow . he then insisted upon my going to sea in the ship , since he well knew how anxious i was to leave . as for himself , on second thoughts , he was no sailor ; and although “ lands— ’ men ” very often compose part of a whaler ’ s crew , he did not quite relish the idea of occupying a position so humble . in short , he had made up his mind to tarry awhile in imeeo .
melville	omoo	i turned the matter over : and at last decided upon quitting the island . the impulse urging me to sea once more , and the prospect of eventually reaching home , were too much to be resisted ; especially as the leviathan , so comfortable a craft , was now bound on her last whaling cruise , and , in little more than a year ’ s time , would be going round cape horn .
melville	omoo	i did not , however , covenant to remain in the vessel for the residue of the voyage ; which would have been needlessly binding myself . i merely stipulated for the coming cruise , leaving my subsequent movements unrestrained ; for there was no knowing that i might not change my mind , and prefer journeying home by short and easy stages .
melville	omoo	the next day i paddled off to the ship , signed and sealed , and stepped ashore with my “ advance ” —fifteen spanish dollars—tasseling the ends of my neck-handkerchief . i forced half of the silver on long ghost ; and having little use for the remainder , would have given it to po-po as some small return for his kindness ; but , although he well knew the value of the coin , not a dollar would he accept .
melville	omoo	in three days ’ time the prussian came to po-po ’ s , and told us that the captain , having made good the number of his crew by shipping several islanders , had determined upon sailing with the land breeze at dawn the following morning . these tidings were received in the afternoon . the doctor immediately disappeared , returning soon after with a couple of flasks of wine concealed in the folds of his frock . through the agency of the marquesan , he had purchased them from an understrapper of the court .
melville	omoo	i prevailed upon po-po to drink a parting shell ; and even little loo , actually looking conscious that one of her hopeless admirers was about leaving partoowye for ever , sipped a few drops from a folded leaf . as for the warm-hearted arfretee , her grief was unbounded . she even besought me to spend my last night under her own palm-thatch ; and then , in the morning , she would herself paddle me off to the ship .
melville	omoo	but this i would not consent to ; and so , as something to remember her by , she presented me with a roll of fine matting , and another of tappa . these gifts placed in my hammock , i afterward found very agreeable in the warm latitudes to which we were bound ; nor did they fail to awaken most grateful remembrances .
melville	omoo	about nightfall , we broke away from this generous-hearted household , and hurried down to the water . it was a mad , merry night among the sailors ; they had on tap a small cask of wine , procured in the same way as the doctor ’ s flasks .
melville	omoo	an hour or two after midnight , everything was noiseless ; but when the first streak of the dawn showed itself over the mountains , a sharp voice hailed the forecastle , and ordered the ship unmoored .
melville	omoo	the anchors came up cheerily ; the sails were soon set ; and with the early breath of the tropical morning , fresh and fragrant from the hillsides , we slowly glided down the bay , and were swept through the opening in the reef . presently we “ hove to , ” and the canoes came alongside to take off the islanders who had accompanied us thus far . as he stepped over the side , i shook the doctor long and heartily by the hand . i have never seen or heard of him since .
melville	omoo	crowding all sail , we braced the yards square ; and , the breeze freshening , bowled straight away from the land . once more the sailor ’ s cradle rocked under me , and i found myself rolling in my gait .

shakespeare	romeo	friar lawrence . you say you do not know the lady ’ s mind . uneven is the course ; i like it not . paris . immoderately she weeps for tybalt ’ s death , and therefore have i little talk ’ d of love ; for venus smiles not in a house of tears . now , sir , her father counts it dangerous that she do give her sorrow so much sway ; and in his wisdom , hastes our marriage , to stop the inundation of her tears , which , too much minded by herself alone , may be put from her by society . now do you know the reason of this haste .

shakespeare	romeo	friar lawrence . hold , daughter . i do spy a kind of hope , which craves as desperate an execution as that is desperate which we would prevent . if , rather than to marry county paris thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself , then is it likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death to chide away this shame , that cop ’ st with death himself to scape from it . and if thou dar ’ st , i ’ ll give thee remedy .
shakespeare	romeo	juliet . o , bid me leap , rather than marry paris , from off the battlements of yonder tower , or walk in thievish ways , or bid me lurk where serpents are . chain me with roaring bears ; or hide me nightly in a charnel-house , o ’ er-cover ’ d quite with dead men ’ s rattling bones , with reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls . or bid me go into a new-made grave , and hide me with a dead man in his shroud ; things that , to hear them told , have made me tremble , and i will do it without fear or doubt , to live an unstain ’ d wife to my sweet love .
shakespeare	romeo	friar lawrence . hold then . go home , be merry , give consent to marry paris . wednesday is tomorrow ; tomorrow night look that thou lie alone , let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber . take thou this vial , being then in bed , and this distilled liquor drink thou off , when presently through all thy veins shall run a cold and drowsy humour ; for no pulse shall keep his native progress , but surcease . no warmth , no breath shall testify thou livest , the roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade to paly ashes ; thy eyes ’ windows fall , like death when he shuts up the day of life . each part depriv ’ d of supple government , shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death . and in this borrow ’ d likeness of shrunk death thou shalt continue two and forty hours , and then awake as from a pleasant sleep . now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed , there art thou dead . then as the manner of our country is , in thy best robes , uncover ’ d , on the bier , thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all the kindred of the capulets lie . in the meantime , against thou shalt awake , shall romeo by my letters know our drift , and hither shall he come , and he and i will watch thy waking , and that very night shall romeo bear thee hence to mantua . and this shall free thee from this present shame , if no inconstant toy nor womanish fear abate thy valour in the acting it .
shakespeare	romeo	juliet . give me , give me ! o tell not me of fear ! friar lawrence . hold ; get you gone , be strong and prosperous in this resolve . i ’ ll send a friar with speed to mantua , with my letters to thy lord .

shakespeare	romeo	prince . then say at once what thou dost know in this . friar lawrence . i will be brief , for my short date of breath is not so long as is a tedious tale . romeo , there dead , was husband to that juliet , and she , there dead , that romeo ’ s faithful wife . i married them ; and their stol ’ n marriage day was tybalt ’ s doomsday , whose untimely death banish ’ d the new-made bridegroom from this city ; for whom , and not for tybalt , juliet pin ’ d . you , to remove that siege of grief from her , betroth ’ d , and would have married her perforce to county paris . then comes she to me , and with wild looks , bid me devise some means to rid her from this second marriage , or in my cell there would she kill herself . then gave i her , so tutored by my art , a sleeping potion , which so took effect as i intended , for it wrought on her the form of death . meantime i writ to romeo that he should hither come as this dire night to help to take her from her borrow ’ d grave , being the time the potion ’ s force should cease . but he which bore my letter , friar john , was stay ’ d by accident ; and yesternight return ’ d my letter back . then all alone at the prefixed hour of her waking came i to take her from her kindred ’ s vault , meaning to keep her closely at my cell till i conveniently could send to romeo . but when i came , some minute ere the time of her awaking , here untimely lay the noble paris and true romeo dead . she wakes ; and i entreated her come forth and bear this work of heaven with patience . but then a noise did scare me from the tomb ; and she , too desperate , would not go with me , but , as it seems , did violence on herself . all this i know ; and to the marriage her nurse is privy . and if ought in this miscarried by my fault , let my old life be sacrific ’ d , some hour before his time , unto the rigour of severest law .
shakespeare	romeo	prince . we still have known thee for a holy man . where ’ s romeo ’ s man ? what can he say to this ? balthasar . i brought my master news of juliet ’ s death , and then in post he came from mantua to this same place , to this same monument . this letter he early bid me give his father , and threaten ’ d me with death , going in the vault , if i departed not , and left him there .
shakespeare	romeo	prince . give me the letter , i will look on it . where is the county ’ s page that rais ’ d the watch ? sirrah , what made your master in this place ? page . he came with flowers to strew his lady ’ s grave , and bid me stand aloof , and so i did . anon comes one with light to ope the tomb , and by and by my master drew on him , and then i ran away to call the watch .
shakespeare	romeo	prince . this letter doth make good the friar ’ s words , their course of love , the tidings of her death . and here he writes that he did buy a poison of a poor ’ pothecary , and therewithal came to this vault to die , and lie with juliet . where be these enemies ? capulet , montague , see what a scourge is laid upon your hate , that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love ! and i , for winking at your discords too , have lost a brace of kinsmen . all are punish ’ d .

shakespeare	othello	desdemona . by heaven , you do me wrong . othello . are not you a strumpet ? desdemona . no , as i am a christian : if to preserve this vessel for my lord from any other foul unlawful touch be not to be a strumpet , i am none .

shakespeare	othello	iago . will you hear me , roderigo ? roderigo . faith , i have heard too much , for your words and performances are no kin together . iago . you charge me most unjustly . roderigo . with naught but truth . i have wasted myself out of my means . the jewels you have had from me to deliver to desdemona would half have corrupted a votarist : you have told me she hath received them , and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance , but i find none .

shakespeare	othello	roderigo . it hath not appeared . iago . i grant indeed it hath not appeared , and your suspicion is not without wit and judgement . but , roderigo , if thou hast that in thee indeed , which i have greater reason to believe now than ever , —i mean purpose , courage , and valour , —this night show it . if thou the next night following enjoy not desdemona , take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life .
shakespeare	othello	roderigo . well , what is it ? is it within reason and compass ? iago . sir , there is especial commission come from venice to depute cassio in othello ’ s place . roderigo . is that true ? why then othello and desdemona return again to venice .
shakespeare	othello	iago . o , no ; he goes into mauritania , and takes away with him the fair desdemona , unless his abode be lingered here by some accident : wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of cassio .
shakespeare	othello	roderigo . how do you mean “ removing ” of him ? iago . why , by making him uncapable of othello ’ s place : knocking out his brains . roderigo . and that you would have me to do ?
shakespeare	othello	iago . ay , if you dare do yourself a profit and a right . he sups tonight with a harlotry , and thither will i go to him . he knows not yet of his honourable fortune . if you will watch his going thence , which i will fashion to fall out between twelve and one , you may take him at your pleasure : i will be near to second your attempt , and he shall fall between us . come , stand not amazed at it , but go along with me . i will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him . it is now high supper-time , and the night grows to waste . about it .

shakespeare	othello	desdemona . i do not think there is any such woman . emilia . yes , a dozen ; and as many to the vantage as would store the world they played for . but i do think it is their husbands ’ faults if wives do fall : say that they slack their duties , and pour our treasures into foreign laps ; or else break out in peevish jealousies , throwing restraint upon us . or say they strike us , or scant our former having in despite . why , we have galls ; and though we have some grace , yet have we some revenge . let husbands know their wives have sense like them : they see , and smell and have their palates both for sweet and sour , as husbands have . what is it that they do when they change us for others ? is it sport ? i think it is . and doth affection breed it ? i think it doth . is ’ t frailty that thus errs ? it is so too . and have not we affections , desires for sport , and frailty , as men have ? then let them use us well : else let them know , the ills we do , their ills instruct us so .

shakespeare	midsummer	[ _they sleep._ ] oberon advances . enter puck . oberon . welcome , good robin . seest thou this sweet sight ? her dotage now i do begin to pity . for , meeting her of late behind the wood , seeking sweet favours for this hateful fool , i did upbraid her and fall out with her : for she his hairy temples then had rounded with coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers ; and that same dew , which sometime on the buds was wont to swell like round and orient pearls , stood now within the pretty flouriets ’ eyes , like tears that did their own disgrace bewail . when i had at my pleasure taunted her , and she in mild terms begg ’ d my patience , i then did ask of her her changeling child ; which straight she gave me , and her fairy sent to bear him to my bower in fairyland . and now i have the boy , i will undo this hateful imperfection of her eyes . and , gentle puck , take this transformèd scalp from off the head of this athenian swain , that he awaking when the other do , may all to athens back again repair , and think no more of this night ’ s accidents but as the fierce vexation of a dream . but first i will release the fairy queen .

shakespeare	midsummer	[ _exit an attendant._ ] we will , fair queen , up to the mountain ’ s top , and mark the musical confusion of hounds and echo in conjunction . hippolyta . i was with hercules and cadmus once , when in a wood of crete they bay ’ d the bear with hounds of sparta . never did i hear such gallant chiding ; for , besides the groves , the skies , the fountains , every region near seem ’ d all one mutual cry . i never heard so musical a discord , such sweet thunder .
shakespeare	midsummer	theseus . my hounds are bred out of the spartan kind , so flew ’ d , so sanded ; and their heads are hung with ears that sweep away the morning dew ; crook-knee ’ d and dewlap ’ d like thessalian bulls ; slow in pursuit , but match ’ d in mouth like bells , each under each . a cry more tuneable was never holla ’ d to , nor cheer ’ d with horn , in crete , in sparta , nor in thessaly . judge when you hear.—but , soft , what nymphs are these ?
shakespeare	midsummer	egeus . my lord , this is my daughter here asleep , and this lysander ; this demetrius is ; this helena , old nedar ’ s helena : i wonder of their being here together . theseus . no doubt they rose up early to observe the rite of may ; and , hearing our intent , came here in grace of our solemnity . but speak , egeus ; is not this the day that hermia should give answer of her choice ?
shakespeare	midsummer	egeus . it is , my lord . theseus . go , bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns . horns , and shout within . demetrius , lysander , hermia and helena wake and start up . good morrow , friends . saint valentine is past . begin these wood-birds but to couple now ?
shakespeare	midsummer	lysander . pardon , my lord . he and the rest kneel to theseus . theseus . i pray you all , stand up . i know you two are rival enemies . how comes this gentle concord in the world , that hatred is so far from jealousy to sleep by hate , and fear no enmity ?
shakespeare	midsummer	lysander . my lord , i shall reply amazedly , half sleep , half waking ; but as yet , i swear , i can not truly say how i came here . but , as i think ( for truly would i speak ) and now i do bethink me , so it is : i came with hermia hither . our intent was to be gone from athens , where we might be , without the peril of the athenian law .
shakespeare	midsummer	egeus . enough , enough , my lord ; you have enough . i beg the law , the law upon his head . they would have stol ’ n away , they would , demetrius , thereby to have defeated you and me : you of your wife , and me of my consent , of my consent that she should be your wife .
shakespeare	midsummer	demetrius . my lord , fair helen told me of their stealth , of this their purpose hither to this wood ; and i in fury hither follow ’ d them , fair helena in fancy following me . but , my good lord , i wot not by what power , ( but by some power it is ) my love to hermia , melted as the snow , seems to me now as the remembrance of an idle gaud which in my childhood i did dote upon ; and all the faith , the virtue of my heart , the object and the pleasure of mine eye , is only helena . to her , my lord , was i betroth ’ d ere i saw hermia . but like a sickness did i loathe this food . but , as in health , come to my natural taste , now i do wish it , love it , long for it , and will for evermore be true to it .
shakespeare	midsummer	theseus . fair lovers , you are fortunately met . of this discourse we more will hear anon . egeus , i will overbear your will ; for in the temple , by and by with us , these couples shall eternally be knit . and , for the morning now is something worn , our purpos ’ d hunting shall be set aside . away with us to athens . three and three , we ’ ll hold a feast in great solemnity . come , hippolyta .
shakespeare	midsummer	[ _exeunt theseus , hippolyta , egeus and train._ ] demetrius . these things seem small and undistinguishable , like far-off mountains turnèd into clouds . hermia . methinks i see these things with parted eye , when everything seems double .
shakespeare	midsummer	helena . so methinks . and i have found demetrius like a jewel , mine own , and not mine own . demetrius . are you sure that we are awake ? it seems to me that yet we sleep , we dream . do not you think the duke was here , and bid us follow him ?
shakespeare	midsummer	hermia . yea , and my father . helena . and hippolyta . lysander . and he did bid us follow to the temple . demetrius . why , then , we are awake : let ’ s follow him , and by the way let us recount our dreams .
shakespeare	midsummer	[ _exeunt._ ] bottom .

shakespeare	midsummer	[ _exit._ ] scene ii . athens . a room in quince ’ s house enter quince , flute , snout and starveling . quince . have you sent to bottom ’ s house ? is he come home yet ? starveling . he can not be heard of . out of doubt he is transported .
shakespeare	midsummer	flute . if he come not , then the play is marred . it goes not forward , doth it ? quince . it is not possible . you have not a man in all athens able to discharge pyramus but he .
shakespeare	midsummer	flute . no , he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in athens . quince . yea , and the best person too , and he is a very paramour for a sweet voice .
shakespeare	midsummer	flute . you must say paragon . a paramour is , god bless us , a thing of naught . enter snug . snug masters , the duke is coming from the temple , and there is two or three lords and ladies more married . if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men .
shakespeare	midsummer	flute . o sweet bully bottom ! thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life ; he could not have ’ scaped sixpence a day . an the duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing pyramus , i ’ ll be hanged . he would have deserved it : sixpence a day in pyramus , or nothing .
shakespeare	midsummer	enter bottom . bottom . where are these lads ? where are these hearts ? quince . bottom ! o most courageous day ! o most happy hour ! bottom . masters , i am to discourse wonders : but ask me not what ; for if i tell you , i am not true athenian . i will tell you everything , right as it fell out .
shakespeare	midsummer	quince . let us hear , sweet bottom . bottom . not a word of me . all that i will tell you is , that the duke hath dined . get your apparel together , good strings to your beards , new ribbons to your pumps ; meet presently at the palace ; every man look o ’ er his part . for the short and the long is , our play is preferred . in any case , let thisbe have clean linen ; and let not him that plays the lion pare his nails , for they shall hang out for the lion ’ s claws . and most dear actors , eat no onions nor garlick , for we are to utter sweet breath ; and i do not doubt but to hear them say it is a sweet comedy . no more words . away ! go , away !
shakespeare	midsummer	[ _exeunt._ ] act v scene i. athens . an apartment in the palace of theseus enter theseus , hippolyta , philostrate , lords and attendants . hippolyta . ’ tis strange , my theseus , that these lovers speak of .
shakespeare	midsummer	theseus . more strange than true . i never may believe these antique fables , nor these fairy toys . lovers and madmen have such seething brains , such shaping fantasies , that apprehend more than cool reason ever comprehends . the lunatic , the lover , and the poet are of imagination all compact : one sees more devils than vast hell can hold ; that is the madman : the lover , all as frantic , sees helen ’ s beauty in a brow of egypt : the poet ’ s eye , in a fine frenzy rolling , doth glance from heaven to earth , from earth to heaven ; and as imagination bodies forth the forms of things unknown , the poet ’ s pen turns them to shapes , and gives to airy nothing a local habitation and a name . such tricks hath strong imagination , that if it would but apprehend some joy , it comprehends some bringer of that joy . or in the night , imagining some fear , how easy is a bush supposed a bear ?
shakespeare	midsummer	hippolyta . but all the story of the night told over , and all their minds transfigur ’ d so together , more witnesseth than fancy ’ s images , and grows to something of great constancy ; but , howsoever , strange and admirable .
shakespeare	midsummer	enter lovers : lysander , demetrius , hermia and helena . theseus . here come the lovers , full of joy and mirth . joy , gentle friends , joy and fresh days of love accompany your hearts ! lysander . more than to us wait in your royal walks , your board , your bed !
shakespeare	midsummer	theseus . come now ; what masques , what dances shall we have , to wear away this long age of three hours between our after-supper and bed-time ? where is our usual manager of mirth ? what revels are in hand ? is there no play to ease the anguish of a torturing hour ? call philostrate .
shakespeare	midsummer	philostrate . here , mighty theseus . theseus . say , what abridgment have you for this evening ? what masque ? what music ? how shall we beguile the lazy time , if not with some delight ? philostrate . there is a brief how many sports are ripe . make choice of which your highness will see first .
shakespeare	midsummer	[ _giving a paper._ ] theseus . [ _reads_ ] ‘ the battle with the centaurs , to be sung by an athenian eunuch to the harp. ’ we ’ ll none of that . that have i told my love in glory of my kinsman hercules . ‘ the riot of the tipsy bacchanals , tearing the thracian singer in their rage ? ’ that is an old device , and it was play ’ d when i from thebes came last a conqueror . ‘ the thrice three muses mourning for the death of learning , late deceas ’ d in beggary. ’ that is some satire , keen and critical , not sorting with a nuptial ceremony . ‘ a tedious brief scene of young pyramus and his love thisbe ; very tragical mirth. ’ merry and tragical ? tedious and brief ? that is hot ice and wondrous strange snow . how shall we find the concord of this discord ?
shakespeare	midsummer	philostrate . a play there is , my lord , some ten words long , which is as brief as i have known a play ; but by ten words , my lord , it is too long , which makes it tedious . for in all the play there is not one word apt , one player fitted . and tragical , my noble lord , it is . for pyramus therein doth kill himself , which , when i saw rehears ’ d , i must confess , made mine eyes water ; but more merry tears the passion of loud laughter never shed .
shakespeare	midsummer	theseus . what are they that do play it ? philostrate . hard-handed men that work in athens here , which never labour ’ d in their minds till now ; and now have toil ’ d their unbreath ’ d memories with this same play against your nuptial .
shakespeare	midsummer	theseus . and we will hear it . philostrate . no , my noble lord , it is not for you : i have heard it over , and it is nothing , nothing in the world ; unless you can find sport in their intents , extremely stretch ’ d and conn ’ d with cruel pain to do you service .
shakespeare	midsummer	theseus . i will hear that play ; for never anything can be amiss when simpleness and duty tender it . go , bring them in : and take your places , ladies . [ _exit philostrate._ ] hippolyta . i love not to see wretchedness o ’ ercharged , and duty in his service perishing .
shakespeare	midsummer	theseus . why , gentle sweet , you shall see no such thing . hippolyta . he says they can do nothing in this kind . theseus . the kinder we , to give them thanks for nothing . our sport shall be to take what they mistake : and what poor duty can not do , noble respect takes it in might , not merit . where i have come , great clerks have purposed to greet me with premeditated welcomes ; where i have seen them shiver and look pale , make periods in the midst of sentences , throttle their practis ’ d accent in their fears , and , in conclusion , dumbly have broke off , not paying me a welcome . trust me , sweet , out of this silence yet i pick ’ d a welcome ; and in the modesty of fearful duty i read as much as from the rattling tongue of saucy and audacious eloquence . love , therefore , and tongue-tied simplicity in least speak most to my capacity .
shakespeare	midsummer	enter philostrate . philostrate . so please your grace , the prologue is address ’ d . theseus . let him approach . flourish of trumpets . enter the prologue . prologue if we offend , it is with our good will . that you should think , we come not to offend , but with good will . to show our simple skill , that is the true beginning of our end . consider then , we come but in despite . we do not come , as minding to content you , our true intent is . all for your delight we are not here . that you should here repent you , the actors are at hand , and , by their show , you shall know all that you are like to know .
shakespeare	midsummer	theseus . this fellow doth not stand upon points . lysander . he hath rid his prologue like a rough colt ; he knows not the stop . a good moral , my lord : it is not enough to speak , but to speak true .
shakespeare	midsummer	hippolyta . indeed he hath played on this prologue like a child on a recorder ; a sound , but not in government . theseus . his speech was like a tangled chain ; nothing impaired , but all disordered . who is next ?
shakespeare	midsummer	enter pyramus and thisbe , wall , moonshine and lion as in dumb show . prologue gentles , perchance you wonder at this show ; but wonder on , till truth make all things plain . this man is pyramus , if you would know ; this beauteous lady thisbe is certain . this man , with lime and rough-cast , doth present wall , that vile wall which did these lovers sunder ; and through wall ’ s chink , poor souls , they are content to whisper , at the which let no man wonder . this man , with lanthern , dog , and bush of thorn , presenteth moonshine , for , if you will know , by moonshine did these lovers think no scorn to meet at ninus ’ tomb , there , there to woo . this grisly beast ( which lion hight by name ) the trusty thisbe , coming first by night , did scare away , or rather did affright ; and as she fled , her mantle she did fall ; which lion vile with bloody mouth did stain . anon comes pyramus , sweet youth , and tall , and finds his trusty thisbe ’ s mantle slain ; whereat with blade , with bloody blameful blade , he bravely broach ’ d his boiling bloody breast ; and thisbe , tarrying in mulberry shade , his dagger drew , and died . for all the rest , let lion , moonshine , wall , and lovers twain , at large discourse while here they do remain .
shakespeare	midsummer	[ _exeunt prologue , pyramus , thisbe , lion and moonshine._ ] theseus . i wonder if the lion be to speak . demetrius . no wonder , my lord . one lion may , when many asses do . wall . in this same interlude it doth befall that i , one snout by name , present a wall : and such a wall as i would have you think that had in it a crannied hole or chink , through which the lovers , pyramus and thisbe , did whisper often very secretly . this loam , this rough-cast , and this stone , doth show that i am that same wall ; the truth is so : and this the cranny is , right and sinister , through which the fearful lovers are to whisper .
shakespeare	midsummer	theseus . would you desire lime and hair to speak better ? demetrius . it is the wittiest partition that ever i heard discourse , my lord . theseus . pyramus draws near the wall ; silence .
shakespeare	midsummer	enter pyramus . pyramus . o grim-look ’ d night ! o night with hue so black ! o night , which ever art when day is not ! o night , o night , alack , alack , alack , i fear my thisbe ’ s promise is forgot ! and thou , o wall , o sweet , o lovely wall , that stand ’ st between her father ’ s ground and mine ; thou wall , o wall , o sweet and lovely wall , show me thy chink , to blink through with mine eyne .
shakespeare	midsummer	[ _wall holds up his fingers._ ] thanks , courteous wall : jove shield thee well for this ! but what see i ? no thisbe do i see . o wicked wall , through whom i see no bliss , curs ’ d be thy stones for thus deceiving me !
shakespeare	midsummer	theseus . the wall , methinks , being sensible , should curse again . pyramus . no , in truth , sir , he should not . ‘ deceiving me ’ is thisbe ’ s cue : she is to enter now , and i am to spy her through the wall . you shall see it will fall pat as i told you . yonder she comes .
shakespeare	midsummer	enter thisbe . thisbe . o wall , full often hast thou heard my moans , for parting my fair pyramus and me . my cherry lips have often kiss ’ d thy stones , thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee .
shakespeare	midsummer	pyramus . i see a voice ; now will i to the chink , to spy an i can hear my thisbe ’ s face . thisbe ? thisbe . my love thou art , my love i think .
shakespeare	midsummer	pyramus . think what thou wilt , i am thy lover ’ s grace ; and like limander am i trusty still . thisbe . and i like helen , till the fates me kill . pyramus . not shafalus to procrus was so true .
shakespeare	midsummer	thisbe . as shafalus to procrus , i to you . pyramus . o kiss me through the hole of this vile wall . thisbe . i kiss the wall ’ s hole , not your lips at all .
shakespeare	midsummer	pyramus . wilt thou at ninny ’ s tomb meet me straightway ? thisbe . ’ tide life , ’ tide death , i come without delay . wall . thus have i , wall , my part discharged so ; and , being done , thus wall away doth go .
shakespeare	midsummer	[ _exeunt wall , pyramus and thisbe._ ] theseus . now is the mural down between the two neighbours . demetrius . no remedy , my lord , when walls are so wilful to hear without warning . hippolyta . this is the silliest stuff that ever i heard .
shakespeare	midsummer	theseus . the best in this kind are but shadows ; and the worst are no worse , if imagination amend them . hippolyta . it must be your imagination then , and not theirs . theseus . if we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves , they may pass for excellent men . here come two noble beasts in , a man and a lion .
shakespeare	midsummer	enter lion and moonshine . lion . you , ladies , you , whose gentle hearts do fear the smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor , may now , perchance , both quake and tremble here , when lion rough in wildest rage doth roar . then know that i , one snug the joiner , am a lion fell , nor else no lion ’ s dam ; for if i should as lion come in strife into this place , ’ twere pity on my life .
shakespeare	midsummer	theseus . a very gentle beast , and of a good conscience . demetrius . the very best at a beast , my lord , that e ’ er i saw . lysander . this lion is a very fox for his valour .
shakespeare	midsummer	theseus . true ; and a goose for his discretion . demetrius . not so , my lord , for his valour can not carry his discretion , and the fox carries the goose . theseus . his discretion , i am sure , can not carry his valour ; for the goose carries not the fox . it is well ; leave it to his discretion , and let us listen to the moon .
shakespeare	midsummer	moonshine . this lanthorn doth the hornèd moon present . demetrius . he should have worn the horns on his head . theseus . he is no crescent , and his horns are invisible within the circumference .
shakespeare	midsummer	moonshine . this lanthorn doth the hornèd moon present ; myself the man i ’ the moon do seem to be . theseus . this is the greatest error of all the rest ; the man should be put into the lantern . how is it else the man i ’ the moon ?
shakespeare	midsummer	demetrius . he dares not come there for the candle , for you see , it is already in snuff . hippolyta . i am aweary of this moon . would he would change ! theseus . it appears by his small light of discretion that he is in the wane ; but yet , in courtesy , in all reason , we must stay the time .
shakespeare	midsummer	lysander . proceed , moon . moon all that i have to say , is to tell you that the lantern is the moon ; i the man i ’ the moon ; this thorn-bush my thorn-bush ; and this dog my dog .
shakespeare	midsummer	demetrius . why , all these should be in the lantern , for all these are in the moon . but silence ; here comes thisbe . enter thisbe . thisbe . this is old ninny ’ s tomb . where is my love ?
shakespeare	midsummer	lion . oh ! [ _the lion roars , thisbe runs off._ ] demetrius . well roared , lion . theseus . well run , thisbe . hippolyta . well shone , moon . truly , the moon shines with a good grace . [ _the lion tears thisbe ’ s mantle , and exit._ ]
shakespeare	midsummer	theseus . well moused , lion . demetrius . and then came pyramus . lysander . and so the lion vanished . enter pyramus . pyramus . sweet moon , i thank thee for thy sunny beams ; i thank thee , moon , for shining now so bright ; for , by thy gracious golden , glittering gleams , i trust to take of truest thisbe sight . but stay ! o spite ! but mark , poor knight , what dreadful dole is here ! eyes , do you see ? how can it be ? o dainty duck ! o dear ! thy mantle good , what , stained with blood ? approach , ye furies fell ! o fates , come , come ; cut thread and thrum ; quail , rush , conclude , and quell !
shakespeare	midsummer	theseus . this passion , and the death of a dear friend , would go near to make a man look sad . hippolyta . beshrew my heart , but i pity the man . pyramus . o wherefore , nature , didst thou lions frame , since lion vile hath here deflower ’ d my dear ? which is—no , no—which was the fairest dame that liv ’ d , that lov ’ d , that lik ’ d , that look ’ d with cheer . come , tears , confound ! out , sword , and wound the pap of pyramus ; ay , that left pap , where heart doth hop : thus die i , thus , thus , thus . now am i dead , now am i fled ; my soul is in the sky . tongue , lose thy light ! moon , take thy flight ! now die , die , die , die , die .
shakespeare	midsummer	[ _dies . exit moonshine._ ] demetrius . no die , but an ace , for him ; for he is but one . lysander . less than an ace , man ; for he is dead , he is nothing . theseus . with the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass .
shakespeare	midsummer	hippolyta . how chance moonshine is gone before thisbe comes back and finds her lover ? theseus . she will find him by starlight . enter thisbe . here she comes , and her passion ends the play .
shakespeare	midsummer	hippolyta . methinks she should not use a long one for such a pyramus . i hope she will be brief . demetrius . a mote will turn the balance , which pyramus , which thisbe , is the better : he for a man , god warrant us ; she for a woman , god bless us !
shakespeare	midsummer	lysander . she hath spied him already with those sweet eyes . demetrius . and thus she means , _videlicet_— thisbe . asleep , my love ? what , dead , my dove ? o pyramus , arise , speak , speak . quite dumb ? dead , dead ? a tomb must cover thy sweet eyes . these lily lips , this cherry nose , these yellow cowslip cheeks , are gone , are gone ! lovers , make moan ; his eyes were green as leeks . o sisters three , come , come to me , with hands as pale as milk ; lay them in gore , since you have shore with shears his thread of silk . tongue , not a word : come , trusty sword , come , blade , my breast imbrue ; and farewell , friends . thus thisbe ends . adieu , adieu , adieu .
shakespeare	midsummer	[ _dies._ ] theseus . moonshine and lion are left to bury the dead . demetrius . ay , and wall too . bottom . no , i assure you ; the wall is down that parted their fathers . will it please you to see the epilogue , or to hear a bergomask dance between two of our company ?
shakespeare	midsummer	theseus . no epilogue , i pray you ; for your play needs no excuse . never excuse ; for when the players are all dead there need none to be blamed . marry , if he that writ it had played pyramus , and hanged himself in thisbe ’ s garter , it would have been a fine tragedy ; and so it is , truly ; and very notably discharged . but come , your bergomask ; let your epilogue alone .

shakespeare	midsummer	enter oberon and titania with their train . oberon . through the house give glimmering light , by the dead and drowsy fire . every elf and fairy sprite hop as light as bird from brier , and this ditty after me , sing and dance it trippingly .
shakespeare	midsummer	titania . first rehearse your song by rote , to each word a warbling note ; hand in hand , with fairy grace , will we sing , and bless this place . [ _song and dance._ ] oberon . now , until the break of day , through this house each fairy stray . to the best bride-bed will we , which by us shall blessèd be ; and the issue there create ever shall be fortunate . so shall all the couples three ever true in loving be ; and the blots of nature ’ s hand shall not in their issue stand : never mole , hare-lip , nor scar , nor mark prodigious , such as are despised in nativity , shall upon their children be . with this field-dew consecrate , every fairy take his gait , and each several chamber bless , through this palace , with sweet peace ; and the owner of it blest . ever shall it in safety rest , trip away . make no stay ; meet me all by break of day .
shakespeare	midsummer	[ _exeunt oberon , titania and train._ ] puck . if we shadows have offended , think but this , and all is mended , that you have but slumber ’ d here while these visions did appear . and this weak and idle theme , no more yielding but a dream , gentles , do not reprehend . if you pardon , we will mend . and , as i am an honest puck , if we have unearnèd luck now to ’ scape the serpent ’ s tongue , we will make amends ere long ; else the puck a liar call . so , good night unto you all . give me your hands , if we be friends , and robin shall restore amends .
