austen	emma	chapter ii no misfortune occurred , again to prevent the ball . the day approached , the day arrived ; and after a morning of some anxious watching , frank churchill , in all the certainty of his own self , reached randalls before dinner , and every thing was safe .
austen	emma	during his present short stay , emma had barely seen him ; but just enough to feel that the first meeting was over , and to give her the impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique and pretension , now spread over his air . she was , in fact , beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all ; and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings , that , except in a moral light , as a penance , a lesson , a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind , she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again . she wished him very well ; but he gave her pain , and his welfare twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction .
austen	emma	mrs. weston ’ s communications furnished emma with more food for unpleasant reflection , by increasing her esteem and compassion , and her sense of past injustice towards miss fairfax . she bitterly regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her , and blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been , in some measure , the cause . had she followed mr. knightley ’ s known wishes , in paying that attention to miss fairfax , which was every way her due ; had she tried to know her better ; had she done her part towards intimacy ; had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in harriet smith ; she must , in all probability , have been spared from every pain which pressed on her now.—birth , abilities , and education , had been equally marking one as an associate for her , to be received with gratitude ; and the other—what was she ? —supposing even that they had never become intimate friends ; that she had never been admitted into miss fairfax ’ s confidence on this important matter—which was most probable—still , in knowing her as she ought , and as she might , she must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to mr. dixon , which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself , but had so unpardonably imparted ; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of jane ’ s feelings , by the levity or carelessness of frank churchill ’ s . of all the sources of evil surrounding the former , since her coming to highbury , she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst . she must have been a perpetual enemy . they never could have been all three together , without her having stabbed jane fairfax ’ s peace in a thousand instances ; and on box hill , perhaps , it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no more .
austen	emma	“ that ’ s true , ” she cried— “ very true . little emma , grow up a better woman than your aunt . be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited . now , mr. knightley , a word or two more , and i have done . as far as good intentions went , we were _both_ right , and i must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong . i only want to know that mr. martin is not very , very bitterly disappointed . ”
austen	emma	“ oh ! i always deserve the best treatment , because i never put up with any other ; and , therefore , you must give me a plain , direct answer . are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which mr. martin and harriet now are ? ”
austen	emma	miss smith , and miss bickerton , another parlour boarder at mrs. goddard ’ s , who had been also at the ball , had walked out together , and taken a road , the richmond road , which , though apparently public enough for safety , had led them into alarm.—about half a mile beyond highbury , making a sudden turn , and deeply shaded by elms on each side , it became for a considerable stretch very retired ; and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it , they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them , on a broader patch of greensward by the side , a party of gipsies . a child on the watch , came towards them to beg ; and miss bickerton , excessively frightened , gave a great scream , and calling on harriet to follow her , ran up a steep bank , cleared a slight hedge at the top , and made the best of her way by a short cut back to highbury . but poor harriet could not follow . she had suffered very much from cramp after dancing , and her first attempt to mount the bank brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless—and in this state , and exceedingly terrified , she had been obliged to remain .
austen	emma	“ so scrupulous for others , ” he continued , “ and yet so careless for herself ! she wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day , and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat herself . is this fair , mrs. weston ? —judge between us . have not i some right to complain ? i am sure of your kind support and aid . ”
austen	emma	mr. weston , on his side , added a virtue to the account which must have some weight . he gave her to understand that frank admired her extremely—thought her very beautiful and very charming ; and with so much to be said for him altogether , she found she must not judge him harshly . as mrs. weston observed , “ all young people would have their little whims . ”
austen	emma	“ but i am afraid , mr. elton , harriet will not like to sit . she thinks so little of her own beauty . did not you observe her manner of answering me ? how completely it meant , ‘ why should my picture be drawn ? ’ ”
austen	emma	emma saw mrs. weston ’ s surprize , and felt that it must be great , at an address which , in words and manner , was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her ; and as for herself , she was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose . she could only give him a look ; but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses , and then left the sofa , removing to a seat by her sister , and giving her all her attention .
austen	emma	“ dear emma bears every thing so well , ” said her father . “ but , mr. knightley , she is really very sorry to lose poor miss taylor , and i am sure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for . ”
austen	emma	she wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration . that would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance ! and yet , she could not help rather anticipating something decisive . she felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis , an event , a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state .
austen	emma	“ yes , you were very cross ; and i do not know what about , except that you were too late for the best strawberries . i was a kinder friend than you deserved . but you were humble . you begged hard to be commanded to come . ”
austen	emma	now emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte ; and the remembrance of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing , that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough ; and , with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt , took leave .
austen	emma	he came back , had had his hair cut , and laughed at himself with a very good grace , but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had done . he had no reason to wish his hair longer , to conceal any confusion of face ; no reason to wish the money unspent , to improve his spirits . he was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever ; and , after seeing him , emma thus moralised to herself : —
austen	emma	“ we are sure of excellent fires , ” continued he , “ and every thing in the greatest comfort . charming people , mr. and mrs. weston ; —mrs . weston indeed is much beyond praise , and he is exactly what one values , so hospitable , and so fond of society ; —it will be a small party , but where small parties are select , they are perhaps the most agreeable of any . mr. weston ’ s dining-room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably ; and for my part , i would rather , under such circumstances , fall short by two than exceed by two . i think you will agree with me , ( turning with a soft air to emma , ) i think i shall certainly have your approbation , though mr. knightley perhaps , from being used to the large parties of london , may not quite enter into our feelings . ”
austen	emma	“ a degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance , to be married to a respectable , intelligent gentleman-farmer ! ” “ as to the circumstances of her birth , though in a legal sense she may be called nobody , it will not hold in common sense . she is not to pay for the offence of others , by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up.—there can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentleman—and a gentleman of fortune.—her allowance is very liberal ; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort.—that she is a gentleman ’ s daughter , is indubitable to me ; that she associates with gentlemen ’ s daughters , no one , i apprehend , will deny.—she is superior to mr. robert martin . ”
austen	emma	“ i do not know what i could imagine , but i confess that i have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers . but i am a partial old friend . ”
austen	emma	emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary , indeed , and that she had not a syllable to say for him . “ i can not imagine , ” said mrs. elton , ( feeling the indignity as a wife ought to do , ) “ i can not imagine how he could do such a thing by you , of all people in the world ! the very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten ! —my dear mr. e. , he must have left a message for you , i am sure he must.—not even knightley could be so very eccentric ; —and his servants forgot it . depend upon it , that was the case : and very likely to happen with the donwell servants , who are all , i have often observed , extremely awkward and remiss.—i am sure i would not have such a creature as his harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration . and as for mrs. hodges , wright holds her very cheap indeed.—she promised wright a receipt , and never sent it . ”
austen	emma	after this speech he was gone as soon as possible . emma could not think it too soon ; for with all his good and agreeable qualities , there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh . she ran away to indulge the inclination , leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to harriet ’ s share .
austen	emma	for a moment or two nothing was said , and she was unsuspicious of having excited any particular interest , till she found her arm drawn within his , and pressed against his heart , and heard him thus saying , in a tone of great sensibility , speaking low ,
austen	emma	but the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change to her destiny . this was colonel campbell , who had very highly regarded fairfax , as an excellent officer and most deserving young man ; and farther , had been indebted to him for such attentions , during a severe camp-fever , as he believed had saved his life . these were claims which he did not learn to overlook , though some years passed away from the death of poor fairfax , before his own return to england put any thing in his power . when he did return , he sought out the child and took notice of her . he was a married man , with only one living child , a girl , about jane ’ s age : and jane became their guest , paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all ; and before she was nine years old , his daughter ’ s great fondness for her , and his own wish of being a real friend , united to produce an offer from colonel campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education . it was accepted ; and from that period jane had belonged to colonel campbell ’ s family , and had lived with them entirely , only visiting her grandmother from time to time .
austen	emma	“ no—he should not eat . he was not hungry ; it would only make him hotter. ” in two minutes , however , he relented in his own favour ; and muttering something about spruce-beer , walked off . emma returned all her attention to her father , saying in secret—
austen	emma	the next question was— “ what sort of looking man is mr. martin ? ” “ oh ! not handsome—not at all handsome . i thought him very plain at first , but i do not think him so plain now . one does not , you know , after a time . but did you never see him ? he is in highbury every now and then , and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to kingston . he has passed you very often . ”
austen	emma	the first error and the worst lay at her door . it was foolish , it was wrong , to take so active a part in bringing any two people together . it was adventuring too far , assuming too much , making light of what ought to be serious , a trick of what ought to be simple . she was quite concerned and ashamed , and resolved to do such things no more .
austen	emma	“ well , ” said the still waiting harriet ; — “ well—and—and what shall i do ? ” “ what shall you do ! in what respect ? do you mean with regard to this letter ? ” “ yes. ” “ but what are you in doubt of ? you must answer it of course—and speedily . ”
austen	emma	her father ’ s business was to announce james ’ s being gone out to put the horses to , preparatory to their now daily drive to randalls ; and she had , therefore , an immediate excuse for disappearing .
austen	emma	“ you are extremely kind , ” said jane ; “ but i can not give up my early walk . i am advised to be out of doors as much as i can , i must walk somewhere , and the post-office is an object ; and upon my word , i have scarcely ever had a bad morning before . ”
austen	emma	these were the ladies whom emma found herself very frequently able to collect ; and happy was she , for her father ’ s sake , in the power ; though , as far as she was herself concerned , it was no remedy for the absence of mrs. weston . she was delighted to see her father look comfortable , and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well ; but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated .
austen	emma	emma doubted the truth of this sentiment . she had a great idea that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the extensive grounds of any body else ; but it was not worth while to attack an error so double-dyed , and therefore only said in reply ,
austen	emma	“ mr . knightley i declare ! —i must speak to him if possible , just to thank him . i will not open the window here ; it would give you all cold ; but i can go into my mother ’ s room you know . i dare say he will come in when he knows who is here . quite delightful to have you all meet so ! —our little room so honoured ! ”
austen	emma	“ mr . weston will be almost as much relieved as myself , ” said she . “ on this point we have been wretched . it was our darling wish that you might be attached to each other—and we were persuaded that it was so.— imagine what we have been feeling on your account . ”
austen	emma	but ah ! united , what reverse we have ! man ’ s boasted power and freedom , all are flown ; lord of the earth and sea , he bends a slave , and woman , lovely woman , reigns alone .
austen	emma	“ emma , my love , you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy ; but i am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected . his situation is an evil—but you must consider it as what satisfies your friend ; and i will answer for your thinking better and better of him as you know him more . his good sense and good principles would delight you.—as far as the man is concerned , you could not wish your friend in better hands . his rank in society i would alter if i could , which is saying a great deal i assure you , emma.—you laugh at me about william larkins ; but i could quite as ill spare robert martin . ”
austen	emma	emma was extremely confused . she could not endure to give him the true explanation ; for though her suspicions were by no means removed , she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them .
austen	emma	“ when i have seen mr. elton , ” replied jane , “ i dare say i shall be interested—but i believe it requires _that_ with me . and as it is some months since miss campbell married , the impression may be a little worn off . ”
austen	emma	mr. knightley , a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty , was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family , but particularly connected with it , as the elder brother of isabella ’ s husband . he lived about a mile from highbury , was a frequent visitor , and always welcome , and at this time more welcome than usual , as coming directly from their mutual connexions in london . he had returned to a late dinner , after some days ’ absence , and now walked up to hartfield to say that all were well in brunswick square . it was a happy circumstance , and animated mr. woodhouse for some time . mr. knightley had a cheerful manner , which always did him good ; and his many inquiries after “ poor isabella ” and her children were answered most satisfactorily . when this was over , mr. woodhouse gratefully observed , “ it is very kind of you , mr. knightley , to come out at this late hour to call upon us . i am afraid you must have had a shocking walk . ”
austen	emma	“ certainly . this moment , if you please . it is impossible to refuse what you ask in such a way . but what can be the matter ? —is she really not ill ? ” “ depend upon me—but ask no more questions . you will know it all in time . the most unaccountable business ! but hush , hush ! ”
austen	emma	“ if you were never particularly struck by her manners before , ” said she , “ i think you will to-day . you will see her to advantage ; see her and hear her—no , i am afraid you will not hear her at all , for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue . ”
austen	emma	“ by the bye—i have not wished you joy . being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling , i have been in no hurry with my congratulations ; but i hope it all went off tolerably well . how did you all behave ? who cried most ? ”
austen	emma	“ me ! ” cried harriet , colouring , and astonished . “ why should you caution me ? —you do not think i care about mr. frank churchill. ” “ i am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject , ” replied emma , smiling ; “ but you do not mean to deny that there was a time—and not very distant either—when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him ? ”
austen	emma	“ and do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such perfect secresy ? —the campbells , the dixons , did none of them know of the engagement ? ” emma could not speak the name of dixon without a little blush .
austen	emma	mr. woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls , and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in . “ so many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young—he wondered he could not remember them ! but he hoped he should in time. ” and it always ended in “ kitty , a fair but frozen maid . ”
austen	emma	“ no , i have not ; i know nothing ; pray tell me. ” “ you are prepared for the worst , i see—and very bad it is . harriet smith marries robert martin. ” emma gave a start , which did not seem like being prepared—and her eyes , in eager gaze , said , “ no , this is impossible ! ” but her lips were closed .
austen	emma	“ as a friend ! ” —repeated mr. knightley.— “ emma , that i fear is a word—no , i have no wish—stay , yes , why should i hesitate ? —i have gone too far already for concealment.—emma , i accept your offer—extraordinary as it may seem , i accept it , and refer myself to you as a friend.—tell me , then , have i no chance of ever succeeding ? ”
austen	emma	emma was almost too much astonished to answer ; but mrs. elton hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on . “ having understood as much , i was rather astonished to find her so very lady-like ! but she is really quite the gentlewoman . ”
austen	emma	had it been allowable entertainment , had there been no pain to her friend , or reproach to herself , in the waverings of harriet ’ s mind , emma would have been amused by its variations . sometimes mr. elton predominated , sometimes the martins ; and each was occasionally useful as a check to the other . mr. elton ’ s engagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting mr. martin . the unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by elizabeth martin ’ s calling at mrs. goddard ’ s a few days afterwards . harriet had not been at home ; but a note had been prepared and left for her , written in the very style to touch ; a small mixture of reproach , with a great deal of kindness ; and till mr. elton himself appeared , she had been much occupied by it , continually pondering over what could be done in return , and wishing to do more than she dared to confess . but mr. elton , in person , had driven away all such cares . while he staid , the martins were forgotten ; and on the very morning of his setting off for bath again , emma , to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned , judged it best for her to return elizabeth martin ’ s visit .
austen	emma	chapter ii mr. weston was a native of highbury , and born of a respectable family , which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property . he had received a good education , but , on succeeding early in life to a small independence , had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged , and had satisfied an active , cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county , then embodied .
austen	emma	“ her friends must all be sorry to lose her ; and will not colonel and mrs. campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their return ? ” “ yes ; jane says she is sure they will ; but yet , this is such a situation as she can not feel herself justified in declining . i was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying to mrs. elton , and when mrs. elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it ! it was before tea—stay—no , it could not be before tea , because we were just going to cards—and yet it was before tea , because i remember thinking—oh ! no , now i recollect , now i have it ; something happened before tea , but not that . mr. elton was called out of the room before tea , old john abdy ’ s son wanted to speak with him . poor old john , i have a great regard for him ; he was clerk to my poor father twenty-seven years ; and now , poor old man , he is bed-ridden , and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints—i must go and see him to-day ; and so will jane , i am sure , if she gets out at all . and poor john ’ s son came to talk to mr. elton about relief from the parish ; he is very well to do himself , you know , being head man at the crown , ostler , and every thing of that sort , but still he can not keep his father without some help ; and so , when mr. elton came back , he told us what john ostler had been telling him , and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to randalls to take mr. frank churchill to richmond . that was what happened before tea . it was after tea that jane spoke to mrs. elton . ”
austen	emma	“ me ! impossible ! ” “ indeed you did . i remember it perfectly . you mentioned it as what was certainly to be very soon . mrs. perry had told somebody , and was extremely happy about it . it was owing to _her_ persuasion , as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm . you must remember it now ? ”
austen	emma	“ miss fairfax , i suppose , though you were not aware of it , had been making up her mind the whole day ? ” “ i dare say she had. ” “ whenever the time may come , it must be unwelcome to her and all her friends—but i hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is possible—i mean , as to the character and manners of the family . ”
austen	emma	“ aye , i wonder which she will . poor little dears , how glad they will be to come . they are very fond of being at hartfield , harriet. ” “ i dare say they are , sir . i am sure i do not know who is not . ”
austen	emma	“ no , indeed , i shall grant you nothing . i always take the part of my own sex . i do indeed . i give you notice—you will find me a formidable antagonist on that point . i always stand up for women—and i assure you , if you knew how selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn , you would not wonder at mrs. churchill ’ s making incredible exertions to avoid it . selina says it is quite horror to her—and i believe i have caught a little of her nicety . she always travels with her own sheets ; an excellent precaution . does mrs. churchill do the same ? ”
austen	emma	emma wished she had been alone with mrs. weston . she should then have heard more : mrs. weston would speak to her , with a degree of unreserve which she would not hazard with isabella ; and , she really believed , would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the churchills from her , excepting those views on the young man , of which her own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge . but at present there was nothing more to be said . mr. woodhouse very soon followed them into the drawing-room . to be sitting long after dinner , was a confinement that he could not endure . neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him ; and gladly did he move to those with whom he was always comfortable .
austen	emma	the conversation was here interrupted . they were called on to share in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses , and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others ; but when the table was again safely covered , when every corner dish was placed exactly right , and occupation and ease were generally restored , emma said ,
austen	emma	emma began to listen better . “ i am to hear from him soon , ” continued mrs. weston . “ he told me at parting , that he should soon write ; and he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now . let us wait , therefore , for this letter . it may bring many extenuations . it may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be understood . don ’ t let us be severe , don ’ t let us be in a hurry to condemn him . let us have patience . i must love him ; and now that i am satisfied on one point , the one material point , i am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well , and ready to hope that it may . they must both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment . ”
austen	emma	“ i have not the least wish for it , i thank you. ” “ well—but if any difficulties should arise , my housekeeper is extremely clever. ” “ i will answer for it , that mine thinks herself full as clever , and would spurn any body ’ s assistance . ”
austen	emma	“ i shall soon bring him over to hartfield , ” said he , at the conclusion . emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech , from his wife . “ we had better move on , mr. weston , ” said she , “ we are detaining the girls . ”
austen	emma	“ middling , my dear ; i can not compliment you . i think mr. john knightley very far from looking well. ” “ what is the matter , sir ? —did you speak to me ? ” cried mr. john knightley , hearing his own name .
austen	emma	it was a more pressing concern to shew attention to jane fairfax , whose prospects were closing , while harriet ’ s opened , and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at highbury , who wished to shew her kindness—and with emma it was grown into a first wish . she had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness ; and the person , whom she had been so many months neglecting , was now the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy . she wanted to be of use to her ; wanted to shew a value for her society , and testify respect and consideration . she resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at hartfield . a note was written to urge it . the invitation was refused , and by a verbal message . “ miss fairfax was not well enough to write ; ” and when mr. perry called at hartfield , the same morning , it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited , though against her own consent , by himself , and that she was suffering under severe headaches , and a nervous fever to a degree , which made him doubt the possibility of her going to mrs. smallridge ’ s at the time proposed . her health seemed for the moment completely deranged—appetite quite gone—and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms , nothing touching the pulmonary complaint , which was the standing apprehension of the family , mr. perry was uneasy about her . he thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to , and that she felt it so herself , though she would not own it . her spirits seemed overcome . her present home , he could not but observe , was unfavourable to a nervous disorder : —confined always to one room ; —he could have wished it otherwise—and her good aunt , though his very old friend , he must acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description . her care and attention could not be questioned ; they were , in fact , only too great . he very much feared that miss fairfax derived more evil than good from them . emma listened with the warmest concern ; grieved for her more and more , and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful . to take her—be it only an hour or two—from her aunt , to give her change of air and scene , and quiet rational conversation , even for an hour or two , might do her good ; and the following morning she wrote again to say , in the most feeling language she could command , that she would call for her in the carriage at any hour that jane would name—mentioning that she had mr. perry ’ s decided opinion , in favour of such exercise for his patient . the answer was only in this short note :
austen	emma	emma knew that he was now getting to the box hill party , and grew uncomfortable . her own behaviour had been so very improper ! she was deeply ashamed , and a little afraid of his next look . it was all read , however , steadily , attentively , and without the smallest remark ; and , excepting one momentary glance at her , instantly withdrawn , in the fear of giving pain—no remembrance of box hill seemed to exist .
austen	emma	frank churchill seemed to have been on the watch ; and though he did not say much , his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening . they all walked about together , to see that every thing was as it should be ; and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another carriage , which emma could not hear the sound of at first , without great surprize . “ so unreasonably early ! ” she was going to exclaim ; but she presently found that it was a family of old friends , who were coming , like herself , by particular desire , to help mr. weston ’ s judgment ; and they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins , who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness , on the same errand , that it seemed as if half the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection .
austen	emma	one perplexity , however , arose , which the gentlemen did not disdain . it regarded a supper-room . at the time of the ballroom ’ s being built , suppers had not been in question ; and a small card-room adjoining , was the only addition . what was to be done ? this card-room would be wanted as a card-room now ; or , if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary by their four selves , still was it not too small for any comfortable supper ? another room of much better size might be secured for the purpose ; but it was at the other end of the house , and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it . this made a difficulty . mrs. weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage ; and neither emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded at supper .
austen	emma	she was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke , and opening the casement there , immediately called mr. knightley ’ s attention , and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others , as if it had passed within the same apartment .
austen	emma	“ are you expecting miss fairfax here soon ? ” “ oh yes ; next week. ” “ indeed ! —that must be a very great pleasure. ” “ thank you . you are very kind . yes , next week . every body is so surprized ; and every body says the same obliging things . i am sure she will be as happy to see her friends at highbury , as they can be to see her . yes , friday or saturday ; she can not say which , because colonel campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days . so very good of them to send her the whole way ! but they always do , you know . oh yes , friday or saturday next . that is what she writes about . that is the reason of her writing out of rule , as we call it ; for , in the common course , we should not have heard from her before next tuesday or wednesday . ”
austen	emma	“ thank you , thank you—but on no account.—i would rather walk.—and for _me_ to be afraid of walking alone ! —i , who may so soon have to guard others ! ” she spoke with great agitation ; and emma very feelingly replied , “ that can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now . i must order the carriage . the heat even would be danger.—you are fatigued already . ”
austen	emma	“ a very pleasant evening , ” he began , as soon as mr. woodhouse had been talked into what was necessary , told that he understood , and the papers swept away ; — “ particularly pleasant . you and miss fairfax gave us some very good music . i do not know a more luxurious state , sir , than sitting at one ’ s ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women ; sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation . i am sure miss fairfax must have found the evening pleasant , emma . you left nothing undone . i was glad you made her play so much , for having no instrument at her grandmother ’ s , it must have been a real indulgence . ”
austen	emma	“ and what are we to do for a proper partner for her ? ” said mr. weston . “ she will think frank ought to ask her. ” frank turned instantly to emma , to claim her former promise ; and boasted himself an engaged man , which his father looked his most perfect approbation of—and it then appeared that mrs. weston was wanting _him_ to dance with mrs. elton himself , and that their business was to help to persuade him into it , which was done pretty soon.—mr . weston and mrs. elton led the way , mr. frank churchill and miss woodhouse followed . emma must submit to stand second to mrs. elton , though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her . it was almost enough to make her think of marrying . mrs. elton had undoubtedly the advantage , at this time , in vanity completely gratified ; for though she had intended to begin with frank churchill , she could not lose by the change . mr. weston might be his son ’ s superior.—in spite of this little rub , however , emma was smiling with enjoyment , delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming , and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her.—she was more disturbed by mr. knightley ’ s not dancing than by any thing else.—there he was , among the standers-by , where he ought not to be ; he ought to be dancing , —not classing himself with the husbands , and fathers , and whist-players , who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made up , —so young as he looked ! —he could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere , than where he had placed himself . his tall , firm , upright figure , among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men , was such as emma felt must draw every body ’ s eyes ; and , excepting her own partner , there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him.—he moved a few steps nearer , and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner , with what natural grace , he must have danced , would he but take the trouble.—whenever she caught his eye , she forced him to smile ; but in general he was looking grave . she wished he could love a ballroom better , and could like frank churchill better.—he seemed often observing her . she must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing , but if he were criticising her behaviour , she did not feel afraid . there was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner . they seemed more like cheerful , easy friends , than lovers . that frank churchill thought less of her than he had done , was indubitable .
austen	emma	“ yes , very true . how nicely you talk ; i love to hear you . you understand every thing . you and mr. elton are one as clever as the other . this charade ! —if i had studied a twelvemonth , i could never have made any thing like it . ”
austen	emma	“ but she is so amusing , so extremely amusing ! i am very fond of hearing miss bates talk . and i need not bring the whole family , you know. ” here mr. weston joined them , and on hearing what was proposed , gave it his decided approbation .
austen	emma	“ just as it should be , ” said mr. john knightley , “ and just as i hoped it was from your letters . her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted , and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy . i have been always telling you , my love , that i had no idea of the change being so very material to hartfield as you apprehended ; and now you have emma ’ s account , i hope you will be satisfied . ”
austen	emma	the mention of the coles was sure to be followed by that of mr. elton . there was intimacy between them , and mr. cole had heard from mr. elton since his going away . emma knew what was coming ; they must have the letter over again , and settle how long he had been gone , and how much he was engaged in company , and what a favourite he was wherever he went , and how full the master of the ceremonies ’ ball had been ; and she went through it very well , with all the interest and all the commendation that could be requisite , and always putting forward to prevent harriet ’ s being obliged to say a word .
austen	emma	“ and you have forgotten one matter of joy to me , ” said emma , “ and a very considerable one—that i made the match myself . i made the match , you know , four years ago ; and to have it take place , and be proved in the right , when so many people said mr. weston would never marry again , may comfort me for any thing . ”
austen	emma	“ i dare say your apologies were accepted , sir . mr. elton knows you. ” “ yes : but a young lady—a bride—i ought to have paid my respects to her if possible . it was being very deficient . ”
austen	emma	“ i see how it is , ” said she . “ i see what a life i am to lead among you . upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated . we really seem quite the fashion . if this is living in the country , it is nothing very formidable . from monday next to saturday , i assure you we have not a disengaged day ! —a woman with fewer resources than i have , need not have been at a loss . ”
austen	emma	“ why , pretty well , my dear , upon the whole . but poor mrs. bates had a bad cold about a month ago. ” “ how sorry i am ! but colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn . mr. wingfield told me that he has never known them more general or heavy—except when it has been quite an influenza . ”
austen	emma	“ as soon as my aunt gets well , i shall go abroad , ” said he . “ i shall never be easy till i have seen some of these places . you will have my sketches , some time or other , to look at—or my tour to read—or my poem . i shall do something to expose myself . ”
austen	emma	“ what did mr. weston tell you ? ” —said emma , still perplexed . “ oh ! he told me all about it ; that jane fairfax and mr. frank churchill are to be married , and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while . how very odd ! ”
austen	emma	“ do you dare say this ? ” cried mr. knightley . “ do you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead , as not to know what a man is talking of ? —what do you deserve ? ”
austen	emma	“ encouragement ! —i give you encouragement ! —sir , you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it . i have seen you only as the admirer of my friend . in no other light could you have been more to me than a common acquaintance . i am exceedingly sorry : but it is well that the mistake ends where it does . had the same behaviour continued , miss smith might have been led into a misconception of your views ; not being aware , probably , any more than myself , of the very great inequality which you are so sensible of . but , as it is , the disappointment is single , and , i trust , will not be lasting . i have no thoughts of matrimony at present . ”
austen	emma	“ i know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind ; but excuse me , mr. knightley , if i take the liberty ( i consider myself , you know , as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that emma ’ s mother might have had ) the liberty of hinting that i do not think any possible good can arise from harriet smith ’ s intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you . pray excuse me ; but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy , it can not be expected that emma , accountable to nobody but her father , who perfectly approves the acquaintance , should put an end to it , so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself . it has been so many years my province to give advice , that you can not be surprized , mr. knightley , at this little remains of office . ”
austen	emma	they walked together . he was silent . she thought he was often looking at her , and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to give . and this belief produced another dread . perhaps he wanted to speak to her , of his attachment to harriet ; he might be watching for encouragement to begin.—she did not , could not , feel equal to lead the way to any such subject . he must do it all himself . yet she could not bear this silence . with him it was most unnatural . she considered—resolved—and , trying to smile , began—
austen	emma	the quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again ; and miss smith receiving her summons , was with her without delay , and unattended by any alarming young man . she came solitarily down the gravel walk—a miss martin just appearing at the door , and parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility .
austen	emma	“ who shall answer that question ? ” cried emma . “ my father would say ‘ yes , ’ mr. knightley ‘ no ; ’ and miss bates and i that he is just the happy medium . when you have been here a little longer , miss fairfax , you will understand that mr. elton is the standard of perfection in highbury , both in person and mind . ”
austen	emma	“ i am glad you think so ; and the good hands , i hope , may not be wanting. ” “ come , ” said he , “ you are anxious for a compliment , so i will tell you that you have improved her . you have cured her of her school-girl ’ s giggle ; she really does you credit . ”
austen	emma	“ upon my word , ” she cried , “ the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking . he will connect himself well if he can. ” “ will you read the letter ? ” cried harriet . “ pray do . ii ’ d rather you would . ”
austen	emma	“ very beautiful , indeed , ” replied emma ; and she spoke so kindly , that he gratefully burst out , “ how delighted i am to see you again ! and to see you in such excellent looks ! —i would not have missed this meeting for the world . i should certainly have called at hartfield , had you failed to come . ”
austen	emma	“ oh ! no . you are very obliging to say such things—but certainly not . there is no comparison between them . miss campbell always was absolutely plain—but extremely elegant and amiable. ” “ yes , that of course . ”
austen	emma	“ thank you , thank you.—this is just what i wanted to be assured of.—oh ! if you knew how much i love every thing that is decided and open ! —good-bye , good-bye. ” chapter xvii
austen	emma	mr. elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea , and was repeating , “ no husbands and wives in the case at present indeed , as you observe . exactly so . no husbands and wives , ” with so interesting a consciousness , that emma began to consider whether she had not better leave them together at once . but as she wanted to be drawing , the declaration must wait a little longer .
austen	emma	“ only think ! well , that must be infinitely provoking ! i have quite a horror of upstarts . maple grove has given me a thorough disgust to people of that sort ; for there is a family in that neighbourhood who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give themselves ! your description of mrs. churchill made me think of them directly . people of the name of tupman , very lately settled there , and encumbered with many low connexions , but giving themselves immense airs , and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families . a year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at west hall ; and how they got their fortune nobody knows . they came from birmingham , which is not a place to promise much , you know , mr. weston . one has not great hopes from birmingham . i always say there is something direful in the sound : but nothing more is positively known of the tupmans , though a good many things i assure you are suspected ; and yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my brother , mr. suckling , who happens to be one of their nearest neighbours . it is infinitely too bad . mr. suckling , who has been eleven years a resident at maple grove , and whose father had it before him—i believe , at least—i am almost sure that old mr. suckling had completed the purchase before his death . ”
austen	emma	“ upon my word it is , miss bates.—he really is engaged from morning to night.—there is no end of people ’ s coming to him , on some pretence or other.—the magistrates , and overseers , and churchwardens , are always wanting his opinion . they seem not able to do any thing without him.— ‘ upon my word , mr. e. , ’ i often say , ‘ rather you than i.—i do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument , if i had half so many applicants. ’ —bad enough as it is , for i absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree.—i believe i have not played a bar this fortnight.—however , he is coming , i assure you : yes , indeed , on purpose to wait on you all. ” and putting up her hand to screen her words from emma— “ a congratulatory visit , you know.—oh ! yes , quite indispensable . ”
austen	emma	“ well , miss woodhouse ! ” cried harriet , coming eagerly into the room— “ is not this the oddest news that ever was ? ” “ what news do you mean ? ” replied emma , unable to guess , by look or voice , whether harriet could indeed have received any hint .
austen	emma	in the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father ; not always listening , but always agreeing to what he said ; and , whether in speech or silence , conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being obliged to go to randalls every day , or poor mrs. weston would be disappointed .
austen	emma	how harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts to mr. knightley ! —how she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it ! —but harriet was less humble , had fewer scruples than formerly.—her inferiority , whether of mind or situation , seemed little felt.—she had seemed more sensible of mr. elton ’ s being to stoop in marrying her , than she now seemed of mr. knightley ’ s.—alas ! was not that her own doing too ? who had been at pains to give harriet notions of self-consequence but herself ? —who but herself had taught her , that she was to elevate herself if possible , and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment ? —if harriet , from being humble , were grown vain , it was her doing too .
austen	emma	“ but you would not wish me to come away before i am tired , papa ? ” “ oh ! no , my love ; but you will soon be tired . there will be a great many people talking at once . you will not like the noise . ”
austen	emma	it was now some time since miss taylor had begun to influence his schemes ; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth , it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase randalls , and the sale of randalls was long looked forward to ; but he had gone steadily on , with these objects in view , till they were accomplished . he had made his fortune , bought his house , and obtained his wife ; and was beginning a new period of existence , with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through . he had never been an unhappy man ; his own temper had secured him from that , even in his first marriage ; but his second must shew him how delightful a well-judging and truly amiable woman could be , and must give him the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen , to excite gratitude than to feel it .
austen	emma	“ oh ! miss woodhouse , how you do forget ! ” “ my dear harriet , i perfectly remember the substance of what i said on the occasion . i told you that i did not wonder at your attachment ; that considering the service he had rendered you , it was extremely natural : —and you agreed to it , expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service , and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue.—the impression of it is strong on my memory . ”
austen	emma	“ we were too magnificent , ” said he . “ we allowed unnecessary room . ten couple may stand here very well. ” emma demurred . “ it would be a crowd—a sad crowd ; and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in ? ”
austen	emma	“ harriet ! ” cried emma , collecting herself resolutely— “ let us understand each other now , without the possibility of farther mistake . are you speaking of—mr . knightley ? ” “ to be sure i am . i never could have an idea of any body else—and so i thought you knew . when we talked about him , it was as clear as possible . ”
austen	emma	“ is not she looking well ? ” said he , turning his eyes towards jane . “ better than she ever used to do ? —you see how my father and mrs. weston doat upon her. ” but his spirits were soon rising again , and with laughing eyes , after mentioning the expected return of the campbells , he named the name of dixon.—emma blushed , and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing .
austen	emma	“ thank you , thank you , my own sweet little friend . we will not be parted . a woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked , or because he is attached to her , and can write a tolerable letter . ”
austen	emma	“ leave it to me . you do nothing . he will be here this evening , i dare say , and then i will give it him back , and some nonsense or other will pass between us , and you shall not be committed.—your soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming . trust to me . ”
austen	emma	“ well , miss woodhouse , ” said harriet , when they had quitted the house , and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin ; “ well , miss woodhouse , ( with a gentle sigh , ) what do you think of her ? —is not she very charming ? ”
austen	emma	“ upon my honour , ” said he very seriously , “ it does not . it is not in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of knightley. ” emma ’ s courage returned , and she walked on .
austen	emma	emma understood him ; and as soon as she could recover from the flutter of pleasure , excited by such tender consideration , replied , “ you are very kind—but you are mistaken—and i must set you right.— i am not in want of that sort of compassion . my blindness to what was going on , led me to act by them in a way that i must always be ashamed of , and i was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures , but i have no other reason to regret that i was not in the secret earlier . ”
austen	emma	“ no , ” —he calmly replied , — “ there is but one married woman in the world whom i can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to donwell , and that one is— ” “ —mrs . weston , i suppose , ” interrupted mrs. elton , rather mortified .
austen	emma	“ it is unfortunate that they can not stay longer—but it seems a case of necessity . mr. john knightley must be in town again on the 28th , and we ought to be thankful , papa , that we are to have the whole of the time they can give to the country , that two or three days are not to be taken out for the abbey . mr. knightley promises to give up his claim this christmas—though you know it is longer since they were with him , than with us . ”
austen	emma	“ not harriet ’ s equal ! ” exclaimed mr. knightley loudly and warmly ; and with calmer asperity , added , a few moments afterwards , “ no , he is not her equal indeed , for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation . emma , your infatuation about that girl blinds you . what are harriet smith ’ s claims , either of birth , nature or education , to any connexion higher than robert martin ? she is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom , with probably no settled provision at all , and certainly no respectable relations . she is known only as parlour-boarder at a common school . she is not a sensible girl , nor a girl of any information . she has been taught nothing useful , and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself . at her age she can have no experience , and with her little wit , is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her . she is pretty , and she is good tempered , and that is all . my only scruple in advising the match was on his account , as being beneath his deserts , and a bad connexion for him . i felt that , as to fortune , in all probability he might do much better ; and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate , he could not do worse . but i could not reason so to a man in love , and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her , to her having that sort of disposition , which , in good hands , like his , might be easily led aright and turn out very well . the advantage of the match i felt to be all on her side ; and had not the smallest doubt ( nor have i now ) that there would be a general cry-out upon her extreme good luck . even _your_ satisfaction i made sure of . it crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend ’ s leaving highbury , for the sake of her being settled so well . i remember saying to myself , ‘ even emma , with all her partiality for harriet , will think this a good match . ’ ”
austen	emma	seldom , very seldom , does complete truth belong to any human disclosure ; seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised , or a little mistaken ; but where , as in this case , though the conduct is mistaken , the feelings are not , it may not be very material.—mr . knightley could not impute to emma a more relenting heart than she possessed , or a heart more disposed to accept of his .
austen	emma	“ yes , ” said his brother quickly , “ it is randalls that does it all. ” “ very well—and as randalls , i suppose , is not likely to have less influence than heretofore , it strikes me as a possible thing , emma , that henry and john may be sometimes in the way . and if they are , i only beg you to send them home . ”
austen	emma	“ my dear emma , i have told you what led me to think of it . i do not want the match—i do not want to injure dear little henry—but the idea has been given me by circumstances ; and if mr. knightley really wished to marry , you would not have him refrain on henry ’ s account , a boy of six years old , who knows nothing of the matter ? ”
austen	emma	“ but i do not see why poor isabella should be obliged to go back so soon , though he does . i think , emma , i shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us . she and the children might stay very well . ”
austen	emma	“ i will say no more about him , ” cried emma , “ you turn every thing to evil . we are both prejudiced ; you against , i for him ; and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here . ”
austen	emma	“ i have known her from a child , undoubtedly ; we have been children and women together ; and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate , —that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends . but we never did . i hardly know how it has happened ; a little , perhaps , from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was , by her aunt and grandmother , and all their set . and then , her reserve—i never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved . ”
austen	emma	“ what is the matter ? ” said she . he started . “ thank you for rousing me , ” he replied . “ i believe i have been very rude ; but really miss fairfax has done her hair in so odd a way—so very odd a way—that i can not keep my eyes from her . i never saw any thing so outrée ! —those curls ! —this must be a fancy of her own . i see nobody else looking like her ! —i must go and ask her whether it is an irish fashion . shall i ? —yes , i will—i declare i will—and you shall see how she takes it ; —whether she colours . ”
austen	emma	as she sat one morning , looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day , a note was brought from mrs. goddard , requesting , in most respectful terms , to be allowed to bring miss smith with her ; a most welcome request : for miss smith was a girl of seventeen , whom emma knew very well by sight , and had long felt an interest in , on account of her beauty . a very gracious invitation was returned , and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion .
austen	emma	“ i never saw any gentleman ’ s handwriting ” —emma began , looking also at mrs. weston ; but stopped , on perceiving that mrs. weston was attending to some one else—and the pause gave her time to reflect , “ now , how am i going to introduce him ? —am i unequal to speaking his name at once before all these people ? is it necessary for me to use any roundabout phrase ? —your yorkshire friend—your correspondent in yorkshire ; —that would be the way , i suppose , if i were very bad.—no , i can pronounce his name without the smallest distress . i certainly get better and better.—now for it . ”
austen	emma	“ you are not quite so miserable , though , as when you first came . go and eat and drink a little more , and you will do very well . another slice of cold meat , another draught of madeira and water , will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us . ”
austen	emma	the evening of this day was very long , and melancholy , at hartfield . the weather added what it could of gloom . a cold stormy rain set in , and nothing of july appeared but in the trees and shrubs , which the wind was despoiling , and the length of the day , which only made such cruel sights the longer visible .
austen	emma	captain weston , who had been considered , especially by the churchills , as making such an amazing match , was proved to have much the worst of the bargain ; for when his wife died , after a three years ’ marriage , he was rather a poorer man than at first , and with a child to maintain . from the expense of the child , however , he was soon relieved . the boy had , with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mother ’ s , been the means of a sort of reconciliation ; and mr. and mrs. churchill , having no children of their own , nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for , offered to take the whole charge of the little frank soon after her decease . some scruples and some reluctance the widower-father may be supposed to have felt ; but as they were overcome by other considerations , the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the churchills , and he had only his own comfort to seek , and his own situation to improve as he could .

austen	emma	“ what was i talking of ? ” said she , beginning again when they were all in the street . emma wondered on what , of all the medley , she would fix . “ i declare i can not recollect what i was talking of.—oh ! my mother ’ s spectacles . so very obliging of mr. frank churchill ! ‘ oh ! ’ said he , ‘ i do think i can fasten the rivet ; i like a job of this kind excessively. ’ —which you know shewed him to be so very .... indeed i must say that , much as i had heard of him before and much as i had expected , he very far exceeds any thing .... i do congratulate you , mrs. weston , most warmly . he seems every thing the fondest parent could .... ‘ oh ! ’ said he , ‘ i can fasten the rivet . i like a job of that sort excessively. ’ i never shall forget his manner . and when i brought out the baked apples from the closet , and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some , ‘ oh ! ’ said he directly , ‘ there is nothing in the way of fruit half so good , and these are the finest-looking home-baked apples i ever saw in my life. ’ that , you know , was so very .... and i am sure , by his manner , it was no compliment . indeed they are very delightful apples , and mrs. wallis does them full justice—only we do not have them baked more than twice , and mr. woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times—but miss woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it . the apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking , beyond a doubt ; all from donwell—some of mr. knightley ’ s most liberal supply . he sends us a sack every year ; and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees—i believe there is two of them . my mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days . but i was really quite shocked the other day—for mr. knightley called one morning , and jane was eating these apples , and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them , and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock . ‘ i am sure you must be , ’ said he , ‘ and i will send you another supply ; for i have a great many more than i can ever use . william larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year . i will send you some more , before they get good for nothing. ’ so i begged he would not—for really as to ours being gone , i could not absolutely say that we had a great many left—it was but half a dozen indeed ; but they should be all kept for jane ; and i could not at all bear that he should be sending us more , so liberal as he had been already ; and jane said the same . and when he was gone , she almost quarrelled with me—no , i should not say quarrelled , for we never had a quarrel in our lives ; but she was quite distressed that i had owned the apples were so nearly gone ; she wished i had made him believe we had a great many left . oh , said i , my dear , i did say as much as i could . however , the very same evening william larkins came over with a large basket of apples , the same sort of apples , a bushel at least , and i was very much obliged , and went down and spoke to william larkins and said every thing , as you may suppose . william larkins is such an old acquaintance ! i am always glad to see him . but , however , i found afterwards from patty , that william said it was all the apples of _that_ sort his master had ; he had brought them all—and now his master had not one left to bake or boil . william did not seem to mind it himself , he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many ; for william , you know , thinks more of his master ’ s profit than any thing ; but mrs. hodges , he said , was quite displeased at their being all sent away . she could not bear that her master should not be able to have another apple-tart this spring . he told patty this , but bid her not mind it , and be sure not to say any thing to us about it , for mrs. hodges _would_ be cross sometimes , and as long as so many sacks were sold , it did not signify who ate the remainder . and so patty told me , and i was excessively shocked indeed ! i would not have mr. knightley know any thing about it for the world ! he would be so very .... i wanted to keep it from jane ’ s knowledge ; but , unluckily , i had mentioned it before i was aware . ”
austen	emma	emma then looked up , and immediately saw how it was ; and after a moment ’ s debate , as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not , replied , “ never marry ! —this is a new resolution . ”
austen	emma	“ oh ! as for me , my judgment is worth nothing . where i have a regard , i always think a person well-looking . but i gave what i believed the general opinion , when i called him plain . ”
austen	emma	“ oh ! good mr. perry—how is he , sir ? ” “ why , pretty well ; but not quite well . poor perry is bilious , and he has not time to take care of himself—he tells me he has not time to take care of himself—which is very sad—but he is always wanted all round the country . i suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere . but then there is not so clever a man any where . ”
austen	emma	harriet certainly was not clever , but she had a sweet , docile , grateful disposition , was totally free from conceit , and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to . her early attachment to herself was very amiable ; and her inclination for good company , and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever , shewed that there was no want of taste , though strength of understanding must not be expected . altogether she was quite convinced of harriet smith ’ s being exactly the young friend she wanted—exactly the something which her home required . such a friend as mrs. weston was out of the question . two such could never be granted . two such she did not want . it was quite a different sort of thing , a sentiment distinct and independent . mrs. weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem . harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful . for mrs. weston there was nothing to be done ; for harriet every thing .
austen	emma	“ indeed ! how so ? of what sort ? ” “ a very serious sort , i assure you ; ” still smiling . “ very serious ! i can think of but one thing—who is in love with her ? who makes you their confidant ? ”
austen	emma	“ yes—it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour of mrs. churchill , which i imagine to be the most certain thing in the world. ” “ my emma ! ” replied mrs. weston , smiling , “ what is the certainty of caprice ? ” then turning to isabella , who had not been attending before— “ you must know , my dear mrs. knightley , that we are by no means so sure of seeing mr. frank churchill , in my opinion , as his father thinks . it depends entirely upon his aunt ’ s spirits and pleasure ; in short , upon her temper . to you—to my two daughters—i may venture on the truth . mrs. churchill rules at enscombe , and is a very odd-tempered woman ; and his coming now , depends upon her being willing to spare him . ”
austen	emma	as for mr. elton , his manners did not appear—but no , she would not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners . it was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits , and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it . the woman was better off ; she might have the assistance of fine clothes , and the privilege of bashfulness , but the man had only his own good sense to depend on ; and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor mr. elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just married , the woman he had wanted to marry , and the woman whom he had been expected to marry , she must allow him to have the right to look as little wise , and to be as much affectedly , and as little really easy as could be .
austen	emma	“ that may be , and i may have seen him fifty times , but without having any idea of his name . a young farmer , whether on horseback or on foot , is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity . the yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom i feel i can have nothing to do . a degree or two lower , and a creditable appearance might interest me ; i might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other . but a farmer can need none of my help , and is , therefore , in one sense , as much above my notice as in every other he is below it . ”
austen	emma	this was the only visit from frank churchill in the course of ten days . he was often hoping , intending to come—but was always prevented . his aunt could not bear to have him leave her . such was his own account at randall ’ s . if he were quite sincere , if he really tried to come , it was to be inferred that mrs. churchill ’ s removal to london had been of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder . that she was really ill was very certain ; he had declared himself convinced of it , at randalls . though much might be fancy , he could not doubt , when he looked back , that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been half a year ago . he did not believe it to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove , or at least that she might not have many years of existence before her ; but he could not be prevailed on , by all his father ’ s doubts , to say that her complaints were merely imaginary , or that she was as strong as ever .
austen	emma	mr. knightley shook his head at her . her father fondly replied , “ ah ! my dear , i wish you would not make matches and foretell things , for whatever you say always comes to pass . pray do not make any more matches . ”
austen	emma	“ if i did not know her to be happy now , ” said emma , seriously , “ which , in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience , she must be , i could not bear these thanks ; —for , oh ! mrs. weston , if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good i have done miss fairfax ! —well ( checking herself , and trying to be more lively ) , this is all to be forgotten . you are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars . they shew her to the greatest advantage . i am sure she is very good—i hope she will be very happy . it is fit that the fortune should be on his side , for i think the merit will be all on hers . ”
austen	emma	“ highbury gossips ! —tiresome wretches ! ” “ harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would. ” emma knew this was too true for contradiction , and therefore said nothing . he presently added , with a smile ,
austen	emma	“ that will do , ” said he , when it was finished , thinking aloud— “ you have sung quite enough for one evening—now be quiet. ” another song , however , was soon begged for . “ one more ; —they would not fatigue miss fairfax on any account , and would only ask for one more. ” and frank churchill was heard to say , “ i think you could manage this without effort ; the first part is so very trifling . the strength of the song falls on the second . ”
austen	emma	“ brother and sister ! no , indeed. ” chapter iii this little explanation with mr. knightley gave emma considerable pleasure . it was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball , which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.—she was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the eltons , and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike ; and his praise of harriet , his concession in her favour , was peculiarly gratifying . the impertinence of the eltons , which for a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening , had been the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions ; and she looked forward to another happy result—the cure of harriet ’ s infatuation.—from harriet ’ s manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the ballroom , she had strong hopes . it seemed as if her eyes were suddenly opened , and she were enabled to see that mr. elton was not the superior creature she had believed him . the fever was over , and emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious courtesy . she depended on the evil feelings of the eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther requisite.—harriet rational , frank churchill not too much in love , and mr. knightley not wanting to quarrel with her , how very happy a summer must be before her !
austen	emma	harriet had not surmised her own danger , but the idea of it struck her forcibly . “ you could not have visited me ! ” she cried , looking aghast . “ no , to be sure you could not ; but i never thought of that before . that would have been too dreadful ! —what an escape ! —dear miss woodhouse , i would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world . ”
austen	emma	emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly . in all probability she was at this very time waited for there ; and mr. knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards mr. elton , if not towards william larkins .
austen	emma	chapter viii frank churchill came back again ; and if he kept his father ’ s dinner waiting , it was not known at hartfield ; for mrs. weston was too anxious for his being a favourite with mr. woodhouse , to betray any imperfection which could be concealed .
austen	emma	mrs. weston , kind-hearted and musical , was particularly interested by the circumstance , and emma could not help being amused at her perseverance in dwelling on the subject ; and having so much to ask and to say as to tone , touch , and pedal , totally unsuspicious of that wish of saying as little about it as possible , which she plainly read in the fair heroine ’ s countenance .
austen	emma	the others had been talking of the child , mrs. weston giving an account of a little alarm she had been under , the evening before , from the infant ’ s appearing not quite well . she believed she had been foolish , but it had alarmed her , and she had been within half a minute of sending for mr. perry . perhaps she ought to be ashamed , but mr. weston had been almost as uneasy as herself.—in ten minutes , however , the child had been perfectly well again . this was her history ; and particularly interesting it was to mr. woodhouse , who commended her very much for thinking of sending for perry , and only regretted that she had not done it . “ she should always send for perry , if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered , were it only for a moment . she could not be too soon alarmed , nor send for perry too often . it was a pity , perhaps , that he had not come last night ; for , though the child seemed well now , very well considering , it would probably have been better if perry had seen it . ”
austen	emma	“ to be sure , ” said harriet , in a mortified voice , “ he is not so genteel as real gentlemen. ” “ i think , harriet , since your acquaintance with us , you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen , that you must yourself be struck with the difference in mr. martin . at hartfield , you have had very good specimens of well educated , well bred men . i should be surprized if , after seeing them , you could be in company with mr. martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creature—and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before . do not you begin to feel that now ? were not you struck ? i am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner , and the uncouthness of a voice which i heard to be wholly unmodulated as i stood here . ”
austen	emma	the evil of the actual disparity in their ages ( and mr. woodhouse had not married early ) was much increased by his constitution and habits ; for having been a valetudinarian all his life , without activity of mind or body , he was a much older man in ways than in years ; and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper , his talents could not have recommended him at any time .
austen	emma	on the subject of the first of the two circumstances , she did , after a little reflection , venture the following question . “ might he not ? —is not it possible , that when enquiring , as you thought , into the state of your affections , he might be alluding to mr. martin—he might have mr. martin ’ s interest in view ? but harriet rejected the suspicion with spirit .
austen	emma	“ oh ! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us ; thank you for the sight of it . we admired it so much , that i have ventured to write it into miss smith ’ s collection . your friend will not take it amiss i hope . of course i have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines . ”
austen	emma	“ then it would not be so strong a sense . if it failed to produce equal exertion , it could not be an equal conviction. ” “ oh , the difference of situation and habit ! i wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those , whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life . ”
austen	emma	“ depend upon it , emma , a sensible man would find no difficulty in it . he would feel himself in the right ; and the declaration—made , of course , as a man of sense would make it , in a proper manner—would do him more good , raise him higher , fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on , than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do . respect would be added to affection . they would feel that they could trust him ; that the nephew who had done rightly by his father , would do rightly by them ; for they know , as well as he does , as well as all the world must know , that he ought to pay this visit to his father ; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it , are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims . respect for right conduct is felt by every body . if he would act in this sort of manner , on principle , consistently , regularly , their little minds would bend to his . ”
austen	emma	“ oh ! that ’ s all . i have nothing more to shew you , or to say—except that i am now going to throw them both behind the fire , and i wish you to see me do it . ”
austen	emma	“ this present from the campbells , ” said she— “ this pianoforte is very kindly given. ” “ yes , ” he replied , and without the smallest apparent embarrassment.— “ but they would have done better had they given her notice of it . surprizes are foolish things . the pleasure is not enhanced , and the inconvenience is often considerable . i should have expected better judgment in colonel campbell . ”
austen	emma	she was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in miss smith ’ s conversation , but she found her altogether very engaging—not inconveniently shy , not unwilling to talk—and yet so far from pushing , shewing so proper and becoming a deference , seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to hartfield , and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to , that she must have good sense , and deserve encouragement . encouragement should be given . those soft blue eyes , and all those natural graces , should not be wasted on the inferior society of highbury and its connexions . the acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her . the friends from whom she had just parted , though very good sort of people , must be doing her harm . they were a family of the name of martin , whom emma well knew by character , as renting a large farm of mr. knightley , and residing in the parish of donwell—very creditably , she believed—she knew mr. knightley thought highly of them—but they must be coarse and unpolished , and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect . _she_ would notice her ; she would improve her ; she would detach her from her bad acquaintance , and introduce her into good society ; she would form her opinions and her manners . it would be an interesting , and certainly a very kind undertaking ; highly becoming her own situation in life , her leisure , and powers .
austen	emma	the time was coming when the news must spread farther , and other persons ’ reception of it tried . as soon as mrs. weston was sufficiently recovered to admit mr. woodhouse ’ s visits , emma having it in view that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause , resolved first to announce it at home , and then at randalls.—but how to break it to her father at last ! —she had bound herself to do it , in such an hour of mr. knightley ’ s absence , or when it came to the point her heart would have failed her , and she must have put it off ; but mr. knightley was to come at such a time , and follow up the beginning she was to make.—she was forced to speak , and to speak cheerfully too . she must not make it a more decided subject of misery to him , by a melancholy tone herself . she must not appear to think it a misfortune.—with all the spirits she could command , she prepared him first for something strange , and then , in a few words , said , that if his consent and approbation could be obtained—which , she trusted , would be attended with no difficulty , since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all—she and mr. knightley meant to marry ; by which means hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person ’ s company whom she knew he loved , next to his daughters and mrs. weston , best in the world .
austen	emma	such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by mrs. weston . she thought well of frank in almost every respect ; and , what was more , she loved him very much , and her defence was , therefore , earnest . she talked with a great deal of reason , and at least equal affection—but she had too much to urge for emma ’ s attention ; it was soon gone to brunswick square or to donwell ; she forgot to attempt to listen ; and when mrs. weston ended with , “ we have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for , you know , but i hope it will soon come , ” she was obliged to pause before she answered , and at last obliged to answer at random , before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for .
austen	emma	“ my dear , dear anxious friend , ” —said she , in mental soliloquy , while walking downstairs from her own room , “ always overcareful for every body ’ s comfort but your own ; i see you now in all your little fidgets , going again and again into his room , to be sure that all is right. ” the clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall . “ ’ tis twelve ; i shall not forget to think of you four hours hence ; and by this time to-morrow , perhaps , or a little later , i may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here . i am sure they will bring him soon . ”
austen	emma	“ me , my love , ” cried his wife , hearing and understanding only in part.— “ are you talking about me ? —i am sure nobody ought to be , or can be , a greater advocate for matrimony than i am ; and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving hartfield , i should never have thought of miss taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world ; and as to slighting mr. weston , that excellent mr. weston , i think there is nothing he does not deserve . i believe he is one of the very best-tempered men that ever existed . excepting yourself and your brother , i do not know his equal for temper . i shall never forget his flying henry ’ s kite for him that very windy day last easter—and ever since his particular kindness last september twelvemonth in writing that note , at twelve o ’ clock at night , on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at cobham , i have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence.—if any body can deserve him , it must be miss taylor . ”
austen	emma	some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings . he begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long , and which had been the home of his father ’ s father ; and on recollecting that an old woman who had nursed him was still living , walked in quest of her cottage from one end of the street to the other ; and though in some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit , they shewed , altogether , a good-will towards highbury in general , which must be very like a merit to those he was with .
austen	emma	“ not for the world , ” said emma , smiling graciously , “ would i advise you either way . you must be the best judge of your own happiness . if you prefer mr. martin to every other person ; if you think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with , why should you hesitate ? you blush , harriet.—does any body else occur to you at this moment under such a definition ? harriet , harriet , do not deceive yourself ; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion . at this moment whom are you thinking of ? ”
austen	emma	harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since those two decisive dances.—emma knew that he had , on that occasion , found her much superior to his expectation . from that evening , or at least from the time of miss woodhouse ’ s encouraging her to think of him , harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he had been used to do , and of his having indeed quite a different manner towards her ; a manner of kindness and sweetness ! —latterly she had been more and more aware of it . when they had been all walking together , he had so often come and walked by her , and talked so very delightfully ! —he seemed to want to be acquainted with her . emma knew it to have been very much the case . she had often observed the change , to almost the same extent.—harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him—and emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had known of his opinion of harriet . he praised her for being without art or affectation , for having simple , honest , generous , feelings.—she knew that he saw such recommendations in harriet ; he had dwelt on them to her more than once.—much that lived in harriet ’ s memory , many little particulars of the notice she had received from him , a look , a speech , a removal from one chair to another , a compliment implied , a preference inferred , had been unnoticed , because unsuspected , by emma . circumstances that might swell to half an hour ’ s relation , and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them , had passed undiscerned by her who now heard them ; but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned , the two of strongest promise to harriet , were not without some degree of witness from emma herself.—the first , was his walking with her apart from the others , in the lime-walk at donwell , where they had been walking some time before emma came , and he had taken pains ( as she was convinced ) to draw her from the rest to himself—and at first , he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done before , in a very particular way indeed ! — ( harriet could not recall it without a blush . ) he seemed to be almost asking her , whether her affections were engaged.—but as soon as she ( miss woodhouse ) appeared likely to join them , he changed the subject , and began talking about farming : —the second , was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour before emma came back from her visit , the very last morning of his being at hartfield—though , when he first came in , he had said that he could not stay five minutes—and his having told her , during their conversation , that though he must go to london , it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all , which was much more ( as emma felt ) than he had acknowledged to _her_ . the superior degree of confidence towards harriet , which this one article marked , gave her severe pain .
austen	emma	emma was quite at a loss . the tone implied some old acquaintance—and how could she possibly guess ? “ knightley ! ” continued mrs. elton ; “ knightley himself ! —was not it lucky ? —for , not being within when he called the other day , i had never seen him before ; and of course , as so particular a friend of mr. e. ’ s , i had a great curiosity . ‘ my friend knightley ’ had been so often mentioned , that i was really impatient to see him ; and i must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend . knightley is quite the gentleman . i like him very much . decidedly , i think , a very gentleman-like man . ”
austen	emma	“ the churchills are very likely in fault , ” said mr. knightley , coolly ; “ but i dare say he might come if he would. ” “ i do not know why you should say so . he wishes exceedingly to come ; but his uncle and aunt will not spare him . ”
austen	emma	“ it is a most repulsive quality , indeed , ” said he . “ oftentimes very convenient , no doubt , but never pleasing . there is safety in reserve , but no attraction . one can not love a reserved person . ”
austen	emma	“ but , in spite of all her friends ’ urgency , and her own wish of seeing ireland , miss fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and mrs. bates ? ” “ yes—entirely her own doing , entirely her own choice ; and colonel and mrs. campbell think she does quite right , just what they should recommend ; and indeed they particularly _wish_ her to try her native air , as she has not been quite so well as usual lately . ”
austen	emma	the intermediate month was the one fixed on , as far as they dared , by emma and mr. knightley.—they had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while john and isabella were still at hartfield , to allow them the fortnight ’ s absence in a tour to the seaside , which was the plan.—john and isabella , and every other friend , were agreed in approving it . but mr. woodhouse—how was mr. woodhouse to be induced to consent ? —he , who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a distant event .
austen	emma	one good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal , —the ball at the crown . it had not been forgotten before , but it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day . now , however , it was absolutely to be ; every preparation was resumed , and very soon after the churchills had removed to richmond , a few lines from frank , to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change , and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty-four hours at any given time , induced them to name as early a day as possible .
austen	emma	they were soon joined by some of the gentlemen ; and the very first of the early was frank churchill . in he walked , the first and the handsomest ; and after paying his compliments en passant to miss bates and her niece , made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle , where sat miss woodhouse ; and till he could find a seat by her , would not sit at all . emma divined what every body present must be thinking . she was his object , and every body must perceive it . she introduced him to her friend , miss smith , and , at convenient moments afterwards , heard what each thought of the other . “ he had never seen so lovely a face , and was delighted with her naïveté. ” and she , “ only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment , but she did think there were some looks a little like mr. elton. ” emma restrained her indignation , and only turned from her in silence .
austen	emma	emma found that it was not mr. weston ’ s fault that the number of privy councillors was not yet larger . they had stopped at mrs. bates ’ s door to offer the use of their carriage , but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the eltons .
austen	emma	“ as you do us such ample justice now , ” said emma , laughing , “ i will venture to ask , whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first ? do not we rather surpass your expectations ? i am sure we do . i am sure you did not much expect to like us . you would not have been so long in coming , if you had had a pleasant idea of highbury . ”
austen	emma	while he talked to isabella , however , emma found an opportunity of saying , “ and so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain . i am sorry for it . the introduction must be unpleasant , whenever it takes place ; and the sooner it could be over , the better . ”
austen	emma	to understand , thoroughly understand her own heart , was the first endeavour . to that point went every leisure moment which her father ’ s claims on her allowed , and every moment of involuntary absence of mind .
austen	emma	“ and , in return for your acknowledging so much , i will do you the justice to say , that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself.—harriet smith has some first-rate qualities , which mrs. elton is totally without . an unpretending , single-minded , artless girl—infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as mrs. elton . i found harriet more conversable than i expected . ”
austen	emma	chapter viii the wretchedness of a scheme to box hill was in emma ’ s thoughts all the evening . how it might be considered by the rest of the party , she could not tell . they , in their different homes , and their different ways , might be looking back on it with pleasure ; but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent , more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time , and more to be abhorred in recollection , than any she had ever passed . a whole evening of back-gammon with her father , was felicity to it . _there_ , indeed , lay real pleasure , for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty-four to his comfort ; and feeling that , unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and confiding esteem , she could not , in her general conduct , be open to any severe reproach . as a daughter , she hoped she was not without a heart . she hoped no one could have said to her , “ how could you be so unfeeling to your father ? —i must , i will tell you truths while i can. ” miss bates should never again—no , never ! if attention , in future , could do away the past , she might hope to be forgiven . she had been often remiss , her conscience told her so ; remiss , perhaps , more in thought than fact ; scornful , ungracious . but it should be so no more . in the warmth of true contrition , she would call upon her the very next morning , and it should be the beginning , on her side , of a regular , equal , kindly intercourse .
austen	emma	chapter xi mr. elton must now be left to himself . it was no longer in emma ’ s power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures . the coming of her sister ’ s family was so very near at hand , that first in anticipation , and then in reality , it became henceforth her prime object of interest ; and during the ten days of their stay at hartfield it was not to be expected—she did not herself expect—that any thing beyond occasional , fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers . they might advance rapidly if they would , however ; they must advance somehow or other whether they would or no . she hardly wished to have more leisure for them . there are people , who the more you do for them , the less they will do for themselves .
austen	emma	“ that ’ s easily said , and easily felt by you , who have always been your own master . you are the worst judge in the world , mr. knightley , of the difficulties of dependence . you do not know what it is to have tempers to manage . ”
austen	emma	“ there is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends , the eltons , ” was his next observation.— “ his feelings are natural.—what ! actually resolve to break with him entirely ! —she felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each—she dissolved it.—what a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour ! —well , he must be a most extraordinary— ”
austen	emma	they were permitted to go alone ; and with a cordial nod from one , and a graceful bow from the other , the two gentlemen took leave . emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance , and could now engage to think of them all at randalls any hour of the day , with full confidence in their comfort .
austen	emma	“ oh ! yes—she will have her own room , of course ; the room she always has ; —and there is the nursery for the children , —just as usual , you know . why should there be any change ? ”
austen	emma	“ how often , when you were a girl , have you said to me , with one of your saucy looks— ‘ mr . knightley , i am going to do so-and-so ; papa says i may , or i have miss taylor ’ s leave ’ —something which , you knew , i did not approve . in such cases my interference was giving you two bad feelings instead of one . ”
austen	emma	“ there is my news : —i thought it would interest you , ” said mr. knightley , with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what had passed between them . “ but where could _you_ hear it ? ” cried miss bates . “ where could you possibly hear it , mr. knightley ? for it is not five minutes since i received mrs. cole ’ s note—no , it can not be more than five—or at least ten—for i had got my bonnet and spencer on , just ready to come out—i was only gone down to speak to patty again about the pork—jane was standing in the passage—were not you , jane ? —for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting-pan large enough . so i said i would go down and see , and jane said , ‘ shall i go down instead ? for i think you have a little cold , and patty has been washing the kitchen. ’ — ‘ oh ! my dear , ’ said i—well , and just then came the note . a miss hawkins—that ’ s all i know . a miss hawkins of bath . but , mr. knightley , how could you possibly have heard it ? for the very moment mr. cole told mrs. cole of it , she sat down and wrote to me . a miss hawkins— ”
austen	emma	“ well , miss woodhouse , ” he almost immediately began , “ your inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away , i hope , by the terrors of my father ’ s little rooms . i bring a new proposal on the subject : —a thought of my father ’ s , which waits only your approbation to be acted upon . may i hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball , to be given , not at randalls , but at the crown inn ? ”
austen	emma	“ i shall be very glad to look it over , ” said he ; “ but it seems long . i will take it home with me at night. ” but that would not do . mr. weston was to call in the evening , and she must return it by him .
austen	emma	“ it is frank and miss fairfax , ” said mrs. weston . “ i was just going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning . he stays till to-morrow , and miss fairfax has been persuaded to spend the day with us.—they are coming in , i hope . ”
austen	emma	“ you are very kind , but i know what my manners were to you.—so cold and artificial ! —i had always a part to act.—it was a life of deceit ! —i know that i must have disgusted you . ”
austen	emma	emma recollected , blushed , was sorry , but tried to laugh it off . “ nay , how could i help saying what i did ? —nobody could have helped it . it was not so very bad . i dare say she did not understand me . ”
austen	emma	while he spoke , emma ’ s mind was most busy , and , with all the wonderful velocity of thought , had been able—and yet without losing a word—to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole ; to see that harriet ’ s hopes had been entirely groundless , a mistake , a delusion , as complete a delusion as any of her own—that harriet was nothing ; that she was every thing herself ; that what she had been saying relative to harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings ; and that her agitation , her doubts , her reluctance , her discouragement , had been all received as discouragement from herself.—and not only was there time for these convictions , with all their glow of attendant happiness ; there was time also to rejoice that harriet ’ s secret had not escaped her , and to resolve that it need not , and should not.—it was all the service she could now render her poor friend ; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to harriet , as infinitely the most worthy of the two—or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever , without vouchsafing any motive , because he could not marry them both , emma had it not . she felt for harriet , with pain and with contrition ; but no flight of generosity run mad , opposing all that could be probable or reasonable , entered her brain . she had led her friend astray , and it would be a reproach to her for ever ; but her judgment was as strong as her feelings , and as strong as it had ever been before , in reprobating any such alliance for him , as most unequal and degrading . her way was clear , though not quite smooth.—she spoke then , on being so entreated.—what did she say ? —just what she ought , of course . a lady always does.—she said enough to shew there need not be despair—and to invite him to say more himself . he _had_ despaired at one period ; he had received such an injunction to caution and silence , as for the time crushed every hope ; —she had begun by refusing to hear him.—the change had perhaps been somewhat sudden ; —her proposal of taking another turn , her renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to , might be a little extraordinary ! —she felt its inconsistency ; but mr. knightley was so obliging as to put up with it , and seek no farther explanation .
austen	emma	“ handsome ! oh ! no—far from it—certainly plain . i told you he was plain. ” “ my dear , you said that miss campbell would not allow him to be plain , and that you yourself— ”
austen	emma	her father ’ s feelings were quite distinct . he thought principally of mrs. churchill ’ s illness , and wanted to know how she was treated ; and as for the ball , it was shocking to have dear emma disappointed ; but they would all be safer at home .
austen	emma	“ what a precious deposit ! ” said he with a tender sigh , as he received it . “ this man is almost too gallant to be in love , ” thought emma . “ i should say so , but that i suppose there may be a hundred different ways of being in love . he is an excellent young man , and will suit harriet exactly ; it will be an ‘ exactly so , ’ as he says himself ; but he does sigh and languish , and study for compliments rather more than i could endure as a principal . i come in for a pretty good share as a second . but it is his gratitude on harriet ’ s account . ”
austen	emma	captain weston was a general favourite ; and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to miss churchill , of a great yorkshire family , and miss churchill fell in love with him , nobody was surprized , except her brother and his wife , who had never seen him , and who were full of pride and importance , which the connexion would offend .
austen	emma	“ aye , that ’ s very just , indeed , that ’ s very properly said . very true . ‘ woman , lovely woman. ’ it is such a pretty charade , my dear , that i can easily guess what fairy brought it.—nobody could have written so prettily , but you , emma . ”
austen	emma	“ yes , so i imagined . i was afraid there could be little chance of my hearing any thing of miss fairfax to-day. ” “ so obliging of you ! no , we should not have heard , if it had not been for this particular circumstance , of her being to come here so soon . my mother is so delighted ! —for she is to be three months with us at least . three months , she says so , positively , as i am going to have the pleasure of reading to you . the case is , you see , that the campbells are going to ireland . mrs. dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly . they had not intended to go over till the summer , but she is so impatient to see them again—for till she married , last october , she was never away from them so much as a week , which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms , i was going to say , but however different countries , and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother—or her father , i declare i do not know which it was , but we shall see presently in jane ’ s letter—wrote in mr. dixon ’ s name as well as her own , to press their coming over directly , and they would give them the meeting in dublin , and take them back to their country seat , baly-craig , a beautiful place , i fancy . jane has heard a great deal of its beauty ; from mr. dixon , i mean—i do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else ; but it was very natural , you know , that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses—and as jane used to be very often walking out with them—for colonel and mrs. campbell were very particular about their daughter ’ s not walking out often with only mr. dixon , for which i do not at all blame them ; of course she heard every thing he might be telling miss campbell about his own home in ireland ; and i think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place , views that he had taken himself . he is a most amiable , charming young man , i believe . jane was quite longing to go to ireland , from his account of things . ”
austen	emma	“ i do remember it , ” cried emma ; “ i perfectly remember it.—talking about spruce-beer.—oh ! yes—mr . knightley and i both saying we liked it , and mr. elton ’ s seeming resolved to learn to like it too . i perfectly remember it.—stop ; mr. knightley was standing just here , was not he ? i have an idea he was standing just here . ”
austen	emma	with such sensations , mr. elton ’ s civilities were dreadfully ill-timed ; but she had the comfort of appearing very polite , while feeling very cross—and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again , or the substance of it , from the open-hearted mr. weston.—so it proved ; —for when happily released from mr. elton , and seated by mr. weston , at dinner , he made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality , the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton , to say to her ,
austen	emma	“ ah ! —so you say ; but i can not believe it. ” “ i must see somebody very superior to any one i have seen yet , to be tempted ; mr. elton , you know , ( recollecting herself , ) is out of the question : and i do _not_ wish to see any such person . i would rather not be tempted . i can not really change for the better . if i were to marry , i must expect to repent it . ”
austen	emma	emma , in the meanwhile , could not be satisfied without a dinner at hartfield for the eltons . they must not do less than others , or she should be exposed to odious suspicions , and imagined capable of pitiful resentment . a dinner there must be . after emma had talked about it for ten minutes , mr. woodhouse felt no unwillingness , and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself , with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him .
austen	emma	chapter xvi every body in and about highbury who had ever visited mr. elton , was disposed to pay him attention on his marriage . dinner-parties and evening-parties were made for him and his lady ; and invitations flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were never to have a disengaged day .
austen	emma	the contrast between the countenance and air of mr. knightley and robert martin was , at this moment , so strong to emma ’ s feelings , and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on harriet ’ s side , so fresh the sound of those words , spoken with such emphasis , “ no , i hope i know better than to think of robert martin , ” that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove , in some measure , premature . it could not be otherwise .
austen	emma	“ yes , i would . i could not bear to have henry supplanted.—mr . knightley marry ! —no , i have never had such an idea , and i can not adopt it now . and jane fairfax , too , of all women ! ”
austen	emma	“ oh ! my dear sir , her throat is so much better that i have hardly any uneasiness about it . either bathing has been of the greatest service to her , or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of mr. wingfield ’ s , which we have been applying at times ever since august . ”
austen	emma	“ good god ! ” cried emma , “ this has been a most unfortunate—most deplorable mistake ! —what is to be done ? ” “ you would not have encouraged me , then , if you had understood me ? at least , however , i can not be worse off than i should have been , if the other had been the person ; and now—it _is_ possible— ”
austen	emma	isabella turned to mrs. weston for her approbation of the plan . mrs. weston could only approve . isabella then went to emma ; but emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away ; and they were still discussing the point , when mr. knightley , who had left the room immediately after his brother ’ s first report of the snow , came back again , and told them that he had been out of doors to examine , and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home , whenever they liked it , either now or an hour hence . he had gone beyond the sweep—some way along the highbury road—the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep—in many places hardly enough to whiten the ground ; a very few flakes were falling at present , but the clouds were parting , and there was every appearance of its being soon over . he had seen the coachmen , and they both agreed with him in there being nothing to apprehend .
austen	emma	for miss ——— , read miss smith . my first displays the wealth and pomp of kings , lords of the earth ! their luxury and ease . that is _court_ . another view of man , my second brings ; behold him there , the monarch of the seas !
austen	emma	“ you may well class the delight , the honour , and the comfort of such a situation together , ” said jane , “ they are pretty sure to be equal ; however , i am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me . i am exceedingly obliged to you , mrs. elton , i am obliged to any body who feels for me , but i am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer . for two or three months longer i shall remain where i am , and as i am . ”
austen	emma	“ you are very obliging.—frank will be extremely happy , i am sure.— he is to be in town next week , if not sooner . we have notice of it in a letter to-day . i met the letters in my way this morning , and seeing my son ’ s hand , presumed to open it—though it was not directed to me—it was to mrs. weston . she is his principal correspondent , i assure you . i hardly ever get a letter . ”
austen	emma	“ it will be natural for me , ” he added shortly afterwards , “ to speak my opinion aloud as i read . by doing it , i shall feel that i am near you . it will not be so great a loss of time : but if you dislike it— ”
austen	emma	“ here have i , ” said she , “ actually talked poor harriet into being very much attached to this man . she might never have thought of him but for me ; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope , if i had not assured her of his attachment , for she is as modest and humble as i used to think him . oh ! that i had been satisfied with persuading her not to accept young martin . there i was quite right . that was well done of me ; but there i should have stopped , and left the rest to time and chance . i was introducing her into good company , and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having ; i ought not to have attempted more . but now , poor girl , her peace is cut up for some time . i have been but half a friend to her ; and if she were _not_ to feel this disappointment so very much , i am sure i have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her ; —william coxe—oh ! no , i could not endure william coxe—a pert young lawyer . ”
austen	emma	“ i hope i should know better , ” he replied ; “ no , depend upon it , ( with a gallant bow , ) that in addressing mrs. weston i should understand whom i might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my terms . ”
austen	emma	emma agreed to it , and with a blush of sensibility on harriet ’ s account , which she could not give any sincere explanation of . “ you had better go on , ” said she . he did so , but very soon stopt again to say , “ the pianoforte ! ah ! that was the act of a very , very young man , one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure . a boyish scheme , indeed ! —i can not comprehend a man ’ s wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense with ; and he did know that she would have prevented the instrument ’ s coming if she could . ”
austen	emma	“ are you well , my emma ? ” was mrs. weston ’ s parting question . “ oh ! perfectly . i am always well , you know . be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible . ”
austen	emma	it was a sweet view—sweet to the eye and the mind . english verdure , english culture , english comfort , seen under a sun bright , without being oppressive . in this walk emma and mr. weston found all the others assembled ; and towards this view she immediately perceived mr. knightley and harriet distinct from the rest , quietly leading the way . mr. knightley and harriet ! —it was an odd tête-à-tête ; but she was glad to see it.—there had been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion , and turned from her with little ceremony . now they seemed in pleasant conversation . there had been a time also when emma would have been sorry to see harriet in a spot so favourable for the abbey mill farm ; but now she feared it not . it might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity and beauty , its rich pastures , spreading flocks , orchard in blossom , and light column of smoke ascending.—she joined them at the wall , and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around . he was giving harriet information as to modes of agriculture , etc . and emma received a smile which seemed to say , “ these are my own concerns . i have a right to talk on such subjects , without being suspected of introducing robert martin. ” —she did not suspect him . it was too old a story.—robert martin had probably ceased to think of harriet.—they took a few turns together along the walk.—the shade was most refreshing , and emma found it the pleasantest part of the day .
austen	emma	“ my dear , you do not understand me . this is a matter of mere common politeness and good-breeding , and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry. ” emma had done . her father was growing nervous , and could not understand _her_ . her mind returned to mrs. elton ’ s offences , and long , very long , did they occupy her .
austen	emma	“ well—if you please , ” said mrs. weston rather hesitating , “ if you think she will be of any use. ” “ you will get nothing to the purpose from miss bates , ” said emma . “ she will be all delight and gratitude , but she will tell you nothing . she will not even listen to your questions . i see no advantage in consulting miss bates . ”
austen	emma	if any thing could be more , where all was most , she was more reserved on the subject of weymouth and the dixons than any thing . she seemed bent on giving no real insight into mr. dixon ’ s character , or her own value for his company , or opinion of the suitableness of the match . it was all general approbation and smoothness ; nothing delineated or distinguished . it did her no service however . her caution was thrown away . emma saw its artifice , and returned to her first surmises . there probably _was_ something more to conceal than her own preference ; mr. dixon , perhaps , had been very near changing one friend for the other , or been fixed only to miss campbell , for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds .
austen	emma	“ and had you really some at hand yourself ? i am sure i never suspected it , you did it so naturally. ” “ and so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for his sake ! ” said emma , recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided between wonder and amusement . and secretly she added to herself , “ lord bless me ! when should i ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court-plaister that frank churchill had been pulling about ! i never was equal to this . ”
austen	emma	harriet was too intent on the lines to hear . the most satisfactory comparisons were rising in her mind . “ it is one thing , ” said she , presently—her cheeks in a glow— “ to have very good sense in a common way , like every body else , and if there is any thing to say , to sit down and write a letter , and say just what you must , in a short way ; and another , to write verses and charades like this . ”
austen	emma	“ i do not know . i rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than i deserve . i smile because you smile , and shall probably suspect whatever i find you suspect ; but at present i do not see what there is to question . if colonel campbell is not the person , who can be ? ”
austen	emma	“ you appear to feel a great deal—but i am not aware how you or any of miss fairfax ’ s acquaintance here , any of those who have known her longer than yourself , can shew her any other attention than ” —
austen	emma	“ perhaps she might ; but it is not every man ’ s fate to marry the woman who loves him best . miss hawkins perhaps wanted a home , and thought this the best offer she was likely to have . ”
austen	emma	“ oh ! miss woodhouse , believe me i have not the presumption to suppose— indeed i am not so mad.—but it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distance—and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world , with the gratitude , wonder , and veneration , which are so proper , in me especially . ”
austen	emma	mr. weston , with triumph of a different sort , was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time , but had not said a word , lest it should make mr. woodhouse uncomfortable , and be an excuse for his hurrying away . as to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return , that was a mere joke ; he was afraid they would find no difficulty . he wished the road might be impassable , that he might be able to keep them all at randalls ; and with the utmost good-will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body , calling on his wife to agree with him , that with a little contrivance , every body might be lodged , which she hardly knew how to do , from the consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house .
austen	emma	“ so they will , my dear . that is a great thing . not that james ever complains ; but it is right to spare our horses when we can . if i could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired—but is mrs. stokes to be trusted ? i doubt it . i do not know her , even by sight . ”
austen	emma	“ dating from three o ’ clock yesterday . my perpetual influence could not begin earlier , or you would not have been so much out of humour before. ” “ three o ’ clock yesterday ! that is your date . i thought i had seen you first in february . ”
austen	emma	she felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant , as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building , its suitable , becoming , characteristic situation , low and sheltered—its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream , of which the abbey , with all the old neglect of prospect , had scarcely a sight—and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues , which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up.—the house was larger than hartfield , and totally unlike it , covering a good deal of ground , rambling and irregular , with many comfortable , and one or two handsome rooms.—it was just what it ought to be , and it looked what it was—and emma felt an increasing respect for it , as the residence of a family of such true gentility , untainted in blood and understanding.—some faults of temper john knightley had ; but isabella had connected herself unexceptionably . she had given them neither men , nor names , nor places , that could raise a blush . these were pleasant feelings , and she walked about and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did , and collect round the strawberry-beds.—the whole party were assembled , excepting frank churchill , who was expected every moment from richmond ; and mrs. elton , in all her apparatus of happiness , her large bonnet and her basket , was very ready to lead the way in gathering , accepting , or talking—strawberries , and only strawberries , could now be thought or spoken of.— “ the best fruit in england—every body ’ s favourite—always wholesome.—these the finest beds and finest sorts.—delightful to gather for one ’ s self—the only way of really enjoying them.—morning decidedly the best time—never tired—every sort good—hautboy infinitely superior—no comparison—the others hardly eatable—hautboys very scarce—chili preferred—white wood finest flavour of all—price of strawberries in london—abundance about bristol—maple grove—cultivation—beds when to be renewed—gardeners thinking exactly different—no general rule—gardeners never to be put out of their way—delicious fruit—only too rich to be eaten much of—inferior to cherries—currants more refreshing—only objection to gathering strawberries the stooping—glaring sun—tired to death—could bear it no longer—must go and sit in the shade . ”
austen	emma	“ how is it possible ? ” cried emma , turning her glowing cheeks towards him ; for , while she spoke , it occurred to her that he might have called at mrs. goddard ’ s in his way .
austen	emma	“ to fall in with each other on such an errand as this , ” thought emma ; “ to meet in a charitable scheme ; this will bring a great increase of love on each side . i should not wonder if it were to bring on the declaration . it must , if i were not here . i wish i were anywhere else . ”
austen	emma	harriet , she found , had never in her life been inside the vicarage , and her curiosity to see it was so extreme , that , considering exteriors and probabilities , emma could only class it , as a proof of love , with mr. elton ’ s seeing ready wit in her .
austen	emma	“ you are right . it was not very flattering to miss campbell ; but she really did not seem to feel it. ” “ so much the better—or so much the worse : —i do not know which . but be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her—quickness of friendship , or dulness of feeling—there was one person , i think , who must have felt it : miss fairfax herself . she must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction . ”
austen	emma	“ the crown ! ” “ yes ; if you and mr. woodhouse see no objection , and i trust you can not , my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there . better accommodations , he can promise them , and not a less grateful welcome than at randalls . it is his own idea . mrs. weston sees no objection to it , provided you are satisfied . this is what we all feel . oh ! you were perfectly right ! ten couple , in either of the randalls rooms , would have been insufferable ! —dreadful ! —i felt how right you were the whole time , but was too anxious for securing _any_ _thing_ to like to yield . is not it a good exchange ? —you consent—i hope you consent ? ”
austen	emma	volume ii chapter i emma and harriet had been walking together one morning , and , in emma ’ s opinion , had been talking enough of mr. elton for that day . she could not think that harriet ’ s solace or her own sins required more ; and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned ; —but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded , and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter , and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive— “ mr . elton is so good to the poor ! ” she found something else must be done .
austen	emma	“ i have no doubt of their being happy together , ” said emma ; “ i believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached. ” “ he is a most fortunate man ! ” returned mr. knightley , with energy . “ so early in life—at three-and-twenty—a period when , if a man chuses a wife , he generally chuses ill. at three-and-twenty to have drawn such a prize ! what years of felicity that man , in all human calculation , has before him ! —assured of the love of such a woman—the disinterested love , for jane fairfax ’ s character vouches for her disinterestedness ; every thing in his favour , —equality of situation—i mean , as far as regards society , and all the habits and manners that are important ; equality in every point but one—and that one , since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted , such as must increase his felicity , for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants.—a man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from ; and he who can do it , where there is no doubt of _her_ regard , must , i think , be the happiest of mortals.—frank churchill is , indeed , the favourite of fortune . every thing turns out for his good.—he meets with a young woman at a watering-place , gains her affection , can not even weary her by negligent treatment—and had he and all his family sought round the world for a perfect wife for him , they could not have found her superior.—his aunt is in the way.—his aunt dies.—he has only to speak.—his friends are eager to promote his happiness.—he had used every body ill—and they are all delighted to forgive him.—he is a fortunate man indeed ! ”
austen	emma	frank was standing by her , but not steadily ; there was a restlessness , which shewed a mind not at ease . he was looking about , he was going to the door , he was watching for the sound of other carriages , —impatient to begin , or afraid of being always near her .
austen	emma	mr. elton certainly did not very well know what to say . he looked rather doubtingly—rather confused ; said something about “ honour , ” —glanced at emma and at harriet , and then seeing the book open on the table , took it up , and examined it very attentively . with the view of passing off an awkward moment , emma smilingly said ,
austen	emma	“ oh ! no—i hope i shall not be ridiculous about it . do as you please. ” mr. woodhouse came in , and very soon led to the subject again , by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of “ well , my dears , how does your book go on ? —have you got any thing fresh ? ”
austen	emma	“ no , indeed—_we_ are not at all in a bad air . our part of london is very superior to most others ! —you must not confound us with london in general , my dear sir . the neighbourhood of brunswick square is very different from almost all the rest . we are so very airy ! i should be unwilling , i own , to live in any other part of the town ; —there is hardly any other that i could be satisfied to have my children in : but _we_ are so remarkably airy ! —mr . wingfield thinks the vicinity of brunswick square decidedly the most favourable as to air . ”
austen	emma	mr. frank churchill still declined it , looking as serious as he could , and his father gave his hearty support by calling out , “ my good friend , this is quite unnecessary ; frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it , and as to mrs. bates ’ s , he may get there from the crown in a hop , step , and jump . ”
austen	emma	“ no , certainly not ; i shall go home in the cool of the evening. ” “ but you may come again in the cool of to-morrow morning. ” “ no—it will not be worth while . if i come , i shall be cross . ”
austen	emma	“ here , ” resumed harriet , turning to her box again , “ here is something still more valuable , i mean that _has_ _been_ more valuable , because this is what did really once belong to him , which the court-plaister never did . ”
austen	emma	“ there is no saying , indeed , ” replied harriet rather solemnly . “ but there may be pretty good guessing . he will be a completely gross , vulgar farmer , totally inattentive to appearances , and thinking of nothing but profit and loss . ”
austen	emma	it was by no means his daughter ’ s wish that the intellects of highbury in general should be put under requisition . mr. elton was the only one whose assistance she asked . he was invited to contribute any really good enigmas , charades , or conundrums that he might recollect ; and she had the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections ; and at the same time , as she could perceive , most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant , nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass his lips . they owed to him their two or three politest puzzles ; and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled , and rather sentimentally recited , that well-known charade ,
austen	emma	mr. john knightley was a tall , gentleman-like , and very clever man ; rising in his profession , domestic , and respectable in his private character ; but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing ; and capable of being sometimes out of humour . he was not an ill-tempered man , not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach ; but his temper was not his great perfection ; and , indeed , with such a worshipping wife , it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be increased . the extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his . he had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted , and he could sometimes act an ungracious , or say a severe thing .
austen	emma	“ four o ’ clock ! —depend upon it he will be here by three , ” was mr. weston ’ s quick amendment ; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting . emma ’ s spirits were mounted quite up to happiness ; every thing wore a different air ; james and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as before . when she looked at the hedges , she thought the elder at least must soon be coming out ; and when she turned round to harriet , she saw something like a look of spring , a tender smile even there .
austen	emma	there was one person among his new acquaintance in surry , not so leniently disposed . in general he was judged , throughout the parishes of donwell and highbury , with great candour ; liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man—one who smiled so often and bowed so well ; but there was one spirit among them not to be softened , from its power of censure , by bows or smiles—mr . knightley . the circumstance was told him at hartfield ; for the moment , he was silent ; but emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself , over a newspaper he held in his hand , “ hum ! just the trifling , silly fellow i took him for. ” she had half a mind to resent ; but an instant ’ s observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings , and not meant to provoke ; and therefore she let it pass .
austen	emma	“ i am quite easy on that head , ” replied mrs. weston . “ i am very sure that i never said any thing of either to the other , which both might not have heard . ”
austen	emma	“ my dearest emma , do not pretend , with your sweet temper , to understand a bad one , or to lay down rules for it : you must let it go its own way . i have no doubt of his having , at times , considerable influence ; but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand _when_ it will be . ”
austen	emma	“ oh yes ! —there is a great difference . but mr. weston is almost an old man . mr. weston must be between forty and fifty. ” “ which makes his good manners the more valuable . the older a person grows , harriet , the more important it is that their manners should not be bad ; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness , or coarseness , or awkwardness becomes . what is passable in youth is detestable in later age . mr. martin is now awkward and abrupt ; what will he be at mr. weston ’ s time of life ? ”
austen	emma	before the end of september , emma attended harriet to church , and saw her hand bestowed on robert martin with so complete a satisfaction , as no remembrances , even connected with mr. elton as he stood before them , could impair.—perhaps , indeed , at that time she scarcely saw mr. elton , but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself.—robert martin and harriet smith , the latest couple engaged of the three , were the first to be married .
austen	emma	no second meeting had there yet been between him and emma . the room at the crown was to witness it ; —but it would be better than a common meeting in a crowd . mr. weston had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves , for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came , that she could not refuse him , and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man ’ s company . she was to convey harriet , and they drove to the crown in good time , the randalls party just sufficiently before them .
austen	emma	“ i never had the smallest , i assure you. ” “ that appears quite wonderful . i was once very near—and i wish i had—it would have been better . but though i was always doing wrong things , they were very bad wrong things , and such as did me no service.—it would have been a much better transgression had i broken the bond of secrecy and told you every thing . ”
austen	emma	“ open the windows ! —but surely , mr. churchill , nobody would think of opening the windows at randalls . nobody could be so imprudent ! i never heard of such a thing . dancing with open windows ! —i am sure , neither your father nor mrs. weston ( poor miss taylor that was ) would suffer it . ”
austen	emma	“ you are sick of prosperity and indulgence . can not you invent a few hardships for yourself , and be contented to stay ? ” “ _i_ sick of prosperity and indulgence ! you are quite mistaken . i do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged . i am thwarted in every thing material . i do not consider myself at all a fortunate person . ”
austen	emma	perfect happiness , even in memory , is not common ; and there were two points on which she was not quite easy . she doubted whether she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman , in betraying her suspicions of jane fairfax ’ s feelings to frank churchill . it was hardly right ; but it had been so strong an idea , that it would escape her , and his submission to all that she told , was a compliment to her penetration , which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue .
austen	emma	her own father ’ s perfect exemption from any thought of the kind , the entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion , was a most comfortable circumstance . happily he was not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it.—though always objecting to every marriage that was arranged , he never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any ; it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons ’ understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were proved against them . she blessed the favouring blindness . he could now , without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise , without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest , give way to all his natural kind-hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after mr. frank churchill ’ s accommodation on his journey , through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road , and express very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold—which , however , he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till after another night .
austen	emma	chapter ii jane fairfax was an orphan , the only child of mrs. bates ’ s youngest daughter . the marriage of lieut . fairfax of the ——regiment of infantry , and miss jane bates , had had its day of fame and pleasure , hope and interest ; but nothing now remained of it , save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action abroad—of his widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwards—and this girl .
austen	emma	“ you ought to know your friend best , ” replied mr. knightley ; “ but i should say she was a good-tempered , soft-hearted girl , not likely to be very , very determined against any young man who told her he loved her . ”
austen	emma	“ good morning to you , ” —said he , rising and walking off abruptly . he was very much vexed . he felt the disappointment of the young man , and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it , by the sanction he had given ; and the part which he was persuaded emma had taken in the affair , was provoking him exceedingly .
austen	emma	and woman , lovely woman , reigns alone . can it be neptune ? behold him there , the monarch of the seas ! or a trident ? or a mermaid ? or a shark ? oh , no ! shark is only one syllable . it must be very clever , or he would not have brought it . oh ! miss woodhouse , do you think we shall ever find it out ? ”
austen	emma	“ i am sorry to find , my love , that my father does not think you looking well—but i hope it is only from being a little fatigued . i could have wished , however , as you know , that you had seen mr. wingfield before you left home . ”
austen	emma	mr. john knightley proved more talkative than his brother . he was to leave them early the next day ; and he soon began with— “ well , emma , i do not believe i have any thing more to say about the boys ; but you have your sister ’ s letter , and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure . my charge would be much more concise than her ’ s , and probably not much in the same spirit ; all that i have to recommend being comprised in , do not spoil them , and do not physic them . ”
austen	emma	“ not five minutes to spare even for your friends miss fairfax and miss bates ? how unlucky ! miss bates ’ s powerful , argumentative mind might have strengthened yours. ” “ yes—i _have_ called there ; passing the door , i thought it better . it was a right thing to do . i went in for three minutes , and was detained by miss bates ’ s being absent . she was out ; and i felt it impossible not to wait till she came in . she is a woman that one may , that one _must_ laugh at ; but that one would not wish to slight . it was better to pay my visit , then ” —
austen	emma	mr. woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his friend perry , to whom he had , in fact , though unconsciously , been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions ; —but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil , and the immediate alertness of one brother , and better recollections of the other , prevented any renewal of it .
austen	emma	while waiting for the carriage , she found mr. knightley by her side . he looked around , as if to see that no one were near , and then said , “ emma , i must once more speak to you as i have been used to do : a privilege rather endured than allowed , perhaps , but i must still use it . i can not see you acting wrong , without a remonstrance . how could you be so unfeeling to miss bates ? how could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character , age , and situation ? —emma , i had not thought it possible . ”
austen	emma	the persons to be invited , required little thought . besides the eltons , it must be the westons and mr. knightley ; so far it was all of course—and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little harriet must be asked to make the eighth : —but this invitation was not given with equal satisfaction , and on many accounts emma was particularly pleased by harriet ’ s begging to be allowed to decline it . “ she would rather not be in his company more than she could help . she was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy wife together , without feeling uncomfortable . if miss woodhouse would not be displeased , she would rather stay at home. ” it was precisely what emma would have wished , had she deemed it possible enough for wishing . she was delighted with the fortitude of her little friend—for fortitude she knew it was in her to give up being in company and stay at home ; and she could now invite the very person whom she really wanted to make the eighth , jane fairfax.— since her last conversation with mrs. weston and mr. knightley , she was more conscience-stricken about jane fairfax than she had often been.—mr . knightley ’ s words dwelt with her . he had said that jane fairfax received attentions from mrs. elton which nobody else paid her .
austen	emma	“ oh ! leave all that to me . only give me a carte-blanche.—i am lady patroness , you know . it is my party . i will bring friends with me. ” “ i hope you will bring elton , ” said he : “ but i will not trouble you to give any other invitations . ”
austen	emma	“ the post-office is a wonderful establishment ! ” said she.— “ the regularity and despatch of it ! if one thinks of all that it has to do , and all that it does so well , it is really astonishing ! ”
austen	emma	“ and can not you call me ‘ george ’ now ? ” “ impossible ! —i never can call you any thing but ‘ mr . knightley. ’ i will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of mrs. elton , by calling you mr. k.—but i will promise , ” she added presently , laughing and blushing— “ i will promise to call you once by your christian name . i do not say when , but perhaps you may guess where ; —in the building in which n. takes m. for better , for worse . ”
austen	emma	emma was out of hearing . she had hurried on before her guests to prepare her father for their appearance , and was beyond the reach of mr. weston ’ s hint . “ why , to own the truth , ” cried miss bates , who had been trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes , “ if i must speak on this subject , there is no denying that mr. frank churchill might have—i do not mean to say that he did not dream it—i am sure i have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world—but if i am questioned about it , i must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring ; for mrs. perry herself mentioned it to my mother , and the coles knew of it as well as ourselves—but it was quite a secret , known to nobody else , and only thought of about three days . mrs. perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage , and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed . jane , don ’ t you remember grandmama ’ s telling us of it when we got home ? i forget where we had been walking to—very likely to randalls ; yes , i think it was to randalls . mrs. perry was always particularly fond of my mother—indeed i do not know who is not—and she had mentioned it to her in confidence ; she had no objection to her telling us , of course , but it was not to go beyond : and , from that day to this , i never mentioned it to a soul that i know of . at the same time , i will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint , because i know i do sometimes pop out a thing before i am aware . i am a talker , you know ; i am rather a talker ; and now and then i have let a thing escape me which i should not . i am not like jane ; i wish i were . i will answer for it _she_ never betrayed the least thing in the world . where is she ? —oh ! just behind . perfectly remember mrs. perry ’ s coming.—extraordinary dream , indeed ! ”
austen	emma	“ had you any idea , ” cried harriet , “ of his being in love with her ? —you , perhaps , might.—you ( blushing as she spoke ) who can see into every body ’ s heart ; but nobody else— ” “ upon my word , ” said emma , “ i begin to doubt my having any such talent . can you seriously ask me , harriet , whether i imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that i was—tacitly , if not openly—encouraging you to give way to your own feelings ? —i never had the slightest suspicion , till within the last hour , of mr. frank churchill ’ s having the least regard for jane fairfax . you may be very sure that if i had , i should have cautioned you accordingly . ”
austen	emma	“ nobody ever did think well of the churchills , i fancy , ” observed mr. john knightley coolly . “ but you need not imagine mr. weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up henry or john . mr. weston is rather an easy , cheerful-tempered man , than a man of strong feelings ; he takes things as he finds them , and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other , depending , i suspect , much more upon what is called society for his comforts , that is , upon the power of eating and drinking , and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week , than upon family affection , or any thing that home affords . ”
austen	emma	“ yes i should , i am sure i should . there is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them . you think you carry it off very well , i dare say , but with you it is a sort of bravado , an air of affected unconcern ; i always observe it whenever i meet you under those circumstances . _now_ you have nothing to try for . you are not afraid of being supposed ashamed . you are not striving to look taller than any body else . _now_ i shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you . ”
austen	emma	“ no , my dear , i never encouraged any body to marry , but i would always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady—and a bride , especially , is never to be neglected . more is avowedly due to _her_ . a bride , you know , my dear , is always the first in company , let the others be who they may . ”
austen	emma	“ your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about mr. elton ’ s marrying , harriet , is the strongest reproach you can make _me_ . you could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake i fell into . it was all my doing , i know . i have not forgotten it , i assure you.—deceived myself , i did very miserably deceive you—and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever . do not imagine me in danger of forgetting it . ”
austen	emma	there was a strange rumour in highbury of all the little perrys being seen with a slice of mrs. weston ’ s wedding-cake in their hands : but mr. woodhouse would never believe it .
austen	emma	emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour . the preparing and the going abroad in such weather , with the sacrifice of his children after dinner , were evils , were disagreeables at least , which mr. john knightley did not by any means like ; he anticipated nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase ; and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his discontent .
austen	emma	she was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate , indulgent father ; and had , in consequence of her sister ’ s marriage , been mistress of his house from a very early period . her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses ; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess , who had fallen little short of a mother in affection .
austen	emma	“ we have been calling at randalls , ” said she , “ and found them both at home ; and very pleasant people they seem to be . i like them extremely . mr. weston seems an excellent creature—quite a first-rate favourite with me already , i assure you . and _she_ appears so truly good—there is something so motherly and kind-hearted about her , that it wins upon one directly . she was your governess , i think ? ”
austen	emma	harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion , with great self-command . what ever she might feel of brighter hope , she betrayed nothing . emma was gratified , to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character , and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance . they spoke , therefore , of mrs. churchill ’ s death with mutual forbearance .
austen	emma	“ oh , mrs. churchill ; every body knows mrs. churchill , ” replied isabella : “ and i am sure i never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion . to be constantly living with an ill-tempered person , must be dreadful . it is what we happily have never known any thing of ; but it must be a life of misery . what a blessing , that she never had any children ! poor little creatures , how unhappy she would have made them ! ”
austen	emma	miss churchill , however , being of age , and with the full command of her fortune—though her fortune bore no proportion to the family-estate—was not to be dissuaded from the marriage , and it took place , to the infinite mortification of mr. and mrs. churchill , who threw her off with due decorum . it was an unsuitable connexion , and did not produce much happiness . mrs. weston ought to have found more in it , for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him ; but though she had one sort of spirit , she had not the best . she had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother , but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother ’ s unreasonable anger , nor from missing the luxuries of her former home . they lived beyond their income , but still it was nothing in comparison of enscombe : she did not cease to love her husband , but she wanted at once to be the wife of captain weston , and miss churchill of enscombe .
austen	emma	she could not speak another word.—her voice was lost ; and she sat down , waiting in great terror till harriet should answer . harriet , who was standing at some distance , and with face turned from her , did not immediately say any thing ; and when she did speak , it was in a voice nearly as agitated as emma ’ s .
austen	emma	“ i am very much obliged to you , ” said emma , laughing again . “ if i had set my heart on mr. elton ’ s marrying harriet , it would have been very kind to open my eyes ; but at present i only want to keep harriet to myself . i have done with match-making indeed . i could never hope to equal my own doings at randalls . i shall leave off while i am well . ”
austen	emma	“ my dear isabella , ” —exclaimed he hastily— “ pray do not concern yourself about my looks . be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and the children , and let me look as i chuse. ” “ i did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother , ” cried emma , “ about your friend mr. graham ’ s intending to have a bailiff from scotland , to look after his new estate . what will it answer ? will not the old prejudice be too strong ? ”
austen	emma	“ we can finish this some other time , you know . you and i shall not want opportunities . and , in fact , you have heard all the essential already . i only wanted to prove to you that mrs. s. admits our apology , and is not offended . you see how delightfully she writes . oh ! she is a sweet creature ! you would have doated on her , had you gone.—but not a word more . let us be discreet—quite on our good behaviour.—hush ! —you remember those lines—i forget the poem at this moment :
austen	emma	chapter xiii the weather continued much the same all the following morning ; and the same loneliness , and the same melancholy , seemed to reign at hartfield—but in the afternoon it cleared ; the wind changed into a softer quarter ; the clouds were carried off ; the sun appeared ; it was summer again . with all the eagerness which such a transition gives , emma resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible . never had the exquisite sight , smell , sensation of nature , tranquil , warm , and brilliant after a storm , been more attractive to her . she longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce ; and on mr. perry ’ s coming in soon after dinner , with a disengaged hour to give her father , she lost no time in hurrying into the shrubbery.—there , with spirits freshened , and thoughts a little relieved , she had taken a few turns , when she saw mr. knightley passing through the garden door , and coming towards her.—it was the first intimation of his being returned from london . she had been thinking of him the moment before , as unquestionably sixteen miles distant.—there was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind . she must be collected and calm . in half a minute they were together . the “ how d ’ ye do ’ s ” were quiet and constrained on each side . she asked after their mutual friends ; they were all well.—when had he left them ? —only that morning . he must have had a wet ride.—yes.—he meant to walk with her , she found . “ he had just looked into the dining-room , and as he was not wanted there , preferred being out of doors. ” —she thought he neither looked nor spoke cheerfully ; and the first possible cause for it , suggested by her fears , was , that he had perhaps been communicating his plans to his brother , and was pained by the manner in which they had been received .
austen	emma	mr. knightley had done all in his power for mr. woodhouse ’ s entertainment . books of engravings , drawers of medals , cameos , corals , shells , and every other family collection within his cabinets , had been prepared for his old friend , to while away the morning ; and the kindness had perfectly answered . mr. woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused . mrs. weston had been shewing them all to him , and now he would shew them all to emma ; —fortunate in having no other resemblance to a child , than in a total want of taste for what he saw , for he was slow , constant , and methodical.—before this second looking over was begun , however , emma walked into the hall for the sake of a few moments ’ free observation of the entrance and ground-plot of the house—and was hardly there , when jane fairfax appeared , coming quickly in from the garden , and with a look of escape.—little expecting to meet miss woodhouse so soon , there was a start at first ; but miss woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of .
austen	emma	chapter v in this state of schemes , and hopes , and connivance , june opened upon hartfield . to highbury in general it brought no material change . the eltons were still talking of a visit from the sucklings , and of the use to be made of their barouche-landau ; and jane fairfax was still at her grandmother ’ s ; and as the return of the campbells from ireland was again delayed , and august , instead of midsummer , fixed for it , she was likely to remain there full two months longer , provided at least she were able to defeat mrs. elton ’ s activity in her service , and save herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her will .

austen	emma	chapter ix emma did not repent her condescension in going to the coles . the visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day ; and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion , must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity . she must have delighted the coles—worthy people , who deserved to be made happy ! —and left a name behind her that would not soon die away .
austen	emma	“ it is a sort of thing , ” cried mrs. elton emphatically , “ which _i_ should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into . though , perhaps , as the _chaperon_ of the party—_i_ never was in any circle—exploring parties—young ladies—married women— ”
austen	emma	“ true , true , ” he answered , warmly . “ no , not true on your side . you can have no superior , but most true on mine.—she is a complete angel . look at her . is not she an angel in every gesture ? observe the turn of her throat . observe her eyes , as she is looking up at my father.—you will be glad to hear ( inclining his head , and whispering seriously ) that my uncle means to give her all my aunt ’ s jewels . they are to be new set . i am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head . will not it be beautiful in her dark hair ? ”
austen	emma	“ ah ! ” said mr. woodhouse , shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her with tender concern.—the ejaculation in emma ’ s ear expressed , “ ah ! there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to south end . it does not bear talking of. ” and for a little while she hoped he would not talk of it , and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel . after an interval of some minutes , however , he began with ,
austen	emma	“ oh ! dear , kingston—are you ? —mrs . cole was saying the other day she wanted something from kingston. ” “ mrs . cole has servants to send . can i do any thing for _you_ ? ” “ no , i thank you . but do come in . who do you think is here ? —miss woodhouse and miss smith ; so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte . do put up your horse at the crown , and come in . ”
austen	emma	mr. weston ’ s ball was to be a real thing . a very few to-morrows stood between the young people of highbury and happiness . mr. woodhouse was resigned . the time of year lightened the evil to him . may was better for every thing than february . mrs. bates was engaged to spend the evening at hartfield , james had due notice , and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little henry nor dear little john would have any thing the matter with them , while dear emma were gone .
austen	emma	it was weather which might fairly confine every body at home ; and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other , it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house , too wise to stir out ; and to hear him say to mr. knightley , whom no weather could keep entirely from them , —
austen	emma	“ a man can not be more so , ” was his short , full answer . “ ah ! —indeed i am very sorry.—come , shake hands with me. ” this had just taken place and with great cordiality , when john knightley made his appearance , and “ how d ’ ye do , george ? ” and “ john , how are you ? ” succeeded in the true english style , burying under a calmness that seemed all but indifference , the real attachment which would have led either of them , if requisite , to do every thing for the good of the other .
austen	emma	“ oh ! you are too scrupulous , indeed you are , ” cried emma warmly , and taking her hand . “ you owe me no apologies ; and every body to whom you might be supposed to owe them , is so perfectly satisfied , so delighted even— ”
austen	emma	“ none ; not one . he positively said that it had been known to no being in the world but their two selves. ” “ well , ” said emma , “ i suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the idea , and i wish them very happy . but i shall always think it a very abominable sort of proceeding . what has it been but a system of hypocrisy and deceit , —espionage , and treachery ? —to come among us with professions of openness and simplicity ; and such a league in secret to judge us all ! —here have we been , the whole winter and spring , completely duped , fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour , with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying round , comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hear.—they must take the consequence , if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable ! ”
austen	emma	he bowed . “ if not in our dispositions , ” she presently added , with a look of true sensibility , “ there is a likeness in our destiny ; the destiny which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own . ”
austen	emma	“ only think of our happening to meet him ! —how very odd ! it was quite a chance , he said , that he had not gone round by randalls . he did not think we ever walked this road . he thought we walked towards randalls most days . he has not been able to get the romance of the forest yet . he was so busy the last time he was at kingston that he quite forgot it , but he goes again to-morrow . so very odd we should happen to meet ! well , miss woodhouse , is he like what you expected ? what do you think of him ? do you think him so very plain ? ”
austen	emma	the morning of the interesting day arrived , and mrs. weston ’ s faithful pupil did not forget either at ten , or eleven , or twelve o ’ clock , that she was to think of her at four .
austen	emma	“ has your son been with you , then ? ” “ oh ! yes—did not you know ? —well , well , never mind. ” for a moment he was silent ; and then added , in a tone much more guarded and demure ,
austen	emma	“ very true , mr. weston , perfectly true . it is just what i used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship , when , because things did not go quite right , did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his feelings , he was apt to be in despair , and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be _may_ before hymen ’ s saffron robe would be put on for us . oh ! the pains i have been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views ! the carriage—we had disappointments about the carriage ; —one morning , i remember , he came to me quite in despair . ”
austen	pride	“ this is a wretched beginning , indeed ! my sole dependence was on you ; and i am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not . yet , indeed , i am in earnest . i speak nothing but the truth . he still loves me , and we are engaged . ”
austen	pride	“ is this , ” thought elizabeth , “ meant for me ? ” and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , “ and pray , what is the usual price of an earl ’ s younger son ? unless the elder brother is very sickly , i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . ”
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ the apothecary came ” ] [ illustration : “ covering a screen ” ] chapter viii . [ illustration ] at five o ’ clock the two ladies retired to dress , and at half-past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner . to the civil inquiries which then poured in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr. bingley , she could not make a very favourable answer . jane was by no means better . the sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ; and then thought no more of the matter : and their indifference towards jane , when not immediately before them , restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike .
austen	pride	heading to chapter xv . 89
austen	pride	“ my beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners -- my behaviour to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not . now , be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ? ”
austen	pride	he seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologized for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within . they then sat down , and when her inquiries after rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence . it was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something ; and in this emergency recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , --
austen	pride	“ but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event. ” “ a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe . if _she_ does not object to it , why should _we_ ? ”
austen	pride	they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas ; and mr. gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in london the very next day , and would assist mr. bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia .
austen	pride	“ he never failed to inform them ” 211
austen	pride	“ i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family . the far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances . where there is fortune to make the expense of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil . but that is not the case _here_ . mr. and mrs. collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys -- and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance . ”
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ protested he must be entirely mistaken. ” [ _copyright 1894 by george allen._ ] ] chapter xxiii . [ illustration ] elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she was authorized to mention it , when sir william lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family . with many compliments to them , and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , -- to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for mrs. bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken ; and lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed , --
austen	pride	it was a fortnight since mrs. bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits oppressively high . no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph . the marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials , fine muslins , new carriages , and servants . she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter ; and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance .
austen	pride	“ she did not choose it , ” said her daughter ; “ she would go. ” “ she is a very fine-looking woman ! and her calling here was prodigiously civil ! for she only came , i suppose , to tell us the collinses were well . she is on her road somewhere , i dare say ; and so , passing through meryton , thought she might as well call on you . i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , lizzy ? ”
austen	pride	“ if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is , i shall know what to think. ” “ she is a very good kind of girl , i believe . i know no harm of her . ”
austen	pride	“ i am not going to run away , papa , ” said kitty , fretfully . “ if _i_ should ever go to brighton , i would behave better than lydia. ” “ _you_ go to brighton ! i would not trust you so near it as eastbourne , for fifty pounds ! no , kitty , i have at least learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it . no officer is ever to enter my house again , nor even to pass through the village . balls will be absolutely prohibited , unless you stand up with one of your sisters . and you are never to stir out of doors , till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner . ”
austen	pride	on the following monday , mrs. bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came , as usual , to spend the christmas at longbourn . mr. gardiner was a sensible , gentlemanlike man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education . the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well-bred and agreeable . mrs. gardiner , who was several years younger than mrs. bennet and mrs. philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with her longbourn nieces . between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard . they had frequently been staying with her in town .
austen	pride	she was at least free from the offence of mr. darcy ’ s further notice : though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak . she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr. wickham , and rejoiced in it .
austen	pride	“ and what is fifty miles of good road ? little more than half a day ’ s journey . yes , i call it a very easy distance. ” “ i should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_ of the match , ” cried elizabeth . “ i should never have said mrs. collins was settled _near_ her family . ”
austen	pride	on the very last day of the regiment ’ s remaining in meryton , he dined , with others of the officers , at longbourn ; and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good-humour , that , on his making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford , she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam ’ s and mr. darcy ’ s having both spent three weeks at rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former .
austen	pride	“ engaged by the river ” 327
austen	pride	they were interrupted by miss bennet , who came to fetch her mother ’ s tea . “ this is a parade , ” cried he , “ which does one good ; it gives such an elegance to misfortune ! another day i will do the same ; i will sit in my library , in my nightcap and powdering gown , and give as much trouble as i can , -- or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away . ”
austen	pride	a long dispute followed this declaration ; but mr. bennet was firm : it soon led to another ; and mrs. bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter . he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion . mrs. bennet could hardly comprehend it . that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid , exceeded all that she could believe possible . she was more alive to the disgrace , which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter ’ s nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they took place .
austen	pride	“ very true , indeed ; and now , my dear jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ? do clear _them_ , too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody . ”
austen	pride	the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr. wickham ’ s charge exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice . she had never heard of him before his entrance into the -- -- shire militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance . of his former way of life , nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told
austen	pride	at length , every idea seemed to fail him ; and after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave . the others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ; but elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence . she was overpowered by shame and vexation . her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill-judged thing in the world ! how strange must it appear to him ! in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man ! it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again ! oh ! why did she come ? or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ? had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination ; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage . she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting . and his behaviour , so strikingly altered , -- what could it mean ? that he should even speak to her was amazing ! -- but to speak with such civility , to inquire after her family ! never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting . what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park , when he put his letter into her hand ! she knew not what to think , or how to account for it .
austen	pride	the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic . bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life ; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him ; there had been no formality , no stiffness ; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ; and as to miss bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful . darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure . miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty ; but she smiled too much .
austen	pride	“ _you_ began the evening well , charlotte , ” said mrs. bennet , with civil self-command , to miss lucas . “ _you_ were mr. bingley ’ s first choice. ” “ yes ; but he seemed to like his second better . ”
austen	pride	her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained . but when they had withdrawn , he said to her , “ mrs . bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding . into _one_ house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance . i will not encourage the imprudence of either , by receiving them at longbourn . ”
austen	pride	elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; but mrs. bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed .
austen	pride	but when the gentlemen entered , jane was no longer the first object ; miss bingley ’ s eyes were instantly turned towards darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps . he addressed himself directly to miss bennet with a polite congratulation ; mr. hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was “ very glad ; ” but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley ’ s salutation . he was full of joy and attention . the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed , at his desire , to the other side of the fireplace , that she might be farther from the door . he then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to anyone else . elizabeth , at work in the opposite corner , saw it all with great delight .
austen	pride	“ yours , very sincerely , “ m . gardiner. ” the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share . the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced , of what mr. darcy might have been doing to forward her sister ’ s match -- which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation -- were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true ! he had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce . he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem . her heart did whisper that he had done it for her . but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations ; and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham . brother-in-law of wickham ! every kind of pride must revolt from the connection . he had , to be sure , done much . she was ashamed to think how much . but he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief . it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could perhaps believe , that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned . it was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return . they owed the restoration of lydia , her character , everything to him . oh , how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him ! for herself she was humbled ; but she was proud of him , -- proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself . she read over her aunt ’ s commendation of him again and again . it was hardly enough ; but it pleased her . she was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr. darcy and herself .
austen	pride	“ i know not , miss elizabeth , ” said he , “ whether mrs. collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us ; but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it . the favour of your company has been much felt , i assure you . we know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode . our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done everything in our power to prevent you spending your time unpleasantly . ”
austen	pride	miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy ’ s marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley , she dropped all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of georgiana , almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth .
austen	pride	the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery , where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; mr. bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield , which was fixed for the following tuesday . the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation . to the rest of the family they paid little attention ; avoiding mrs. bennet as much as possible , saying not much to elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others . they were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs. bennet ’ s civilities .
austen	pride	mr. bennet made no answer . “ do not you want to know who has taken it ? ” cried his wife , impatiently . “ _you_ want to tell me , and i have no objection to hearing it . ”
austen	pride	“ i found , ” said he , “ as the time drew near , that i had better not meet mr. darcy ; -- that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than i could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself . ”
austen	pride	“ you excel so much in the dance , miss eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , i am sure , to oblige us for one half hour . ”
austen	pride	“ what is it you mean ? ” “ it is a circumstance which darcy of course could not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady ’ s family it would be an unpleasant thing . ”
austen	pride	and when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , “ oh , but there were two or three much uglier in the shop ; and when i have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh , i think it will be very tolerable . besides , it will not much signify what one wears this summer , after the -- -- shire have left meryton , and they are going in a fortnight . ”
austen	pride	the loss of her daughter made mrs. bennet very dull for several days . “ i often think , ” said she , “ that there is nothing so bad as parting with one ’ s friends . one seems so forlorn without them . ”
austen	pride	“ why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , ” said she , “ did he come at all ? ” she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure . “ he could be still amiable , still pleasing to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ? if he fears me , why come hither ? if he no longer cares for me , why silent ? teasing , teasing man ! i will think no more about him . ”
austen	pride	in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and jane to make her resigned . as for elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia , that she considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and detestable as such a step must make her , were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go . she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia ’ s general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs. forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home . he heard her attentively , and then said , --
austen	pride	“ perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr. robinson : did not i mention it to you ? mr. robinson ’ s asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and _which_ he thought the prettiest ? and his answering immediately to the last question , ‘ oh , the eldest miss bennet , beyond a doubt : there can not be two opinions on that point . ’ ”
austen	pride	“ his being so sure of succeeding was wrong , ” said she , “ and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment. ” “ indeed , ” replied elizabeth , “ i am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me . you do not blame me , however , for refusing him ? ”
austen	pride	but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information . mr. darcy had been at her sister ’ s wedding . it was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go . conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none . those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable . she could not bear such suspense ; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what lydia had dropped , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended .
austen	pride	/ * right “ gracechurch street , _sept . 6_ . * / “ my dear niece , “ i have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as i foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise what i have to tell you . i must confess myself surprised by your application ; i did not expect it from _you_ . don ’ t think me angry , however , for i only mean to let you know , that i had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on _your_ side . if you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence . your uncle is as much surprised as i am ; and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done . but if you are really innocent and ignorant , i must be more explicit . on the very day of my coming home from longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor . mr. darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours . it was all over before i arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have been . he came to tell mr. gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr. wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both -- wickham repeatedly , lydia once . from what i can collect , he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them . the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham ’ s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him . he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world . his character was to speak for itself . he called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself . if he _had another_ motive , i am sure it would never disgrace him . he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than _we_ had ; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us . there is a lady , it seems , a mrs. younge , who was some time ago governess to miss darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what . she then took a large house in edward street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings . this mrs. younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town . but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted . she would not betray her trust , i suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found . wickham , indeed , had gone to her on their first arrival in london ; and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her . at length , however , our kind friend procured the wished-for direction . they were in -- -- street . he saw wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia . his first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance as far as it would go . but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was . she cared for none of her friends ; she wanted no help of his ; she would not hear of leaving wickham . she was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when . since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with wickham , he easily learnt had never been _his_ design . he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydia ’ s flight on her own folly alone . he meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it . he must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on . mr. darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once . though mr. bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage . but he found , in reply to this question , that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country . under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief . they met several times , for there was much to be discussed . wickham , of course , wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable . everything being settled between _them_ , mr. darcy ’ s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home . but mr. gardiner could not be seen ; and mr. darcy found , on further inquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning . he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former . he did not leave his name , and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business . on saturday he came again . your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as i said before , they had a great deal of talk together . they met again on sunday , and then _i_ saw him too . it was not all settled before monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to longbourn . but our visitor was very obstinate . i fancy , lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character , after all . he has been accused of many faults at different times ; but _this_ is the true one . nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though i am sure ( and i do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it ) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole . they battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved . but at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due . but , lizzy , this must go no further than yourself , or jane at most . you know pretty well , i suppose , what has been done for the young people . his debts are to be paid , amounting , i believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_ , and his commission purchased . the reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as i have given above . it was owing to him , to his reserve and want of proper consideration , that wickham ’ s character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was . perhaps there was some truth in _this_ ; though i doubt whether _his_ reserve , or _anybody ’ s_ reserve can be answerable for the event . but in spite of all this fine talking , my dear lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for _another interest_ in the affair . when all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish . i believe i have now told you everything . it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure . lydia came to us , and wickham had constant admission to the house . _he_ was exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire ; but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with _her_ behaviour while she stayed with us , if i had not perceived , by jane ’ s letter last wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain . i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family . if she heard me , it was by good luck , for i am sure she did not listen . i was sometimes quite provoked ; but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane , and for their sakes had patience with her . mr. darcy was punctual in his return , and , as lydia imformed you , attended the wedding . he dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday . will you be very angry with me , my dear lizzy , if i take this opportunity of saying ( what i was never bold enough to say before ) how much i like him ? his behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire . his understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and _that_ , if he marry _prudently_ , his wife may teach him . i thought him very sly ; he hardly ever mentioned your name . but slyness seems the fashion . pray forgive me , if i have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from p. i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park . a low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing . but i must write no more . the children have been wanting me this half hour .
austen	pride	“ it is difficult , indeed -- it is distressing . one does not know what to think. ” “ i beg your pardon ; -- one knows exactly what to think. ” but jane could think with certainty on only one point , -- that mr. bingley , if he _had been_ imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public .
austen	pride	he then told her of georgiana ’ s delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend .
austen	pride	“ i shall not say that you are mistaken , ” he replied , “ because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which , in fact , are not your own . ”
austen	pride	the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a manœuvre of mrs. bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family . mrs. hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves . they repulsed every attempt of mrs. bennet at conversation , and , by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr. collins , who was complimenting mr. bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests . darcy said nothing at all . mr. bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene . mr. bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other . elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs. hurst or miss bingley ; and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “ lord , how tired i am ! ” accompanied by a violent yawn .
austen	pride	“ that is a question which i hardly know how to answer . we all love to instruct , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing . forgive me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make _me_ your confidante . ”
austen	pride	“ well , all i know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him . but , however , that shan ’ t prevent my asking him to dine here , i am determined . we must have mrs. long and the gouldings soon . that will make thirteen with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him . ”
austen	pride	“ now i have got some news for you , ” said lydia , as they sat down to table . “ what do you think ? it is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like . ”
austen	pride	“ come , darcy , ” said he , “ i must have you dance . i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner . you had much better dance. ” “ i certainly shall not . you know how i detest it , unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner . at such an assembly as this , it would be insupportable . your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with . ”
austen	pride	miss darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than elizabeth ; and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance womanly and graceful . she was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good-humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle . elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr. darcy had been , was much relieved by discerning such different feelings .
austen	pride	_i suppose , however , that the majority of at least competent votes would , all things considered , be divided between_ emma _and the present book ; and perhaps the vulgar verdict ( if indeed a fondness for miss austen be not of itself a patent of exemption from any possible charge of vulgarity ) would go for_ emma . _it is the larger , the more varied , the more popular ; the author had by the time of its composition seen rather more of the world , and had improved her general , though not her most peculiar and characteristic dialogue ; such figures as miss bates , as the eltons , can not but unite the suffrages of everybody . on the other hand , i , for my part , declare for_ pride and prejudice _unhesitatingly . it seems to me the most perfect , the most characteristic , the most eminently quintessential of its author ’ s works ; and for this contention in such narrow space as is permitted to me , i propose here to show cause._
austen	pride	“ or , in other words , you are determined to have him . he is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane . but will they make you happy ? ”
austen	pride	“ don ’ t keep coughing so , kitty , for heaven ’ s sake ! have a little compassion on my nerves . you tear them to pieces. ” “ kitty has no discretion in her coughs , ” said her father ; “ she times them ill . ”
austen	pride	“ what could have become of mr. bingley and jane ? ” was a wonder which introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs . darcy was delighted with their engagement ; his friend had given him the earliest information of it .
austen	pride	“ and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting ! i might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little _endeavour_ at civility , i am thus rejected . but it is of small importance . ”
austen	pride	mr. gardiner added , in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was saturday . rendered spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brother-in-law ’ s entreaty that he would return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit . when mrs. bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before .
austen	pride	“ mr . wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his _making_ friends ; whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them , is less certain. ” “ he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , ” replied elizabeth , with emphasis , “ and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life . ”
austen	pride	“ i confess , ” said he , “ that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship ’ s asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings . i rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen . but who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there ( an invitation , moreover , including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival ? ”
austen	pride	on reaching the house , they were shown through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer . its windows , opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn .
austen	pride	this accounted to elizabeth for mr. wickham ’ s being among them . mrs. reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old . “ and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother ? ” said mr. gardiner .
austen	pride	[ illustration ] the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome ; nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly . lady catherine , it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr. darcy . it was a rational scheme , to be sure ! but from what the report of their engagement could originate , elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of bingley , and _her_ being the sister of jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another , to supply the idea . she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together . and her neighbours at lucas lodge , therefore , ( for through their communication with the collinses , the report , she concluded , had reached lady catherine , ) had only set _that_ down as almost certain and immediate which _she_ had looked forward to as possible at some future time .
austen	pride	“ then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce mr. bingley to _her_. ” “ impossible , mr. bennet , impossible , when i am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teasing ? ”
austen	pride	“ for heaven ’ s sake , madam , speak lower . what advantage can it be to you to offend mr. darcy ? you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing. ” nothing that she could say , however , had any influence . her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone . elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation . she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr. darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her . the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity .
austen	pride	“ not at all. ” “ he is a sweet-tempered , amiable , charming man . he can not know what mr. darcy is. ” “ probably not ; but mr. darcy can please where he chooses . he does not want abilities . he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while . among those who are at all his equals in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous . his pride never deserts him ; but with the rich he is liberal-minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and , perhaps , agreeable , -- allowing something for fortune and figure . ”
austen	pride	“ well , then , -- supposing them to be in london -- they may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose . it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in london , than in scotland . ”
austen	pride	“ i have not the pleasure of understanding you , ” said he , when she had finished her speech . “ of what are you talking ? ” “ of mr. collins and lizzy . lizzy declares she will not have mr. collins , and mr. collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy . ”
austen	pride	jane looked at her doubtingly . “ oh , lizzy ! it can not be . i know how much you dislike him. ” “ you know nothing of the matter . _that_ is all to be forgot . perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now ; but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable . this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself . ”
austen	pride	“ if you mean darcy , ” cried her brother , “ he may go to bed , if he chooses , before it begins ; but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing , and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards . ”
austen	pride	“ engaged to mr. collins ! my dear charlotte , impossible ! ” the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon regained her composure , and calmly replied , --
austen	pride	“ oh no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both . i know you will do him such ample justice , that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent . your profusion makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a feather . ”
austen	pride	“ the apothecary came ” 43
austen	pride	in the dining-room they were soon joined by mary and kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before . one came from her books , and the other from her toilette . the faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty . as for mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth , with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table , --
austen	pride	darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject . at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but , on perceiving mr. darcy , he stopped , with a bow of superior courtesy , to compliment him on his dancing and his partner .
austen	pride	“ if i have , i shall be the last person to confess it. ” “ miss bennet , do you know who i am ? i have not been accustomed to such language as this . i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns . ”
austen	pride	the tumult of elizabeth ’ s mind was allayed by this conversation . she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either . but there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbade the disclosure . she dared not relate the other half of mr. darcy ’ s letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend . here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery . “ and then , ” said she , “ if that very improbable event should ever take place , i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself . the liberty of communication can not be mine till it has lost all its value ! ”
austen	pride	“ you saw me dance at meryton , i believe , sir. ” “ yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight . do you often dance at st. james ’ s ? ” “ never , sir. ” “ do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? ”
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ offended two or three young ladies ” [ _copyright 1894 by george allen._ ] ] “ an excellent consolation in its way , ” said elizabeth ; “ but it will not do for _us_ . we do not suffer by accident . it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before . ”
austen	pride	“ it is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours. ” “ pray tell your sister that i long to see her. ” “ i have already told her so once , by your desire . ”
austen	pride	“ we will be down as soon as we can , ” said jane ; “ but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went upstairs half an hour ago . ”
austen	pride	“ oh , my dear , ” continued mrs. bennet , “ i am quite delighted with him . he is so excessively handsome ! and his sisters are charming women . i never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses . i dare say the lace upon mrs. hurst ’ s gown -- -- ”
austen	pride	when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford , every eye was in search of the parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view . the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side . elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants .
austen	pride	“ mr . bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ? you take delight in vexing me . you have no compassion on my poor nerves. ” “ you mistake me , my dear . i have a high respect for your nerves . they are my old friends . i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least . ”
austen	pride	when the ladies were separating for the toilette , he said to elizabeth , -- “ do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel . lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter . i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest -- there is no occasion for anything more . lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed . she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved . ”
austen	pride	when they ascended the steps to the hall , maria ’ s alarm was every moment increasing , and even sir william did not look perfectly calm . elizabeth ’ s courage did not fail her . she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere stateliness of money and rank she thought she could witness without trepidation .
austen	pride	their visits to mrs. philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence . every day added something to their knowledge of the officers ’ names and connections . their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the officers themselves . mr. philips visited them all , and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before . they could talk of nothing but officers ; and mr. bingley ’ s large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign .
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ so much love and eloquence ” [ _copyright 1894 by george allen._ ] ] excited before , how many years longer mr. bennet was likely to live ; and sir william gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever mr. collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st. james ’ s . the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion . the younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte ’ s dying an old maid . charlotte herself was tolerably composed . she had gained her point , and had time to consider of it . her reflections were in general satisfactory . mr. collins , to be sure , was neither sensible nor agreeable : his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary . but still he would be her husband . without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object : it was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune , and , however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want . this preservative she had now obtained ; and at the age of twenty-seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it . the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person . elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ; and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation . she resolved to give her the information herself ; and therefore charged mr. collins , when he returned to longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family . a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love .
austen	pride	“ i have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love , ” said darcy . “ of a fine , stout , healthy love it may . everything nourishes what is strong already . but if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away . ”
austen	pride	all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who , but three months before , had been almost an angel of light . he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his intrigues , all honoured with the title of seduction , had been extended into every tradesman ’ s family . everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world ; and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness . elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister ’ s ruin still more certain ; and even jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come , when , if they had gone to scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them .
austen	pride	“ i comfort myself with thinking , ” replied jane , “ that he certainly would not marry lydia , if he had not a real regard for her . though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , i can not believe that ten thousand pounds , or anything like it , has been advanced . he has children of his own , and may have more . how could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? ”
austen	pride	this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted ; and elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away . but before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her .
austen	pride	charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time . this was very amiable ; but charlotte ’ s kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of : -- its object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of mr. collins ’ s addresses , by engaging them towards herself . such was miss lucas ’ s scheme ; and appearances were so favourable , that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon . but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character ; for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet . he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that , if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ; for , though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday . his reception , however , was of the most flattering kind . miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane . but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there .
austen	pride	jane could have no reserves from elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ; and , instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world .
austen	pride	“ perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh , ” said elizabeth . “ it must be something particular to take him there at this time of year. ” “ undoubtedly . did you see him while you were at lambton ? i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had . ”
austen	pride	mrs. bennet and her daughters then departed , and elizabeth returned instantly to jane , leaving her own and her relations ’ behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr. darcy ; the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_ , in spite of all miss bingley ’ s witticisms on _fine eyes_ .
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ to assure you in the most animated language ” ] chapter xix . [ illustration ] the next day opened a new scene at longbourn . mr. collins made his declaration in form . having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner , with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business . on finding mrs. bennet , elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , --
austen	pride	“ he likes to have his own way very well , ” replied colonel fitzwilliam . “ but so we all do . it is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor . i speak feelingly . a younger son , you know , must be inured to self-denial and dependence . ”
austen	pride	“ but , my dear sister , can i be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? ” “ you must decide for yourself , ” said elizabeth ; “ and if , upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , i advise you , by all means , to refuse him . ”
austen	pride	_but the greatness of mr. collins could not have been so satisfactorily exhibited if his creatress had not adjusted so artfully to him the figures of mr. bennet and of lady catherine de bourgh . the latter , like mr. collins himself , has been charged with exaggeration . there is , perhaps , a very faint shade of colour for the charge ; but it seems to me very faint indeed . even now i do not think that it would be impossible to find persons , especially female persons , not necessarily of noble birth , as overbearing , as self-centred , as neglectful of good manners , as lady catherine . a hundred years ago , an earl ’ s daughter , the lady powerful ( if not exactly bountiful ) of an out-of-the-way country parish , rich , long out of marital authority , and so forth , had opportunities of developing these agreeable characteristics which seldom present themselves now . as for mr. bennet , miss austen , and mr. darcy , and even miss elizabeth herself , were , i am inclined to think , rather hard on him for the “ impropriety ” of his conduct . his wife was evidently , and must always have been , a quite irreclaimable fool ; and unless he had shot her or himself there was no way out of it for a man of sense and spirit but the ironic . from no other point of view is he open to any reproach , except for an excusable and not unnatural helplessness at the crisis of the elopement , and his utterances are the most acutely delightful in the consciously humorous kind -- in the kind that we laugh with , not at -- that even miss austen has put into the mouth of any of her characters . it is difficult to know whether he is most agreeable when talking to his wife , or when putting mr. collins through his paces ; but the general sense of the world has probably been right in preferring to the first rank his consolation to the former when she maunders over the entail , “ my dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts . let us hope for better things . let us flatter ourselves that_ i _may be the survivor ; ” and his inquiry to his colossal cousin as to the compliments which mr. collins has just related as made by himself to lady catherine , “ may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ? ” these are the things which give miss austen ’ s readers the pleasant shocks , the delightful thrills , which are felt by the readers of swift , of fielding , and we may here add , of thackeray , as they are felt by the readers of no other english author of fiction outside of these four._
austen	pride	every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety ; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected . the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning ’ s impatience . through letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated ; and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance .
austen	pride	“ oh , i am not at all afraid of her dying . people do not die of little trifling colds . she will be taken good care of . as long as she stays there , it is all very well . i would go and see her if i could have the carriage . ”
austen	pride	but why mr. darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand . it could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ; and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice -- a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself . he seldom appeared really animated . mrs. collins knew not what to make of him . colonel fitzwilliam ’ s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love her friend eliza , she set herself seriously to work to find it out : she watched him whenever they were at rosings , and whenever he came to hunsford ; but without much success . he certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was disputable . it was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind .
austen	pride	“ you are very cruel , ” said her sister , “ you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment. ” “ how hard it is in some cases to be believed ! and how impossible in others ! but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge ? ”
austen	pride	jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match : but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable . kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas , for mr. collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton .
austen	pride	“ she has one only daughter , the heiress of rosings , and of very extensive property. ” “ ah , ” cried mrs. bennet , shaking her head , “ then she is better off than many girls . and what sort of young lady is she ? is she handsome ? ”
austen	pride	elizabeth ’ s collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as miss bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to wickham , georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more . her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair ; and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully .
austen	pride	“ who do you mean , my dear ? i know of nobody that is coming , i am sure , unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in ; and i hope _my_ dinners are good enough for her . i do not believe she often sees such at home . ”
austen	pride	“ this will not do , ” said elizabeth ; “ you never will be able to make both of them good for anything . take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one . there is but such a quantity of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much . for my part , i am inclined to believe it all mr. darcy ’ s , but you shall do as you choose . ”
austen	pride	“ indeed , mr. collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary . you must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what i say . i wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise . in making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self-reproach . this matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled. ” and rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not mr. collins thus addressed her , --
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ she is tolerable ” [ _copyright 1894 by george allen._ ] ] “ which do you mean ? ” and turning round , he looked for a moment at elizabeth , till , catching her eye , he withdrew his own , and coldly said , “ she is tolerable : but not handsome enough to tempt _me_ ; and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men . you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are wasting your time with me . ”
austen	pride	their party in the dining-room was large , for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news ; and various were the subjects which occupied them : lady lucas was inquiring of maria , across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; mrs. bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , retailing them all to the younger miss lucases ; and lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person ’ s , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her .
austen	pride	“ walked back with them ” 148
austen	pride	she was engaged one day , as she walked , in re-perusing jane ’ s last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by mr. darcy , she saw , on looking up , that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her . putting away the letter immediately , and forcing a smile , she said , --
austen	pride	“ i can not bear to think that they should have all this estate . if it was not for the entail , i should not mind it. ” “ what should not you mind ? ” “ i should not mind anything at all . ”
austen	pride	“ how can you talk so ? ” said jane , faintly smiling ; “ you must know , that , though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , i could not hesitate. ” “ i did not think you would ; and that being the case , i can not consider your situation with much compassion . ”
austen	pride	elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend . “ did you speak from your own observation , ” said she , “ when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? ”
austen	pride	“ in marrying your nephew , i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere . he is a gentleman ; i am a gentleman ’ s daughter ; so far we are equal. ” “ true . you _are_ a gentleman ’ s daughter . but what was your mother ? who are your uncles and aunts ? do not imagine me ignorant of their condition . ”
austen	pride	“ yet it is hard , ” she sometimes thought , “ that this poor man can not come to a house , which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation ! i _will_ leave him to himself . ”
austen	pride	they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her , and , with an expression of civil disdain , thus accosted her , -- “ so , miss eliza , i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham ? your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old wickham , the late mr. darcy ’ s steward . let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for , as to mr. darcy ’ s using him ill , it is perfectly false : for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though george wickham has treated mr. darcy in a most infamous manner . i do not know the particulars , but i know very well that mr. darcy is not in the least to blame ; that he can not bear to hear george wickham mentioned ; and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way . his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing , indeed , and i wonder how he could presume to do it . i pity you , miss eliza , for this discovery of your favourite ’ s guilt ; but really , considering his descent , one could not expect much better . ”
austen	pride	wickham was not at all more distressed than herself ; but his manners were always so pleasing , that , had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all . elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man . _she_ blushed , and jane blushed ; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour .
austen	pride	“ i did not know that you intended to walk , ” said miss bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard . “ you used us abominably ill , ” answered mrs. hurst , “ running away without telling us that you were coming out . ”
austen	pride	“ i do assure you , sir , that i have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man . i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere . i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible . my feelings in every respect forbid it . can i speak plainer ? do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart . ”
austen	pride	“ you may depend upon my not mentioning it. ” “ and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley . what he told me was merely this : that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars ; and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer . ”
austen	pride	“ yes , indeed , ” cried mrs. bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood . “ i assure you there is quite as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town . ”
austen	pride	“ the first wish of my heart , ” said she to herself , “ is never more to be in company with either of them . their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this ! let me never see either one or the other again ! ”
austen	pride	even elizabeth began to fear -- not that bingley was indifferent -- but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away . unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive to jane ’ s happiness , and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring . the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters , and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment .
austen	pride	to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting . it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour . as for their mother , mr. collins ’ s letter had done away much of her ill-will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters .
austen	pride	it had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as miss darcy ’ s , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley -- for she had reached it only to a late breakfast -- ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning . they were , therefore , to go . elizabeth was pleased ; though when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply .
austen	pride	“ but you forget , mamma , ” said elizabeth , “ that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that mrs. long has promised to introduce him. ” “ i do not believe mrs. long will do any such thing . she has two nieces of her own . she is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and i have no opinion of her . ”
austen	pride	one morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to elizabeth , -- “ lizzy , i never gave _you_ an account of my wedding , i believe . you were not by , when i told mamma , and the others , all about it . are not you curious to hear how it was managed ? ”
austen	pride	“ your conjecture is totally wrong , i assure you . my mind was more agreeably engaged . i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow . ”
austen	pride	to pemberley , therefore , they were to go . [ illustration : “ conjecturing as to the date ” ] chapter xliii . [ illustration ] elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation ; and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter .
austen	pride	elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when unattended to by any of the rest , whether _all_ her sisters were at longbourn . there was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark ; but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning .
austen	pride	“ i am sure , ” said she , “ i cried for two days together when colonel miller ’ s regiment went away . i thought i should have broke my heart. ” “ i am sure i shall break _mine_ , ” said lydia .
austen	pride	_darcy has always seemed to me by far the best and most interesting of miss austen ’ s heroes ; the only possible competitor being henry tilney , whose part is so slight and simple that it hardly enters into comparison . it has sometimes , i believe , been urged that his pride is unnatural at first in its expression and later in its yielding , while his falling in love at all is not extremely probable . here again i can not go with the objectors . darcy ’ s own account of the way in which his pride had been pampered , is perfectly rational and sufficient ; and nothing could be , psychologically speaking , a_ causa verior _for its sudden restoration to healthy conditions than the shock of elizabeth ’ s scornful refusal acting on a nature_ ex hypothesi _generous . nothing in even our author is finer and more delicately touched than the change of his demeanour at the sudden meeting in the grounds of pemberley . had he been a bad prig or a bad coxcomb , he might have been still smarting under his rejection , or suspicious that the girl had come husband-hunting . his being neither is exactly consistent with the probable feelings of a man spoilt in the common sense , but not really injured in disposition , and thoroughly in love . as for his being in love , elizabeth has given as just an exposition of the causes of that phenomenon as darcy has of the conditions of his unregenerate state , only she has of course not counted in what was due to her own personal charm._
austen	pride	“ that will not do for a compliment to darcy , caroline , ” cried her brother , “ because he does _not_ write with ease . he studies too much for words of four syllables . do not you , darcy ? ”
austen	pride	it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now . “ you are too hasty , sir , ” she cried . “ you forget that i have made no answer . let me do it without further loss of time . accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me . i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them . ”

austen	pride	“ indeed , you are mistaken , madam ; i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here. ” “ miss bennet , ” replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , “ you ought to know that i am not to be trifled with . but however insincere _you_ may choose to be , you shall not find _me_ so . my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness ; and in a cause of such moment as this , i shall certainly not depart from it . a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago . i was told , that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that _you_ -- that miss elizabeth bennet would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew -- my own nephew , mr. darcy . though i _know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood , though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , i instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that i might make my sentiments known to you . ”
austen	pride	“ jane happened to look round ” 415
austen	pride	“ i never thought mr. darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you used to do. ” “ and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason . it is such a spur to one ’ s genius , such an opening for wit , to have a dislike of that kind . one may be continually abusive without saying anything just ; but one can not be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty . ”
austen	pride	yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former lover . when first he came in , he had spoken to her but little , but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention . he found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good-natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty . jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever ; but her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent .
austen	pride	“ how i long to see her again ! i never met with anybody who delighted me so much . such a countenance , such manners , and so extremely accomplished for her age ! her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite . ”
austen	pride	jane and elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told that he need not stay . lydia laughed , and said , -- “ ay , that is just like your formality and discretion . you thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared ! i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say . but he is an ugly fellow ! i am glad he is gone . i never saw such a long chin in my life . well , but now for my news : it is about dear wickham ; too good for the waiter , is not it ? there is no danger of wickham ’ s marrying mary king -- there ’ s for you ! she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool ; gone to stay . wickham is safe . ”
austen	pride	“ but she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow . if _i_ can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too . ”
austen	pride	“ in what an amiable light does this place him ! ” thought elizabeth . “ this fine account of him , ” whispered her aunt as they walked , “ is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend . ”
austen	pride	“ to assure you in the most animated language ” 132

austen	pride	“ and if i had not a letter to write myself , i might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did . but i have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . ”
austen	pride	“ lady catherine de bourgh , ” she replied , “ has very lately given him a living . i hardly know how mr. collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long . ”
austen	pride	“ you have only proved by this , ” cried elizabeth , “ that mr. bingley did not do justice to his own disposition . you have shown him off now much more than he did himself . ”
austen	pride	“ what a charming amusement for young people this is , mr. darcy ! there is nothing like dancing , after all . i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies . ”
austen	pride	“ but can you think that lydia is so lost to everything but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ? ” “ it does seem , and it is most shocking , indeed , ” replied elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , “ that a sister ’ s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt . but , really , i know not what to say . perhaps i am not doing her justice . but she is very young : she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity . she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way . since the -- -- shire were first quartered in meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head . she has been doing everything in her power , by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater -- what shall i call it ? -- susceptibility to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough . and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman . ”
austen	pride	mr. collins on his return highly gratified mrs. bennet by admiring mrs. philips ’ s manners and politeness . he protested that , except lady catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to her before . something , he supposed , might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life .
austen	pride	“ she is a most charming young lady , indeed . lady catherine herself says that , in point of true beauty , miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth . she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of , as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education , and who still resides with them . but she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies . ”
austen	pride	miss bennet paused a little , and then replied , “ surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully . what is your own opinion ? ” “ that it ought not to be attempted . mr. darcy has not authorized me to make his communication public . on the contrary , every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ? the general prejudice against mr. darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light . i am not equal to it . wickham will soon be gone ; and , therefore , it will not signify to anybody here what he really is . some time hence it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before . at present i will say nothing about it . ”
austen	pride	“ if it was to be a secret , ” said jane , “ say not another word on the subject . you may depend upon my seeking no further. ” “ oh , certainly , ” said elizabeth , though burning with curiosity ; “ we will ask you no questions . ”
austen	pride	lydia declared herself satisfied . “ oh yes -- it would be much better to wait till jane was well ; and by that time , most likely , captain carter would be at meryton again . and when you have given _your_ ball , ” she added , “ i shall insist on their giving one also . i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not . ”
austen	pride	“ beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose miss darcy , ” replied jane ; “ but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing . they have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better . but , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother ’ s . what sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ? if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us ; if he were so , they could not succeed . by supposing such an affection , you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong , and me most unhappy . do not distress me by the idea . i am not ashamed of having been mistaken -- or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters . let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood . ”
austen	pride	lady lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs. bennet . they had several children . the eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty-seven , was elizabeth ’ s intimate friend .
austen	pride	“ are you pleased with kent ? ” a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and concise -- and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk . the _tête-à-tête_ surprised them . mr. darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet , and , after sitting a few minutes longer , without saying much to anybody , went away .
austen	pride	“ when i am in the country , ” he replied , “ i never wish to leave it ; and when i am in town , it is pretty much the same . they have each their advantages , and i can be equally happy in either . ”
austen	pride	how differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned ! his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary ; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at anything . his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive : he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown . every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter ; and in further justification of mr. darcy , she could not but allow that mr. bingley , when questioned by jane , had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair ; -- that , proud and repulsive as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance -- an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways -- seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust -- anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits ; -- that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued ; -- that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling ; -- that had his actions been what wickham represented them , so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as mr. bingley was incomprehensible .
austen	pride	“ whenever she spoke in a low voice ” 166
austen	pride	[ illustration ] chapter xx . [ illustration ] mr. collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for mrs. bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast-room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection . mr. collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character .
austen	pride	“ undoubtedly , ” replied darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , “ there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation . whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable . ”
austen	pride	“ a man who has once been refused ! how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ? is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ? there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings . ”
austen	pride	they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ; and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves . the one mis-sent must be first attended to ; it had been written five days ago . the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ; but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence . it was to this effect : --
austen	pride	“ but perhaps you would like to read it ” 370
austen	pride	to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it . elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not . it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried . her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of mr. darcy ’ s indifference ; and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that , perhaps , instead of his seeing too _little_ , she might have fancied too _much_ .
austen	pride	“ why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks . i expected you to stay two months . i told mrs. collins so before you came . there can be no occasion for your going so soon . mrs. bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight . ”
austen	pride	“ do you really think so ? ” cried elizabeth , brightening up for a moment . “ upon my word , ” said mrs. gardiner , “ i begin to be of your uncle ’ s opinion . it is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it . i can not think so very ill of wickham . can you , yourself , lizzie , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? ”
austen	pride	“ now , i do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let mr. collins and me have a little conversation together. ” elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , jane and kitty followed , but lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and charlotte , detained first by the civility of mr. collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear . in a doleful voice mrs. bennet thus began the projected conversation : --
austen	pride	“ there were some very strong objections against the lady , ” were colonel fitzwilliam ’ s words ; and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in london .
austen	pride	“ i am far from attributing any part of mr. bingley ’ s conduct to design , ” said elizabeth ; “ but , without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error and there may be misery . thoughtlessness , want of attention to other people ’ s feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business . ”
austen	pride	“ i _have_ heard from authority , which i thought _as good_ , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron. ” “ you have ! yes , there was something in _that_ ; i told you so from the first , you may remember . ”
austen	pride	_the bingleys and the gardiners and the lucases , miss darcy and miss de bourgh , jane , wickham , and the rest , must pass without special comment , further than the remark that charlotte lucas ( her egregious papa , though delightful , is just a little on the thither side of the line between comedy and farce ) is a wonderfully clever study in drab of one kind , and that wickham ( though something of miss austen ’ s hesitation of touch in dealing with young men appears ) is a not much less notable sketch in drab of another . only genius could have made charlotte what she is , yet not disagreeable ; wickham what he is , without investing him either with a cheap don juanish attractiveness or a disgusting rascality . but the hero and the heroine are not tints to be dismissed._
austen	pride	“ my dear miss eliza , why are not you dancing ? mr. darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner . you can not refuse to dance , i am sure , when so much beauty is before you. ” and , taking her hand , he would have given it to mr. darcy , who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to sir william , --
austen	pride	“ you shall hear , then -- but prepare for something very dreadful . the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball -- and at this ball , what do you think he did ? he danced only four dances ! i am sorry to pain you , but so it was . he danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner . mr. darcy , you can not deny the fact . ”
austen	pride	very few days passed in which mr. collins did not walk to rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours . now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits . she examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence ; and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs. collins ’ s joints of meat were too large for her family .
austen	pride	“ it is well . you refuse , then , to oblige me . you refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude . you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world . ”
austen	pride	mr. gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks : mrs. reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister .
austen	pride	“ i _did_ hear , too , that there was a time when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been compromised accordingly . ”
austen	pride	“ you are quite a visit in my debt , mr. bingley , ” she added ; “ for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned . i have not forgot , you see ; and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement . ”
austen	pride	“ and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement ? ” “ i will make no promise of the kind. ” “ miss bennet , i am shocked and astonished . i expected to find a more reasonable young woman . but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede . i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require . ”
austen	pride	“ one of them does. ” “ why did not you all learn ? you ought all to have learned . the miss webbs all play , and their father has not so good an income as yours . do you draw ? ”
austen	pride	“ would mr. darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it ? ” “ upon my word , i can not exactly explain the matter -- darcy must speak for himself . ”
austen	pride	“ do you prefer reading to cards ? ” said he ; “ that is rather singular. ” “ miss eliza bennet , ” said miss bingley , “ despises cards . she is a great reader , and has no pleasure in anything else . ”
austen	pride	“ i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time . i did not expect such a compliment. ” “ did not you ? _i_ did for you . but that is one great difference between us . compliments always take _you_ by surprise , and _me_ never . what could be more natural than his asking you again ? he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room . no thanks to his gallantry for that . well , he certainly is very agreeable , and i give you leave to like him . you have liked many a stupider person . ”
austen	pride	heading to chapter lvi . 431
austen	pride	at length the parsonage was discernible . the garden sloping to the road , the house standing in it , the green pales and the laurel hedge , everything declared they were arriving . mr. collins and charlotte appeared at the door , and the carriage stopped at the small gate , which led by a short gravel walk to the house , amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party . in a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other . mrs. collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received . she saw instantly that her cousin ’ s manners were not altered by his marriage : his formal civility was just what it had been ; and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her family . they were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ; and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time , with ostentatious formality , to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wife ’ s offers of refreshment .
austen	pride	she had a sister married to a mr. philips , who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business , and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade .
austen	pride	anxiety on jane ’ s behalf was another prevailing concern ; and mr. darcy ’ s explanation , by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what jane had lost . his affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend . how grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so replete with advantage , so promising for happiness , jane had been deprived , by the folly and indecorum of her own family !
austen	pride	neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject . day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed mrs. bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood .
austen	pride	“ so much the better . i hope they will not meet at all . but does not jane correspond with his sister ? _she_ will not be able to help calling. ” “ she will drop the acquaintance entirely . ”
austen	pride	“ haye park might do , ” said she , “ if the gouldings would quit it , or the great house at stoke , if the drawing-room were larger ; but ashworth is too far off . i could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for purvis lodge , the attics are dreadful . ”
austen	pride	“ you have said quite enough , madam . i perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been . forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness . ”
austen	pride	from herself to jane , from jane to bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr. darcy ’ s explanation _there_ had appeared very insufficient ; and she read it again . widely different was the effect of a second perusal . how could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ? he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister ’ s attachment ; and she could not help remembering what charlotte ’ s opinion had always been . neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane . she felt that jane ’ s feelings , though fervent , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great sensibility .
austen	pride	she danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked . when those dances were over , she returned to charlotte lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr. darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him . he walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind : charlotte tried to console her .
austen	pride	“ i can much more easily believe mr. bingley ’ s being imposed on than that mr. wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , facts , everything mentioned without ceremony . if it be not so , let mr. darcy contradict it . besides , there was truth in his looks . ”
austen	pride	“ about a month , ” said elizabeth ; and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , “ he is a man of very large property in derbyshire , i understand. ” “ yes , ” replied wickham ; “ his estate there is a noble one . a clear ten thousand per annum . you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself -- for i have been connected with his family , in a particular manner , from my infancy . ”
austen	pride	while the family were in this confusion , charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them . she was met in the vestibule by lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , “ i am glad you are come , for there is such fun here ! what do you think has happened this morning ? mr. collins has made an offer to lizzy , and she will not have him . ”
austen	pride	“ elizabeth , you are not serious now. ” “ i beg your pardon . i will try again . at present i am not in love with mr. wickham ; no , i certainly am not . but he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man i ever saw -- and if he becomes really attached to me -- i believe it will be better that he should not . i see the imprudence of it . oh , _that_ abominable mr. darcy ! my father ’ s opinion of me does me the greatest honour ; and i should be miserable to forfeit it . my father , however , is partial to mr. wickham . in short , my dear aunt , i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see , every day , that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld , by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures , if i am tempted , or how am i even to know that it would be wiser to resist ? all that i can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry . i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object . when i am in company with him , i will not be wishing . in short , i will do my best . ”
austen	pride	elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and , at length , by repeated assurances that mr. darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months ’ suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father ’ s incredulity , and reconcile him to the match .
austen	pride	lydia was a stout , well-grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance ; a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age . she had high animal spirits , and a sort of natural self-consequence , which the attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle ’ s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance . she was very equal , therefore , to address mr. bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ; adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it . his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to her mother ’ s ear .
austen	pride	“ yes , madam , ” said mrs. bennet , delighted to speak to a lady catherine . “ she is my youngest girl but one . my youngest of all is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the ground , walking with a young man , who , i believe , will soon become a part of the family . ”
austen	pride	“ i must go instantly to my mother , ” she cried . “ i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude , or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself . he is gone to my father already . oh , lizzy , to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family ! how shall i bear so much happiness ? ”
austen	pride	miss bingley ’ s attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr. darcy ’ s progress through _his_ book , as in reading her own ; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page . she could not win him , however , to any conversation ; he merely answered her question and read on . at length , quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , “ how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way ! i declare , after all , there is no enjoyment like reading ! how much sooner one tires of anything than of a book ! when i have a house of my own , i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library . ”

austen	pride	elizabeth could not but look surprised . “ you may well be surprised , miss bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday . are you much acquainted with mr. darcy ? ”

austen	pride	“ she seems a very pleasant young woman , ” said bingley . “ oh dear , yes ; but you must own she is very plain . lady lucas herself has often said so , and envied me jane ’ s beauty . i do not like to boast of my own child ; but to be sure , jane -- one does not often see anybody better looking . it is what everybody says . i do not trust my own partiality . when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner ’ s in town so much in love with her , that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away . but , however , he did not . perhaps he thought her too young . however , he wrote some verses on her , and very pretty they were . ”

austen	pride	“ yes ; he introduced us to his sister. ” “ and do you like her ? ” “ very much. ” “ i have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two . when i last saw her , she was not very promising . i am very glad you liked her . i hope she will turn out well . ”
austen	pride	mrs. bennet , all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness . after sitting for a moment in silence , she said , very stiffly , to elizabeth , --
austen	pride	“ no , lizzy , that is what i do _not_ choose . i should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire. ” “ oh , if that is all , i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire ; and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better . i am sick of them all . thank heaven ! i am going to-morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manners nor sense to recommend him . stupid men are the only ones worth knowing , after all . ”
austen	pride	“ sir william ’ s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of. ” “ i do not think we were speaking at all . sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves . we have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next i can not imagine . ”
austen	pride	“ there is some sense in what he says about the girls , however ; and , if he is disposed to make them any amends , i shall not be the person to discourage him . ”
austen	pride	“ but if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer . mrs. collins will be very glad of your company , i am sure . ”
austen	pride	“ a thorough , determined dislike of me -- a dislike which i can not but attribute in some measure to jealousy . had the late mr. darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father ’ s uncommon attachment to me irritated him , i believe , very early in life . he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood -- the sort of preference which was often given me . ”
austen	pride	“ not that i _shall_ , though , ” she added to herself , and she finished the letter ; “ and , my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out . ”
austen	pride	“ you are not going to introduce yourself to mr. darcy ? ” “ indeed i am . i shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier . i believe him to be lady catherine ’ s _nephew_ . it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se ’ nnight . ”
austen	pride	“ and this , ” said she , “ is the end of all his friend ’ s anxious circumspection ! of all his sister ’ s falsehood and contrivance ! the happiest , wisest , and most reasonable end ! ” in a few minutes she was joined by bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose .
austen	pride	“ my dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts . let us hope for better things . let us flatter ourselves that _i_ may be the survivor. ” this was not very consoling to mrs. bennet ; and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before .
austen	pride	when first mr. bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless ; for , of course , they were to have a son . this son was to join in cutting off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for . five daughters successively entered the world , but yet the son was to come ; and mrs. bennet , for many years after lydia ’ s birth , had been certain that he would . this event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving . mrs. bennet had no turn for economy ; and her husband ’ s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income .
austen	pride	wickham ’ s affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to lydia ’ s for him . she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion .
austen	pride	“ is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year ? ” “ not so much as i could wish , sir : but i dare say he may spend half his time here ; and miss darcy is always down for the summer months . ”
austen	pride	she then ran gaily off , rejoicing , as she rambled about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two . jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening .
austen	pride	“ very , very much . nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight . but we considered it , we talked of it as impossible . and do you really love him quite well enough ? oh , lizzy ! do anything rather than marry without affection . are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? ”
austen	pride	the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world ; though only a few weeks before , when lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune .

austen	pride	wickham , lydia , were all forgotten . jane was beyond competition her favourite child . at that moment she cared for no other . her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense .
austen	pride	mr. darcy smiled ; but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended , and therefore checked her laugh . miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received , in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense .
austen	pride	to elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed . that his two sisters and mr. darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough ; and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable .
austen	pride	“ you are uniformly charming ! ” cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; “ and i am persuaded that , when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable . ”
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ at church ” ] chapter xxxi . [ illustration ] colonel fitzwilliam ’ s manners were very much admired at the parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings . it was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary ; and it was not till easter-day , almost a week after the gentlemen ’ s arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening . for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter . colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time , but mr. darcy they had only seen at church .
austen	pride	elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to miss darcy , without calling her attention . this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much : her own thoughts were employing her . she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room : she wished , she feared , that the master of the house might be amongst them ; and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine . after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing miss bingley ’ s voice , elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family . she answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more .
austen	pride	they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her ; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when bingley ’ s quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room . all elizabeth ’ s anger against him had been long done away ; but had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again . he inquired in a friendly , though general , way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done .
austen	pride	“ it is _not_ mr. bingley , ” said her husband ; “ it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life. ” this roused a general astonishment ; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once .
austen	pride	the surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great : but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased mrs. bennet ’ s curiosity ; and elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject .
austen	pride	“ mr . darcy is all politeness , ” said elizabeth , smiling . “ he is , indeed : but considering the inducement , my dear miss eliza , we can not wonder at his complaisance ; for who would object to such a partner ? ”
austen	pride	“ that is very true , ” replied elizabeth , “ and i could easily forgive _his_ pride , if he had not mortified _mine_. ” “ pride , ” observed mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections , “ is a very common failing , i believe . by all that i have ever read , i am convinced that it is very common indeed ; that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary . vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonymously . a person may be proud without being vain . pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves ; vanity to what we would have others think of us . ”
austen	pride	jane ’ s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall ; elizabeth was glad of it : -- till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante .
austen	pride	“ caroline bingley. ” “ with the officers ! ” cried lydia : “ i wonder my aunt did not tell us of _that_. ” “ dining out , ” said mrs. bennet ; “ that is very unlucky. ” “ can i have the carriage ? ” said jane .
austen	pride	but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ; and their raptures continued , with little intermission , to the very day of lydia ’ s leaving home . elizabeth was now to see mr. wickham for the last time . having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over ; the agitations of former partiality entirely so . she had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary . in his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure ; for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her . she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ; and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified , and her preference secured , at any time , by their renewal .

austen	pride	“ do you talk by rule , then , while you are dancing ? ” “ sometimes . one must speak a little , you know . it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together ; and yet , for the advantage of _some_ , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible . ”
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ i ’ m the tallest ” ] [ illustration : “ he rode a black horse ” ] chapter iii . [ illustration ] not all that mrs. bennet , however , with the assistance of her five daughters , could ask on the subject , was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr. bingley . they attacked him in various ways , with barefaced questions , ingenious suppositions , and distant surmises ; but he eluded the skill of them all ; and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour , lady lucas . her report was highly favourable . sir william had been delighted with him . he was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and , to crown the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party . nothing could be more delightful ! to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ; and very lively hopes of mr. bingley ’ s heart were entertained .
austen	pride	this information , however , startled mrs. bennet : she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not believe it , and could not help saying so .
austen	pride	“ i do not cough for my own amusement , ” replied kitty , fretfully . “ when is your next ball to be , lizzy ? ” “ to-morrow fortnight. ” “ ay , so it is , ” cried her mother , “ and mrs. long does not come back till the day before ; so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself . ”
austen	pride	“ not at all , ” was her answer ; “ but , depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it . ”
austen	pride	elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend ; for , though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him .
austen	pride	“ and of this place , ” thought she , “ i might have been mistress ! with these rooms i might have now been familiarly acquainted ! instead of viewing them as a stranger , i might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt . but , no , ” recollecting herself , “ that could never be ; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me ; i should not have been allowed to invite them . ”
austen	pride	elizabeth was disgusted , and even miss bennet was shocked . lydia was lydia still ; untamed , unabashed , wild , noisy , and fearless . she turned from sister to sister , demanding their congratulations ; and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there .
austen	pride	“ if he had had any compassion for _me_ , ” cried her husband impatiently , “ he would not have danced half so much ! for god ’ s sake , say no more of his partners . o that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance ! ”
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ a note for miss bennet ” [ _copyright 1894 by george allen._ ] ] chapter vii . [ illustration ] mr. bennet ’ s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed , in default of heirs male , on a distant relation ; and their mother ’ s fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of his . her father had been an attorney in meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds .
austen	pride	“ hate you ! i was angry , perhaps , at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction. ” “ i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at pemberley . you blamed me for coming ? ”
austen	pride	“ you need not distress yourself . the moral will be perfectly fair . lady catherine ’ s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts . i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude . i was not in a humour to wait for an opening of yours . my aunt ’ s intelligence had given me hope , and i was determined at once to know everything . ”
austen	pride	to this speech bingley made no answer ; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend ’ s vulgar relations .
austen	pride	[ illustration ] chapter xii . [ illustration ] in consequence of an agreement between the sisters , elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day . but mrs. bennet , who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday , which would exactly finish jane ’ s week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before . her answer , therefore , was not propitious , at least not to elizabeth ’ s wishes , for she was impatient to get home . mrs. bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday ; and in her postscript it was added , that if mr. bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well . against staying longer , however , elizabeth was positively resolved -- nor did she much expect it would be asked ; and fearful , on the contrary , of being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long , she urged jane to borrow mr. bingley ’ s carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made .
austen	pride	“ have you any other objection , ” said elizabeth , “ than your belief of my indifference ? ” “ none at all . we all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . ”
austen	pride	“ though it is difficult , ” said jane , “ to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit . ”
austen	pride	“ do not give way to useless alarm , ” added he : “ though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain . it is not quite a week since they left brighton . in a few days more , we may gain some news of them ; and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost . as soon as i get to town , i shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to gracechurch street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done . ”
austen	pride	“ to be sure , lizzy , ” said her aunt , “ he is not so handsome as wickham ; or rather he has not wickham ’ s countenance , for his features are perfectly good . but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ? ”
austen	pride	from his garden , mr. collins would have led them round his two meadows ; but the ladies , not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost , turned back ; and while sir william accompanied him , charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband ’ s help . it was rather small , but well built and convenient ; and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency , of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit . when mr. collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by charlotte ’ s evident enjoyment of it , elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten .
austen	pride	“ yes , always , ” she replied , without knowing what she said ; for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , “ i remember hearing you once say , mr. darcy , that you hardly ever forgave ; -- that your resentment , once created , was unappeasable . you are very cautious , i suppose , as to its _being created_ ? ”
austen	pride	“ there can be no doubt of that . it is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world . but are you pleased , jane ? shall you like to have such a brother ? ”

austen	pride	“ can you deny that you have done it ? ” she repeated . with assumed tranquillity he then replied , “ i have no wish of denying that i did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that i rejoice in my success . towards _him_ i have been kinder than towards myself . ”
austen	pride	“ by this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ; i wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so bewildered that i can not answer for being coherent . dearest lizzy , i hardly know what i would write , but i have bad news for you , and it can not be delayed . imprudent as a marriage between mr. wickham and our poor lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland . colonel forster came yesterday , having left brighton the day before , not many hours after the express . though lydia ’ s short letter to mrs. f. gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green , something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w. never intended to go there , or to marry lydia at all , which was repeated to colonel f. , who , instantly taking the alarm , set off from b. , intending to trace their route . he did trace them easily to clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place , they removed into a hackney-coach , and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom . all that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the london road . i know not what to think . after making every possible inquiry on that side london , colonel f. came on into hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes , and at the inns in barnet and hatfield , but without any success , -- no such people had been seen to pass through . with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart . i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs. f. ; but no one can throw any blame on them . our distress , my dear lizzy , is very great . my father and mother believe the worst , but i can not think so ill of him . many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a young woman of lydia ’ s connections , which is not likely , can i suppose her so lost to everything ? impossible ! i grieve to find , however , that colonel f. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage : he shook his head when i expressed my hopes , and said he feared w. was not a man to be trusted . my poor mother is really ill , and keeps her room . could she exert herself , it would be better , but this is not to be expected ; and as to my father , i never in my life saw him so affected . poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confidence , one can not wonder . i am truly glad , dearest lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ; but now , as the first shock is over , shall i own that i long for your return ? i am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient . adieu ! i take up my pen again to do , what i have just told you i would not ; but circumstances are such , that i can not help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible . i know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that i am not afraid of requesting it , though i have still something more to ask of the former . my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly , to try to discover her . what he means to do , i am sure i know not ; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way , and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again to-morrow evening . in such an exigence my uncle ’ s advice and assistance would be everything in the world ; he will immediately comprehend what i must feel , and i rely upon his goodness . ”
austen	pride	this was a sad omen of what her mother ’ s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and elizabeth found that , though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations ’ consent , there was still something to be wished for . but the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for mrs. bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion .
austen	pride	“ oh , yes -- the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished ! she plays and sings all day long . in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her -- a present from my master : she comes here to-morrow with him . ”
austen	pride	[ illustration ] chapter iv . [ illustration ] when jane and elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of mr. bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him .
austen	pride	“ i dare say you will find him very agreeable. ” “ heaven forbid ! _that_ would be the greatest misfortune of all ! to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate ! do not wish me such an evil . ”
austen	pride	“ you must not be too severe upon yourself , ” replied elizabeth . “ you may well warn me against such an evil . human nature is so prone to fall into it ! no , lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame . i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression . it will pass away soon enough . ”
austen	pride	“ the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from rosings park , her ladyship ’ s residence. ” “ i think you said she was a widow , sir ? has she any family ? ”
austen	pride	“ i must not decide on my own performance. ” he made no answer ; and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton . she answered in the affirmative ; and , unable to resist the temptation , added , “ when you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance . ”
austen	pride	“ you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters ; consequently that she is aunt to the present mr. darcy. ” “ no , indeed , i did not . i knew nothing at all of lady catherine ’ s connections . i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday . ”
austen	pride	elizabeth , feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances . the happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do . had elizabeth been able to encounter his eyes , she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him : but though she could not look she could listen ; and he told her of feelings which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable .
austen	pride	“ certainly , ” replied elizabeth , “ there are such people , but i hope i am not one of _them_ . i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good . follies and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies , _do_ divert me , i own , and i laugh at them whenever i can . but these , i suppose , are precisely what you are without . ”

austen	pride	“ jane , i congratulate you . you will be a very happy woman. ” jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness . “ you are a good girl , ” he replied , “ and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled . i have not a doubt of your doing very well together . your tempers are by no means unlike . you are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will cheat you ; and so generous , that you will always exceed your income . ”
austen	pride	not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did mrs. bennet give up the point . she talked to elizabeth again and again ; coaxed and threatened her by turns . she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest , but jane , with all possible mildness , declined interfering ; and elizabeth , sometimes with real earnestness , and sometimes with playful gaiety , replied to her attacks . though her manner varied , however , her determination never did .
austen	pride	“ the country , ” said darcy , “ can in general supply but few subjects for such a study . in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society. ” “ but people themselves alter so much , that there is something new to be observed in them for ever . ”
austen	pride	with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms . darcy , as well as elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them .
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ the elevation of his feelings. ” ] chapter xxxviii . [ illustration ] on saturday morning elizabeth and mr. collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared ; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary .
austen	pride	[ illustration ] chapter xlvi . [ illustration ] elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane on their first arrival at lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third her repining was over , and her sister justified , by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been mis-sent elsewhere . elizabeth was not surprised at it , as jane had written the direction remarkably ill .
austen	pride	“ compared with some families , i believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means . we were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary . those who chose to be idle certainly might . ”
austen	pride	“ that is exactly what i should have supposed of you , ” said elizabeth . “ you begin to comprehend me , do you ? ” cried he , turning towards her . “ oh yes -- i understand you perfectly. ” “ i wish i might take this for a compliment ; but to be so easily seen through , i am afraid , is pitiful . ”
austen	pride	but mr. gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ; and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended in the absence of her daughters .

austen	sense	“ for shame , for shame , miss dashwood ! how can you talk so ? don ’ t we all know that it must be a match , that they were over head and ears in love with each other from the first moment they met ? did not i see them together in devonshire every day , and all day long ; and did not i know that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding clothes ? come , come , this won ’ t do . because you are so sly about it yourself , you think nobody else has any senses ; but it is no such thing , i can tell you , for it has been known all over town this ever so long . i tell every body of it and so does charlotte . ”
austen	sense	“ indeed , ma ’ am , ” said elinor , very seriously , “ you are mistaken . indeed , you are doing a very unkind thing in spreading the report , and you will find that you have though you will not believe me now . ”
austen	sense	mrs. jennings laughed again , but elinor had not spirits to say more , and eager at all events to know what willoughby had written , hurried away to their room , where , on opening the door , she saw marianne stretched on the bed , almost choked by grief , one letter in her hand , and two or three others lying by her . elinor drew near , but without saying a word ; and seating herself on the bed , took her hand , kissed her affectionately several times , and then gave way to a burst of tears , which at first was scarcely less violent than marianne ’ s . the latter , though unable to speak , seemed to feel all the tenderness of this behaviour , and after some time thus spent in joint affliction , she put all the letters into elinor ’ s hands ; and then covering her face with her handkerchief , almost screamed with agony . elinor , who knew that such grief , shocking as it was to witness it , must have its course , watched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat spent itself , and then turning eagerly to willoughby ’ s letter , read as follows :
austen	sense	“ bond street , january . my dear madam , “ i have just had the honour of receiving your letter , for which i beg to return my sincere acknowledgments . i am much concerned to find there was anything in my behaviour last night that did not meet your approbation ; and though i am quite at a loss to discover in what point i could be so unfortunate as to offend you , i entreat your forgiveness of what i can assure you to have been perfectly unintentional . i shall never reflect on my former acquaintance with your family in devonshire without the most grateful pleasure , and flatter myself it will not be broken by any mistake or misapprehension of my actions . my esteem for your whole family is very sincere ; but if i have been so unfortunate as to give rise to a belief of more than i felt , or meant to express , i shall reproach myself for not having been more guarded in my professions of that esteem . that i should ever have meant more you will allow to be impossible , when you understand that my affections have been long engaged elsewhere , and it will not be many weeks , i believe , before this engagement is fulfilled . it is with great regret that i obey your commands in returning the letters with which i have been honoured from you , and the lock of hair , which you so obligingly bestowed on me .
austen	sense	“ i am , dear madam , “ your most obedient “ humble servant , “ john willoughby. ” with what indignation such a letter as this must be read by miss dashwood , may be imagined . though aware , before she began it , that it must bring a confession of his inconstancy , and confirm their separation for ever , she was not aware that such language could be suffered to announce it ; nor could she have supposed willoughby capable of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable and delicate feeling—so far from the common decorum of a gentleman , as to send a letter so impudently cruel : a letter which , instead of bringing with his desire of a release any professions of regret , acknowledged no breach of faith , denied all peculiar affection whatever—a letter of which every line was an insult , and which proclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy .
austen	sense	she paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment ; then read it again and again ; but every perusal only served to increase her abhorrence of the man , and so bitter were her feelings against him , that she dared not trust herself to speak , lest she might wound marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement , not as a loss to her of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and most irremediable of all evils , a connection , for life , with an unprincipled man , as a deliverance the most real , a blessing the most important .
austen	sense	in her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter , on the depravity of that mind which could dictate it , and probably , on the very different mind of a very different person , who had no other connection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with every thing that passed , elinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister , forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread , and so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room , that when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door , she went to the window to see who could be coming so unreasonably early , she was all astonishment to perceive mrs. jennings ’ s chariot , which she knew had not been ordered till one . determined not to quit marianne , though hopeless of contributing , at present , to her ease , she hurried away to excuse herself from attending mrs. jennings , on account of her sister being indisposed . mrs. jennings , with a thoroughly good-humoured concern for its cause , admitted the excuse most readily , and elinor , after seeing her safe off , returned to marianne , whom she found attempting to rise from the bed , and whom she reached just in time to prevent her from falling on the floor , faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest and food ; for it was many days since she had any appetite , and many nights since she had really slept ; and now , when her mind was no longer supported by the fever of suspense , the consequence of all this was felt in an aching head , a weakened stomach , and a general nervous faintness . a glass of wine , which elinor procured for her directly , made her more comfortable , and she was at last able to express some sense of her kindness , by saying ,
austen	sense	“ poor elinor ! how unhappy i make you ! ” “ i only wish , ” replied her sister , “ there were any thing i _could_ do , which might be of comfort to you. ” this , as every thing else would have been , was too much for marianne , who could only exclaim , in the anguish of her heart , “ oh ! elinor , i am miserable , indeed , ” before her voice was entirely lost in sobs .
austen	sense	elinor could no longer witness this torrent of unresisted grief in silence . “ exert yourself , dear marianne , ” she cried , “ if you would not kill yourself and all who love you . think of your mother ; think of her misery while _you_ suffer : for her sake you must exert yourself . ”
austen	sense	“ i can not , i can not , ” cried marianne ; “ leave me , leave me , if i distress you ; leave me , hate me , forget me ! but do not torture me so . oh ! how easy for those , who have no sorrow of their own to talk of exertion ! happy , happy elinor , _you_ can not have an idea of what i suffer . ”
austen	sense	“ do you call _me_ happy , marianne ? ah ! if you knew ! —and can you believe me to be so , while i see you so wretched ! ” “ forgive me , forgive me , ” throwing her arms round her sister ’ s neck ; “ i know you feel for me ; i know what a heart you have ; but yet you are—you must be happy ; edward loves you—what , oh what , can do away such happiness as that ? ”
austen	sense	“ many , many circumstances , ” said elinor , solemnly . “ no , no , no , ” cried marianne wildly , “ he loves you , and only you . you _can_ have no grief. ” “ i can have no pleasure while i see you in this state . ”
austen	sense	“ and you will never see me otherwise . mine is a misery which nothing can do away. ” “ you must not talk so , marianne . have you no comforts ? no friends ? is your loss such as leaves no opening for consolation ? much as you suffer now , think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of his character had been delayed to a later period—if your engagement had been carried on for months and months , as it might have been , before he chose to put an end to it . every additional day of unhappy confidence , on your side , would have made the blow more dreadful . ”
austen	sense	“ engagement ! ” cried marianne , “ there has been no engagement. ” “ no engagement ! ” “ no , he is not so unworthy as you believe him . he has broken no faith with me. ” “ but he told you that he loved you . ”
austen	sense	“ yes—no—never absolutely . it was every day implied , but never professedly declared . sometimes i thought it had been , but it never was. ” “ yet you wrote to him ? ” “ yes : could that be wrong after all that had passed ? but i can not talk . ”
austen	sense	elinor said no more , and turning again to the three letters which now raised a much stronger curiosity than before , directly ran over the contents of all . the first , which was what her sister had sent him on their arrival in town , was to this effect .
austen	sense	berkeley street , january . “ how surprised you will be , willoughby , on receiving this ; and i think you will feel something more than surprise , when you know that i am in town . an opportunity of coming hither , though with mrs. jennings , was a temptation we could not resist . i wish you may receive this in time to come here to-night , but i will not depend on it . at any rate i shall expect you to-morrow . for the present , adieu .
austen	sense	“ m.d. ” her second note , which had been written on the morning after the dance at the middletons ’ , was in these words : — “ i can not express my disappointment in having missed you the day before yesterday , nor my astonishment at not having received any answer to a note which i sent you above a week ago . i have been expecting to hear from you , and still more to see you , every hour of the day . pray call again as soon as possible , and explain the reason of my having expected this in vain . you had better come earlier another time , because we are generally out by one . we were last night at lady middleton ’ s , where there was a dance . i have been told that you were asked to be of the party . but could it be so ? you must be very much altered indeed since we parted , if that could be the case , and you not there . but i will not suppose this possible , and i hope very soon to receive your personal assurance of its being otherwise .
austen	sense	“ m.d. ” the contents of her last note to him were these : — “ what am i to imagine , willoughby , by your behaviour last night ? again i demand an explanation of it . i was prepared to meet you with the pleasure which our separation naturally produced , with the familiarity which our intimacy at barton appeared to me to justify . i was repulsed indeed ! i have passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse a conduct which can scarcely be called less than insulting ; but though i have not yet been able to form any reasonable apology for your behaviour , i am perfectly ready to hear your justification of it . you have perhaps been misinformed , or purposely deceived , in something concerning me , which may have lowered me in your opinion . tell me what it is , explain the grounds on which you acted , and i shall be satisfied , in being able to satisfy you . it would grieve me indeed to be obliged to think ill of you ; but if i am to do it , if i am to learn that you are not what we have hitherto believed you , that your regard for us all was insincere , that your behaviour to me was intended only to deceive , let it be told as soon as possible . my feelings are at present in a state of dreadful indecision ; i wish to acquit you , but certainty on either side will be ease to what i now suffer . if your sentiments are no longer what they were , you will return my notes , and the lock of my hair which is in your possession .
austen	sense	“ m.d. ” that such letters , so full of affection and confidence , could have been so answered , elinor , for willoughby ’ s sake , would have been unwilling to believe . but her condemnation of him did not blind her to the impropriety of their having been written at all ; and she was silently grieving over the imprudence which had hazarded such unsolicited proofs of tenderness , not warranted by anything preceding , and most severely condemned by the event , when marianne , perceiving that she had finished the letters , observed to her that they contained nothing but what any one would have written in the same situation .
austen	sense	“ i felt myself , ” she added , “ to be as solemnly engaged to him , as if the strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other. ” “ i can believe it , ” said elinor ; “ but unfortunately he did not feel the same . ”
austen	sense	“ he _did_ feel the same , elinor—for weeks and weeks he felt it . i know he did . whatever may have changed him now , ( and nothing but the blackest art employed against me can have done it ) , i was once as dear to him as my own soul could wish . this lock of hair , which now he can so readily give up , was begged of me with the most earnest supplication . had you seen his look , his manner , had you heard his voice at that moment ! have you forgot the last evening of our being together at barton ? the morning that we parted too ! when he told me that it might be many weeks before we met again—his distress—can i ever forget his distress ? ”
austen	sense	for a moment or two she could say no more ; but when this emotion had passed away , she added , in a firmer tone , “ elinor , i have been cruelly used ; but not by willoughby . ”
austen	sense	“ dearest marianne , who but himself ? by whom can he have been instigated ? ” “ by all the world , rather than by his own heart . i could rather believe every creature of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin me in his opinion , than believe his nature capable of such cruelty . this woman of whom he writes—whoever she be—or any one , in short , but your own dear self , mama , and edward , may have been so barbarous to bely me . beyond you three , is there a creature in the world whom i would not rather suspect of evil than willoughby , whose heart i know so well ? ”
austen	sense	elinor would not contend , and only replied , “ whoever may have been so detestably your enemy , let them be cheated of their malignant triumph , my dear sister , by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own innocence and good intentions supports your spirits . it is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence . ”
austen	sense	“ no , no , ” cried marianne , “ misery such as mine has no pride . i care not who knows that i am wretched . the triumph of seeing me so may be open to all the world . elinor , elinor , they who suffer little may be proud and independent as they like—may resist insult , or return mortification—but i can not . i must feel—i must be wretched—and they are welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can . ”
austen	sense	“ but for my mother ’ s sake and mine— ” “ i would do more than for my own . but to appear happy when i am so miserable—oh ! who can require it ? ” again they were both silent . elinor was employed in walking thoughtfully from the fire to the window , from the window to the fire , without knowing that she received warmth from one , or discerning objects through the other ; and marianne , seated at the foot of the bed , with her head leaning against one of its posts , again took up willoughby ’ s letter , and , after shuddering over every sentence , exclaimed , —
austen	sense	“ it is too much ! oh , willoughby , willoughby , could this be yours ! cruel , cruel—nothing can acquit you . elinor , nothing can . whatever he might have heard against me—ought he not to have suspended his belief ? ought he not to have told me of it , to have given me the power of clearing myself ? ‘ the lock of hair , ( repeating it from the letter , ) which you so obligingly bestowed on me ’ —that is unpardonable . willoughby , where was your heart when you wrote those words ? oh , barbarously insolent ! —elinor , can he be justified ? ”
austen	sense	“ no , marianne , in no possible way. ” “ and yet this woman—who knows what her art may have been ? —how long it may have been premeditated , and how deeply contrived by her ! —who is she ? —who can she be ? —whom did i ever hear him talk of as young and attractive among his female acquaintance ? —oh ! no one , no one—he talked to me only of myself . ”
austen	sense	another pause ensued ; marianne was greatly agitated , and it ended thus . “ elinor , i must go home . i must go and comfort mama . can not we be gone to-morrow ? ” “ to-morrow , marianne ! ”
austen	sense	“ yes , why should i stay here ? i came only for willoughby ’ s sake—and now who cares for me ? who regards me ? ” “ it would be impossible to go to-morrow . we owe mrs. jennings much more than civility ; and civility of the commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal as that . ”
austen	sense	“ well then , another day or two , perhaps ; but i can not stay here long , i can not stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people . the middletons and palmers—how am i to bear their pity ? the pity of such a woman as lady middleton ! oh , what would _he_ say to that ! ”
austen	sense	elinor advised her to lie down again , and for a moment she did so ; but no attitude could give her ease ; and in restless pain of mind and body she moved from one posture to another , till growing more and more hysterical , her sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at all , and for some time was fearful of being constrained to call for assistance . some lavender drops , however , which she was at length persuaded to take , were of use ; and from that time till mrs. jennings returned , she continued on the bed quiet and motionless .
austen	sense	chapter xxx . mrs. jennings came immediately to their room on her return , and without waiting to have her request of admittance answered , opened the door and walked in with a look of real concern .
austen	sense	“ how do you do my dear ? ” —said she in a voice of great compassion to marianne , who turned away her face without attempting to answer . “ how is she , miss dashwood ? poor thing ! she looks very bad . no wonder . ay , it is but too true . he is to be married very soon—a good-for-nothing fellow ! i have no patience with him . mrs. taylor told me of it half an hour ago , and she was told it by a particular friend of miss grey herself , else i am sure i should not have believed it ; and i was almost ready to sink as it was . well , said i , all i can say is , that if this be true , he has used a young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill , and i wish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out . and so i shall always say , my dear , you may depend on it . i have no notion of men ’ s going on in this way ; and if ever i meet him again , i will give him such a dressing as he has not had this many a day . but there is one comfort , my dear miss marianne ; he is not the only young man in the world worth having ; and with your pretty face you will never want admirers . well , poor thing ! i won ’ t disturb her any longer , for she had better have her cry out at once and have done with . the parrys and sandersons luckily are coming tonight you know , and that will amuse her . ”
austen	sense	she then went away , walking on tiptoe out of the room , as if she supposed her young friend ’ s affliction could be increased by noise . marianne , to the surprise of her sister , determined on dining with them . elinor even advised her against it . but “ no , she would go down ; she could bear it very well , and the bustle about her would be less. ” elinor , pleased to have her governed for a moment by such a motive , though believing it hardly possible that she could sit out the dinner , said no more ; and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could , while marianne still remained on the bed , was ready to assist her into the dining room as soon as they were summoned to it .
austen	sense	when there , though looking most wretchedly , she ate more and was calmer than her sister had expected . had she tried to speak , or had she been conscious of half mrs. jennings ’ s well-meant but ill-judged attentions to her , this calmness could not have been maintained ; but not a syllable escaped her lips ; and the abstraction of her thoughts preserved her in ignorance of every thing that was passing before her .
austen	sense	elinor , who did justice to mrs. jennings ’ s kindness , though its effusions were often distressing , and sometimes almost ridiculous , made her those acknowledgments , and returned her those civilities , which her sister could not make or return for herself . their good friend saw that marianne was unhappy , and felt that every thing was due to her which might make her at all less so . she treated her therefore , with all the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a favourite child on the last day of its holidays . marianne was to have the best place by the fire , was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house , and to be amused by the relation of all the news of the day . had not elinor , in the sad countenance of her sister , seen a check to all mirth , she could have been entertained by mrs. jennings ’ s endeavours to cure a disappointment in love , by a variety of sweetmeats and olives , and a good fire . as soon , however , as the consciousness of all this was forced by continual repetition on marianne , she could stay no longer . with a hasty exclamation of misery , and a sign to her sister not to follow her , she directly got up and hurried out of the room .
austen	sense	“ poor soul ! ” cried mrs. jennings , as soon as she was gone , “ how it grieves me to see her ! and i declare if she is not gone away without finishing her wine ! and the dried cherries too ! lord ! nothing seems to do her any good . i am sure if i knew of any thing she would like , i would send all over the town for it . well , it is the oddest thing to me , that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill ! but when there is plenty of money on one side , and next to none on the other , lord bless you ! they care no more about such things ! — ”
austen	sense	“ the lady then—miss grey i think you called her—is very rich ? ” “ fifty thousand pounds , my dear . did you ever see her ? a smart , stylish girl they say , but not handsome . i remember her aunt very well , biddy henshawe ; she married a very wealthy man . but the family are all rich together . fifty thousand pounds ! and by all accounts , it won ’ t come before it ’ s wanted ; for they say he is all to pieces . no wonder ! dashing about with his curricle and hunters ! well , it don ’ t signify talking ; but when a young man , be who he will , comes and makes love to a pretty girl , and promises marriage , he has no business to fly off from his word only because he grows poor , and a richer girl is ready to have him . why don ’ t he , in such a case , sell his horses , let his house , turn off his servants , and make a thorough reform at once ? i warrant you , miss marianne would have been ready to wait till matters came round . but that won ’ t do now-a-days ; nothing in the way of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age . ”
austen	sense	“ do you know what kind of a girl miss grey is ? is she said to be amiable ? ” “ i never heard any harm of her ; indeed i hardly ever heard her mentioned ; except that mrs. taylor did say this morning , that one day miss walker hinted to her , that she believed mr. and mrs. ellison would not be sorry to have miss grey married , for she and mrs. ellison could never agree . ”
austen	sense	“ and who are the ellisons ? ” “ her guardians , my dear . but now she is of age and may choose for herself ; and a pretty choice she has made ! —what now , ” after pausing a moment— “ your poor sister is gone to her own room , i suppose , to moan by herself . is there nothing one can get to comfort her ? poor dear , it seems quite cruel to let her be alone . well , by-and-by we shall have a few friends , and that will amuse her a little . what shall we play at ? she hates whist i know ; but is there no round game she cares for ? ”
austen	sense	“ dear ma ’ am , this kindness is quite unnecessary . marianne , i dare say , will not leave her room again this evening . i shall persuade her if i can to go early to bed , for i am sure she wants rest . ”
austen	sense	“ aye , i believe that will be best for her . let her name her own supper , and go to bed . lord ! no wonder she has been looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two , for this matter i suppose has been hanging over her head as long as that . and so the letter that came today finished it ! poor soul ! i am sure if i had had a notion of it , i would not have joked her about it for all my money . but then you know , how should i guess such a thing ? i made sure of its being nothing but a common love letter , and you know young people like to be laughed at about them . lord ! how concerned sir john and my daughters will be when they hear it ! if i had my senses about me i might have called in conduit street in my way home , and told them of it . but i shall see them tomorrow . ”
austen	sense	“ it would be unnecessary i am sure , for you to caution mrs. palmer and sir john against ever naming mr. willoughby , or making the slightest allusion to what has passed , before my sister . their own good-nature must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing about it when she is present ; and the less that may ever be said to myself on the subject , the more my feelings will be spared , as you my dear madam will easily believe . ”
austen	sense	“ oh ! lord ! yes , that i do indeed . it must be terrible for you to hear it talked of ; and as for your sister , i am sure i would not mention a word about it to her for the world . you saw i did not all dinner time . no more would sir john , nor my daughters , for they are all very thoughtful and considerate ; especially if i give them a hint , as i certainly will . for my part , i think the less that is said about such things , the better , the sooner ’ tis blown over and forgot . and what good does talking ever do you know ? ”
austen	sense	“ in this affair it can only do harm ; more so perhaps than in many cases of a similar kind , for it has been attended by circumstances which , for the sake of every one concerned in it , make it unfit to become the public conversation . i must do _this_ justice to mr. willoughby—he has broken no positive engagement with my sister . ”
austen	sense	“ law , my dear ! don ’ t pretend to defend him . no positive engagement indeed ! after taking her all over allenham house , and fixing on the very rooms they were to live in hereafter ! ”
austen	sense	elinor , for her sister ’ s sake , could not press the subject farther , and she hoped it was not required of her for willoughby ’ s ; since , though marianne might lose much , he could gain very little by the enforcement of the real truth . after a short silence on both sides , mrs. jennings , with all her natural hilarity , burst forth again .
austen	sense	“ well , my dear , ’ tis a true saying about an ill-wind , for it will be all the better for colonel brandon . he will have her at last ; aye , that he will . mind me , now , if they an ’ t married by mid-summer . lord ! how he ’ ll chuckle over this news ! i hope he will come tonight . it will be all to one a better match for your sister . two thousand a year without debt or drawback—except the little love-child , indeed ; aye , i had forgot her ; but she may be ’ prenticed out at a small cost , and then what does it signify ? delaford is a nice place , i can tell you ; exactly what i call a nice old fashioned place , full of comforts and conveniences ; quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered with the best fruit-trees in the country ; and such a mulberry tree in one corner ! lord ! how charlotte and i did stuff the only time we were there ! then , there is a dove-cote , some delightful stew-ponds , and a very pretty canal ; and every thing , in short , that one could wish for ; and , moreover , it is close to the church , and only a quarter of a mile from the turnpike-road , so ’ tis never dull , for if you only go and sit up in an old yew arbour behind the house , you may see all the carriages that pass along . oh ! ’ tis a nice place ! a butcher hard by in the village , and the parsonage-house within a stone ’ s throw . to my fancy , a thousand times prettier than barton park , where they are forced to send three miles for their meat , and have not a neighbour nearer than your mother . well , i shall spirit up the colonel as soon as i can . one shoulder of mutton , you know , drives another down . if we _can_ but put willoughby out of her head ! ”
austen	sense	“ ay , if we can do _that_ , ma ’ am , ” said elinor , “ we shall do very well with or without colonel brandon. ” and then rising , she went away to join marianne , whom she found , as she expected , in her own room , leaning , in silent misery , over the small remains of a fire , which , till elinor ’ s entrance , had been her only light .
austen	sense	“ you had better leave me , ” was all the notice that her sister received from her . “ i will leave you , ” said elinor , “ if you will go to bed. ” but this , from the momentary perverseness of impatient suffering , she at first refused to do . her sister ’ s earnest , though gentle persuasion , however , soon softened her to compliance , and elinor saw her lay her aching head on the pillow , and as she hoped , in a way to get some quiet rest before she left her .
austen	sense	in the drawing-room , whither she then repaired , she was soon joined by mrs. jennings , with a wine-glass , full of something , in her hand . “ my dear , ” said she , entering , “ i have just recollected that i have some of the finest old constantia wine in the house that ever was tasted , so i have brought a glass of it for your sister . my poor husband ! how fond he was of it ! whenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout , he said it did him more good than any thing else in the world . do take it to your sister . ”
austen	sense	“ dear ma ’ am , ” replied elinor , smiling at the difference of the complaints for which it was recommended , “ how good you are ! but i have just left marianne in bed , and , i hope , almost asleep ; and as i think nothing will be of so much service to her as rest , if you will give me leave , i will drink the wine myself . ”
austen	sense	mrs. jennings , though regretting that she had not been five minutes earlier , was satisfied with the compromise ; and elinor , as she swallowed the chief of it , reflected , that though its effects on a colicky gout were , at present , of little importance to her , its healing powers , on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried on herself as on her sister .
austen	sense	colonel brandon came in while the party were at tea , and by his manner of looking round the room for marianne , elinor immediately fancied that he neither expected nor wished to see her there , and , in short , that he was already aware of what occasioned her absence . mrs. jennings was not struck by the same thought ; for soon after his entrance , she walked across the room to the tea-table where elinor presided , and whispered , “ the colonel looks as grave as ever you see . he knows nothing of it ; do tell him , my dear . ”
austen	sense	he shortly afterwards drew a chair close to hers , and , with a look which perfectly assured her of his good information , inquired after her sister . “ marianne is not well , ” said she . “ she has been indisposed all day , and we have persuaded her to go to bed . ”
austen	sense	“ perhaps , then , ” he hesitatingly replied , “ what i heard this morning may be—there may be more truth in it than i could believe possible at first. ” “ what did you hear ? ” “ that a gentleman , whom i had reason to think—in short , that a man , whom i _knew_ to be engaged—but how shall i tell you ? if you know it already , as surely you must , i may be spared . ”
austen	sense	“ you mean , ” answered elinor , with forced calmness , “ mr . willoughby ’ s marriage with miss grey . yes , we _do_ know it all . this seems to have been a day of general elucidation , for this very morning first unfolded it to us . mr. willoughby is unfathomable ! where did you hear it ? ”
austen	sense	“ in a stationer ’ s shop in pall mall , where i had business . two ladies were waiting for their carriage , and one of them was giving the other an account of the intended match , in a voice so little attempting concealment , that it was impossible for me not to hear all . the name of willoughby , john willoughby , frequently repeated , first caught my attention ; and what followed was a positive assertion that every thing was now finally settled respecting his marriage with miss grey—it was no longer to be a secret—it would take place even within a few weeks , with many particulars of preparations and other matters . one thing , especially , i remember , because it served to identify the man still more : —as soon as the ceremony was over , they were to go to combe magna , his seat in somersetshire . my astonishment ! —but it would be impossible to describe what i felt . the communicative lady i learnt , on inquiry , for i stayed in the shop till they were gone , was a mrs. ellison , and that , as i have been since informed , is the name of miss grey ’ s guardian . ”
austen	sense	“ it is . but have you likewise heard that miss grey has fifty thousand pounds ? in that , if in any thing , we may find an explanation. ” “ it may be so ; but willoughby is capable—at least i think ” —he stopped a moment ; then added in a voice which seemed to distrust itself , “ and your sister—how did she— ”
austen	sense	“ her sufferings have been very severe . i have only to hope that they may be proportionately short . it has been , it is a most cruel affliction . till yesterday , i believe , she never doubted his regard ; and even now , perhaps—but _i_ am almost convinced that he never was really attached to her . he has been very deceitful ! and , in some points , there seems a hardness of heart about him . ”
austen	sense	“ ah ! ” said colonel brandon , “ there is , indeed ! but your sister does not—i think you said so—she does not consider quite as you do ? ” “ you know her disposition , and may believe how eagerly she would still justify him if she could . ”
austen	sense	he made no answer ; and soon afterwards , by the removal of the tea-things , and the arrangement of the card parties , the subject was necessarily dropped . mrs. jennings , who had watched them with pleasure while they were talking , and who expected to see the effect of miss dashwood ’ s communication , in such an instantaneous gaiety on colonel brandon ’ s side , as might have become a man in the bloom of youth , of hope and happiness , saw him , with amazement , remain the whole evening more serious and thoughtful than usual .
austen	sense	chapter xxxi . from a night of more sleep than she had expected , marianne awoke the next morning to the same consciousness of misery in which she had closed her eyes .
austen	sense	elinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk of what she felt ; and before breakfast was ready , they had gone through the subject again and again ; and with the same steady conviction and affectionate counsel on elinor ’ s side , the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on marianne ’ s , as before . sometimes she could believe willoughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself , and at others , lost every consolation in the impossibility of acquitting him . at one moment she was absolutely indifferent to the observation of all the world , at another she would seclude herself from it for ever , and at a third could resist it with energy . in one thing , however , she was uniform , when it came to the point , in avoiding , where it was possible , the presence of mrs. jennings , and in a determined silence when obliged to endure it . her heart was hardened against the belief of mrs. jennings ’ s entering into her sorrows with any compassion .
austen	sense	“ no , no , no , it can not be , ” she cried ; “ she can not feel . her kindness is not sympathy ; her good-nature is not tenderness . all that she wants is gossip , and she only likes me now because i supply it . ”
austen	sense	elinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice to which her sister was often led in her opinion of others , by the irritable refinement of her own mind , and the too great importance placed by her on the delicacies of a strong sensibility , and the graces of a polished manner . like half the rest of the world , if more than half there be that are clever and good , marianne , with excellent abilities and an excellent disposition , was neither reasonable nor candid . she expected from other people the same opinions and feelings as her own , and she judged of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions on herself . thus a circumstance occurred , while the sisters were together in their own room after breakfast , which sunk the heart of mrs. jennings still lower in her estimation ; because , through her own weakness , it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself , though mrs. jennings was governed in it by an impulse of the utmost goodwill .
austen	sense	with a letter in her outstretched hand , and countenance gaily smiling , from the persuasion of bringing comfort , she entered their room , saying , “ now , my dear , i bring you something that i am sure will do you good . ”
austen	sense	marianne heard enough . in one moment her imagination placed before her a letter from willoughby , full of tenderness and contrition , explanatory of all that had passed , satisfactory , convincing ; and instantly followed by willoughby himself , rushing eagerly into the room to inforce , at her feet , by the eloquence of his eyes , the assurances of his letter . the work of one moment was destroyed by the next . the hand writing of her mother , never till then unwelcome , was before her ; and , in the acuteness of the disappointment which followed such an ecstasy of more than hope , she felt as if , till that instant , she had never suffered .
austen	sense	the cruelty of mrs. jennings no language , within her reach in her moments of happiest eloquence , could have expressed ; and now she could reproach her only by the tears which streamed from her eyes with passionate violence—a reproach , however , so entirely lost on its object , that after many expressions of pity , she withdrew , still referring her to the letter of comfort . but the letter , when she was calm enough to read it , brought little comfort . willoughby filled every page . her mother , still confident of their engagement , and relying as warmly as ever on his constancy , had only been roused by elinor ’ s application , to intreat from marianne greater openness towards them both ; and this , with such tenderness towards her , such affection for willoughby , and such a conviction of their future happiness in each other , that she wept with agony through the whole of it .
austen	sense	all her impatience to be at home again now returned ; her mother was dearer to her than ever ; dearer through the very excess of her mistaken confidence in willoughby , and she was wildly urgent to be gone . elinor , unable herself to determine whether it were better for marianne to be in london or at barton , offered no counsel of her own except of patience till their mother ’ s wishes could be known ; and at length she obtained her sister ’ s consent to wait for that knowledge .
austen	sense	mrs. jennings left them earlier than usual ; for she could not be easy till the middletons and palmers were able to grieve as much as herself ; and positively refusing elinor ’ s offered attendance , went out alone for the rest of the morning . elinor , with a very heavy heart , aware of the pain she was going to communicate , and perceiving , by marianne ’ s letter , how ill she had succeeded in laying any foundation for it , then sat down to write her mother an account of what had passed , and entreat her directions for the future ; while marianne , who came into the drawing-room on mrs. jennings ’ s going away , remained fixed at the table where elinor wrote , watching the advancement of her pen , grieving over her for the hardship of such a task , and grieving still more fondly over its effect on her mother .
austen	sense	in this manner they had continued about a quarter of an hour , when marianne , whose nerves could not then bear any sudden noise , was startled by a rap at the door .
austen	sense	“ who can this be ? ” cried elinor . “ so early too ! i thought we _had_ been safe. ” marianne moved to the window . “ it is colonel brandon ! ” said she , with vexation . “ we are never safe from _him_ . ”
austen	sense	“ he will not come in , as mrs. jennings is from home. ” “ i will not trust to _that_ , ” retreating to her own room . “ a man who has nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on that of others . ”
austen	sense	the event proved her conjecture right , though it was founded on injustice and error ; for colonel brandon _did_ come in ; and elinor , who was convinced that solicitude for marianne brought him thither , and who saw _that_ solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look , and in his anxious though brief inquiry after her , could not forgive her sister for esteeming him so lightly .
austen	sense	“ i met mrs. jennings in bond street , ” said he , after the first salutation , “ and she encouraged me to come on ; and i was the more easily encouraged , because i thought it probable that i might find you alone , which i was very desirous of doing . my object—my wish—my sole wish in desiring it—i hope , i believe it is—is to be a means of giving comfort ; —no , i must not say comfort—not present comfort—but conviction , lasting conviction to your sister ’ s mind . my regard for her , for yourself , for your mother—will you allow me to prove it , by relating some circumstances which nothing but a _very_ sincere regard—nothing but an earnest desire of being useful—i think i am justified—though where so many hours have been spent in convincing myself that i am right , is there not some reason to fear i may be wrong ? ” he stopped .
austen	sense	“ i understand you , ” said elinor . “ you have something to tell me of mr. willoughby , that will open his character farther . your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship that can be shown marianne . _my_ gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to that end , and _hers_ must be gained by it in time . pray , pray let me hear it . ”
austen	sense	“ you shall ; and , to be brief , when i quitted barton last october , —but this will give you no idea—i must go farther back . you will find me a very awkward narrator , miss dashwood ; i hardly know where to begin . a short account of myself , i believe , will be necessary , and it _shall_ be a short one . on such a subject , ” sighing heavily , “ can i have little temptation to be diffuse . ”
austen	sense	he stopt a moment for recollection , and then , with another sigh , went on . “ you have probably entirely forgotten a conversation— ( it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression on you ) —a conversation between us one evening at barton park—it was the evening of a dance—in which i alluded to a lady i had once known , as resembling , in some measure , your sister marianne . ”
austen	sense	“ indeed , ” answered elinor , “ i have _not_ forgotten it. ” he looked pleased by this remembrance , and added , “ if i am not deceived by the uncertainty , the partiality of tender recollection , there is a very strong resemblance between them , as well in mind as person . the same warmth of heart , the same eagerness of fancy and spirits . this lady was one of my nearest relations , an orphan from her infancy , and under the guardianship of my father . our ages were nearly the same , and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends . i can not remember the time when i did not love eliza ; and my affection for her , as we grew up , was such , as perhaps , judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity , you might think me incapable of having ever felt . hers , for me , was , i believe , fervent as the attachment of your sister to mr. willoughby and it was , though from a different cause , no less unfortunate . at seventeen she was lost to me for ever . she was married—married against her inclination to my brother . her fortune was large , and our family estate much encumbered . and this , i fear , is all that can be said for the conduct of one , who was at once her uncle and guardian . my brother did not deserve her ; he did not even love her . i had hoped that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty , and for some time it did ; but at last the misery of her situation , for she experienced great unkindness , overcame all her resolution , and though she had promised me that nothing—but how blindly i relate ! i have never told you how this was brought on . we were within a few hours of eloping together for scotland . the treachery , or the folly , of my cousin ’ s maid betrayed us . i was banished to the house of a relation far distant , and she was allowed no liberty , no society , no amusement , till my father ’ s point was gained . i had depended on her fortitude too far , and the blow was a severe one—but had her marriage been happy , so young as i then was , a few months must have reconciled me to it , or at least i should not have now to lament it . this however was not the case . my brother had no regard for her ; his pleasures were not what they ought to have been , and from the first he treated her unkindly . the consequence of this , upon a mind so young , so lively , so inexperienced as mrs. brandon ’ s , was but too natural . she resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation ; and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned . but can we wonder that , with such a husband to provoke inconstancy , and without a friend to advise or restrain her ( for my father lived only a few months after their marriage , and i was with my regiment in the east indies ) she should fall ? had i remained in england , perhaps—but i meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years , and for that purpose had procured my exchange . the shock which her marriage had given me , ” he continued , in a voice of great agitation , “ was of trifling weight—was nothing to what i felt when i heard , about two years afterwards , of her divorce . it was _that_ which threw this gloom , —even now the recollection of what i suffered— ”
austen	sense	he could say no more , and rising hastily walked for a few minutes about the room . elinor , affected by his relation , and still more by his distress , could not speak . he saw her concern , and coming to her , took her hand , pressed it , and kissed it with grateful respect . a few minutes more of silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure .
austen	sense	“ it was nearly three years after this unhappy period before i returned to england . my first care , when i _did_ arrive , was of course to seek for her ; but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy . i could not trace her beyond her first seducer , and there was every reason to fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of sin . her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune , nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance , and i learnt from my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months before to another person . he imagined , and calmly could he imagine it , that her extravagance , and consequent distress , had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief . at last , however , and after i had been six months in england , i _did_ find her . regard for a former servant of my own , who had since fallen into misfortune , carried me to visit him in a spunging-house , where he was confined for debt ; and there , in the same house , under a similar confinement , was my unfortunate sister . so altered—so faded—worn down by acute suffering of every kind ! hardly could i believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me , to be the remains of the lovely , blooming , healthful girl , on whom i had once doted . what i endured in so beholding her—but i have no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it—i have pained you too much already . that she was , to all appearance , in the last stage of a consumption , was—yes , in such a situation it was my greatest comfort . life could do nothing for her , beyond giving time for a better preparation for death ; and that was given . i saw her placed in comfortable lodgings , and under proper attendants ; i visited her every day during the rest of her short life : i was with her in her last moments . ”
austen	sense	again he stopped to recover himself ; and elinor spoke her feelings in an exclamation of tender concern , at the fate of his unfortunate friend . “ your sister , i hope , can not be offended , ” said he , “ by the resemblance i have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation . their fates , their fortunes , can not be the same ; and had the natural sweet disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind , or a happier marriage , she might have been all that you will live to see the other be . but to what does all this lead ? i seem to have been distressing you for nothing . ah ! miss dashwood—a subject such as this—untouched for fourteen years—it is dangerous to handle it at all ! i _will_ be more collected—more concise . she left to my care her only child , a little girl , the offspring of her first guilty connection , who was then about three years old . she loved the child , and had always kept it with her . it was a valued , a precious trust to me ; and gladly would i have discharged it in the strictest sense , by watching over her education myself , had the nature of our situations allowed it ; but i had no family , no home ; and my little eliza was therefore placed at school . i saw her there whenever i could , and after the death of my brother , ( which happened about five years ago , and which left to me the possession of the family property , ) she visited me at delaford . i called her a distant relation ; but i am well aware that i have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her . it is now three years ago ( she had just reached her fourteenth year , ) that i removed her from school , to place her under the care of a very respectable woman , residing in dorsetshire , who had the charge of four or five other girls of about the same time of life ; and for two years i had every reason to be pleased with her situation . but last february , almost a twelvemonth back , she suddenly disappeared . i had allowed her , ( imprudently , as it has since turned out , ) at her earnest desire , to go to bath with one of her young friends , who was attending her father there for his health . i knew him to be a very good sort of man , and i thought well of his daughter—better than she deserved , for , with a most obstinate and ill-judged secrecy , she would tell nothing , would give no clue , though she certainly knew all . he , her father , a well-meaning , but not a quick-sighted man , could really , i believe , give no information ; for he had been generally confined to the house , while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose ; and he tried to convince me , as thoroughly as he was convinced himself , of his daughter ’ s being entirely unconcerned in the business . in short , i could learn nothing but that she was gone ; all the rest , for eight long months , was left to conjecture . what i thought , what i feared , may be imagined ; and what i suffered too . ”
austen	sense	“ good heavens ! ” cried elinor , “ could it be—could willoughby ! ” — “ the first news that reached me of her , ” he continued , “ came in a letter from herself , last october . it was forwarded to me from delaford , and i received it on the very morning of our intended party to whitwell ; and this was the reason of my leaving barton so suddenly , which i am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body , and which i believe gave offence to some . little did mr. willoughby imagine , i suppose , when his looks censured me for incivility in breaking up the party , that i was called away to the relief of one whom he had made poor and miserable ; but _had_ he known it , what would it have availed ? would he have been less gay or less happy in the smiles of your sister ? no , he had already done that , which no man who _can_ feel for another would do . he had left the girl whose youth and innocence he had seduced , in a situation of the utmost distress , with no creditable home , no help , no friends , ignorant of his address ! he had left her , promising to return ; he neither returned , nor wrote , nor relieved her . ”
austen	sense	“ this is beyond every thing ! ” exclaimed elinor . “ his character is now before you ; expensive , dissipated , and worse than both . knowing all this , as i have now known it many weeks , guess what i must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever , and on being assured that she was to marry him : guess what i must have felt for all your sakes . when i came to you last week and found you alone , i came determined to know the truth ; though irresolute what to do when it _was_ known . my behaviour must have seemed strange to you then ; but now you will comprehend it . to suffer you all to be so deceived ; to see your sister—but what could i do ? i had no hope of interfering with success ; and sometimes i thought your sister ’ s influence might yet reclaim him . but now , after such dishonorable usage , who can tell what were his designs on her . whatever they may have been , however , she may now , and hereafter doubtless _will_ turn with gratitude towards her own condition , when she compares it with that of my poor eliza , when she considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl , and pictures her to herself , with an affection for him so strong , still as strong as her own , and with a mind tormented by self-reproach , which must attend her through life . surely this comparison must have its use with her . she will feel her own sufferings to be nothing . they proceed from no misconduct , and can bring no disgrace . on the contrary , every friend must be made still more her friend by them . concern for her unhappiness , and respect for her fortitude under it , must strengthen every attachment . use your own discretion , however , in communicating to her what i have told you . you must know best what will be its effect ; but had i not seriously , and from my heart believed it might be of service , might lessen her regrets , i would not have suffered myself to trouble you with this account of my family afflictions , with a recital which may seem to have been intended to raise myself at the expense of others . ”
austen	sense	elinor ’ s thanks followed this speech with grateful earnestness ; attended too with the assurance of her expecting material advantage to marianne , from the communication of what had passed . “ i have been more pained , ” said she , “ by her endeavors to acquit him than by all the rest ; for it irritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do . now , though at first she will suffer much , i am sure she will soon become easier . have you , ” she continued , after a short silence , “ ever seen mr. willoughby since you left him at barton ? ”
austen	sense	“ yes , ” he replied gravely , “ once i have . one meeting was unavoidable. ” elinor , startled by his manner , looked at him anxiously , saying , “ what ? have you met him to— ” “ i could meet him no other way . eliza had confessed to me , though most reluctantly , the name of her lover ; and when he returned to town , which was within a fortnight after myself , we met by appointment , he to defend , i to punish his conduct . we returned unwounded , and the meeting , therefore , never got abroad . ”
austen	sense	elinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this ; but to a man and a soldier she presumed not to censure it . “ such , ” said colonel brandon , after a pause , “ has been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother and daughter ! and so imperfectly have i discharged my trust ! ”
austen	sense	“ is she still in town ? ” “ no ; as soon as she recovered from her lying-in , for i found her near her delivery , i removed her and her child into the country , and there she remains . ”
austen	sense	recollecting , soon afterwards , that he was probably dividing elinor from her sister , he put an end to his visit , receiving from her again the same grateful acknowledgments , and leaving her full of compassion and esteem for him .
austen	sense	chapter xxxii . when the particulars of this conversation were repeated by miss dashwood to her sister , as they very soon were , the effect on her was not entirely such as the former had hoped to see . not that marianne appeared to distrust the truth of any part of it , for she listened to it all with the most steady and submissive attention , made neither objection nor remark , attempted no vindication of willoughby , and seemed to show by her tears that she felt it to be impossible . but though this behaviour assured elinor that the conviction of this guilt _was_ carried home to her mind , though she saw with satisfaction the effect of it , in her no longer avoiding colonel brandon when he called , in her speaking to him , even voluntarily speaking , with a kind of compassionate respect , and though she saw her spirits less violently irritated than before , she did not see her less wretched . her mind did become settled , but it was settled in a gloomy dejection . she felt the loss of willoughby ’ s character yet more heavily than she had felt the loss of his heart ; his seduction and desertion of miss williams , the misery of that poor girl , and the doubt of what his designs might _once_ have been on herself , preyed altogether so much on her spirits , that she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt even to elinor ; and , brooding over her sorrows in silence , gave more pain to her sister than could have been communicated by the most open and most frequent confession of them .
austen	sense	to give the feelings or the language of mrs. dashwood on receiving and answering elinor ’ s letter would be only to give a repetition of what her daughters had already felt and said ; of a disappointment hardly less painful than marianne ’ s , and an indignation even greater than elinor ’ s . long letters from her , quickly succeeding each other , arrived to tell all that she suffered and thought ; to express her anxious solicitude for marianne , and entreat she would bear up with fortitude under this misfortune . bad indeed must the nature of marianne ’ s affliction be , when her mother could talk of fortitude ! mortifying and humiliating must be the origin of those regrets , which _she_ could wish her not to indulge !
austen	sense	against the interest of her own individual comfort , mrs. dashwood had determined that it would be better for marianne to be any where , at that time , than at barton , where every thing within her view would be bringing back the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner , by constantly placing willoughby before her , such as she had always seen him there . she recommended it to her daughters , therefore , by all means not to shorten their visit to mrs. jennings ; the length of which , though never exactly fixed , had been expected by all to comprise at least five or six weeks . a variety of occupations , of objects , and of company , which could not be procured at barton , would be inevitable there , and might yet , she hoped , cheat marianne , at times , into some interest beyond herself , and even into some amusement , much as the ideas of both might now be spurned by her .
austen	sense	from all danger of seeing willoughby again , her mother considered her to be at least equally safe in town as in the country , since his acquaintance must now be dropped by all who called themselves her friends . design could never bring them in each other ’ s way : negligence could never leave them exposed to a surprise ; and chance had less in its favour in the crowd of london than even in the retirement of barton , where it might force him before her while paying that visit at allenham on his marriage , which mrs. dashwood , from foreseeing at first as a probable event , had brought herself to expect as a certain one .
austen	sense	she had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain where they were ; a letter from her son-in-law had told her that he and his wife were to be in town before the middle of february , and she judged it right that they should sometimes see their brother .
austen	sense	marianne had promised to be guided by her mother ’ s opinion , and she submitted to it therefore without opposition , though it proved perfectly different from what she wished and expected , though she felt it to be entirely wrong , formed on mistaken grounds , and that by requiring her longer continuance in london it deprived her of the only possible alleviation of her wretchedness , the personal sympathy of her mother , and doomed her to such society and such scenes as must prevent her ever knowing a moment ’ s rest .
austen	sense	but it was a matter of great consolation to her , that what brought evil to herself would bring good to her sister ; and elinor , on the other hand , suspecting that it would not be in her power to avoid edward entirely , comforted herself by thinking , that though their longer stay would therefore militate against her own happiness , it would be better for marianne than an immediate return into devonshire .
austen	sense	her carefulness in guarding her sister from ever hearing willoughby ’ s name mentioned , was not thrown away . marianne , though without knowing it herself , reaped all its advantage ; for neither mrs. jennings , nor sir john , nor even mrs. palmer herself , ever spoke of him before her . elinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended towards herself , but that was impossible , and she was obliged to listen day after day to the indignation of them all .
austen	sense	sir john , could not have thought it possible . “ a man of whom he had always had such reason to think well ! such a good-natured fellow ! he did not believe there was a bolder rider in england ! it was an unaccountable business . he wished him at the devil with all his heart . he would not speak another word to him , meet him where he might , for all the world ! no , not if it were to be by the side of barton covert , and they were kept watching for two hours together . such a scoundrel of a fellow ! such a deceitful dog ! it was only the last time they met that he had offered him one of folly ’ s puppies ! and this was the end of it ! ”
austen	sense	mrs. palmer , in her way , was equally angry . “ she was determined to drop his acquaintance immediately , and she was very thankful that she had never been acquainted with him at all . she wished with all her heart combe magna was not so near cleveland ; but it did not signify , for it was a great deal too far off to visit ; she hated him so much that she was resolved never to mention his name again , and she should tell everybody she saw , how good-for-nothing he was . ”
austen	sense	the rest of mrs. palmer ’ s sympathy was shown in procuring all the particulars in her power of the approaching marriage , and communicating them to elinor . she could soon tell at what coachmaker ’ s the new carriage was building , by what painter mr. willoughby ’ s portrait was drawn , and at what warehouse miss grey ’ s clothes might be seen .
austen	sense	the calm and polite unconcern of lady middleton on the occasion was a happy relief to elinor ’ s spirits , oppressed as they often were by the clamorous kindness of the others . it was a great comfort to her to be sure of exciting no interest in _one_ person at least among their circle of friends : a great comfort to know that there was _one_ who would meet her without feeling any curiosity after particulars , or any anxiety for her sister ’ s health .
austen	sense	every qualification is raised at times , by the circumstances of the moment , to more than its real value ; and she was sometimes worried down by officious condolence to rate good-breeding as more indispensable to comfort than good-nature .
austen	sense	lady middleton expressed her sense of the affair about once every day , or twice , if the subject occurred very often , by saying , “ it is very shocking , indeed ! ” and by the means of this continual though gentle vent , was able not only to see the miss dashwoods from the first without the smallest emotion , but very soon to see them without recollecting a word of the matter ; and having thus supported the dignity of her own sex , and spoken her decided censure of what was wrong in the other , she thought herself at liberty to attend to the interest of her own assemblies , and therefore determined ( though rather against the opinion of sir john ) that as mrs. willoughby would at once be a woman of elegance and fortune , to leave her card with her as soon as she married .
austen	sense	colonel brandon ’ s delicate , unobtrusive enquiries were never unwelcome to miss dashwood . he had abundantly earned the privilege of intimate discussion of her sister ’ s disappointment , by the friendly zeal with which he had endeavoured to soften it , and they always conversed with confidence . his chief reward for the painful exertion of disclosing past sorrows and present humiliations , was given in the pitying eye with which marianne sometimes observed him , and the gentleness of her voice whenever ( though it did not often happen ) she was obliged , or could oblige herself to speak to him . _these_ assured him that his exertion had produced an increase of good-will towards himself , and _these_ gave elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter ; but mrs. jennings , who knew nothing of all this , who knew only that the colonel continued as grave as ever , and that she could neither prevail on him to make the offer himself , nor commission her to make it for him , began , at the end of two days , to think that , instead of midsummer , they would not be married till michaelmas , and by the end of a week that it would not be a match at all . the good understanding between the colonel and miss dashwood seemed rather to declare that the honours of the mulberry-tree , the canal , and the yew arbour , would all be made over to _her ; _ and mrs. jennings had , for some time ceased to think at all of mrs. ferrars .
austen	sense	early in february , within a fortnight from the receipt of willoughby ’ s letter , elinor had the painful office of informing her sister that he was married . she had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed to herself , as soon as it was known that the ceremony was over , as she was desirous that marianne should not receive the first notice of it from the public papers , which she saw her eagerly examining every morning .
austen	sense	she received the news with resolute composure ; made no observation on it , and at first shed no tears ; but after a short time they would burst out , and for the rest of the day , she was in a state hardly less pitiable than when she first learnt to expect the event .
austen	sense	the willoughbys left town as soon as they were married ; and elinor now hoped , as there could be no danger of her seeing either of them , to prevail on her sister , who had never yet left the house since the blow first fell , to go out again by degrees as she had done before .
austen	sense	about this time the two miss steeles , lately arrived at their cousin ’ s house in bartlett ’ s buildings , holburn , presented themselves again before their more grand relations in conduit and berkeley streets ; and were welcomed by them all with great cordiality .
austen	sense	elinor only was sorry to see them . their presence always gave her pain , and she hardly knew how to make a very gracious return to the overpowering delight of lucy in finding her _still_ in town .
austen	sense	“ i should have been quite disappointed if i had not found you here _still_ , ” said she repeatedly , with a strong emphasis on the word . “ but i always thought i _should_ . i was almost sure you would not leave london yet awhile ; though you _told_ me , you know , at barton , that you should not stay above a _month_ . but i thought , at the time , that you would most likely change your mind when it came to the point . it would have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and sister came . and now to be sure you will be in no _hurry_ to be gone . i am amazingly glad you did not keep to _your word_ . ”
austen	sense	elinor perfectly understood her , and was forced to use all her self-command to make it appear that she did _not_ . “ well , my dear , ” said mrs. jennings , “ and how did you travel ? ”
austen	sense	“ not in the stage , i assure you , ” replied miss steele , with quick exultation ; “ we came post all the way , and had a very smart beau to attend us . dr. davies was coming to town , and so we thought we ’ d join him in a post-chaise ; and he behaved very genteelly , and paid ten or twelve shillings more than we did . ”
austen	sense	“ oh , oh ! ” cried mrs. jennings ; “ very pretty , indeed ! and the doctor is a single man , i warrant you. ” “ there now , ” said miss steele , affectedly simpering , “ everybody laughs at me so about the doctor , and i can not think why . my cousins say they are sure i have made a conquest ; but for my part i declare i never think about him from one hour ’ s end to another . ‘ lord ! here comes your beau , nancy , ’ my cousin said t ’ other day , when she saw him crossing the street to the house . my beau , indeed ! said i—i can not think who you mean . the doctor is no beau of mine . ”
austen	sense	“ aye , aye , that is very pretty talking—but it won ’ t do—the doctor is the man , i see. ” “ no , indeed ! ” replied her cousin , with affected earnestness , “ and i beg you will contradict it , if you ever hear it talked of . ”
austen	sense	mrs. jennings directly gave her the gratifying assurance that she certainly would _not_ , and miss steele was made completely happy . “ i suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister , miss dashwood , when they come to town , ” said lucy , returning , after a cessation of hostile hints , to the charge .
austen	sense	“ no , i do not think we shall. ” “ oh , yes , i dare say you will. ” elinor would not humour her by farther opposition . “ what a charming thing it is that mrs. dashwood can spare you both for so long a time together ! ”
austen	sense	“ long a time , indeed ! ” interposed mrs. jennings . “ why , their visit is but just begun ! ” lucy was silenced . “ i am sorry we can not see your sister , miss dashwood , ” said miss steele . “ i am sorry she is not well— ” for marianne had left the room on their arrival .
austen	sense	“ you are very good . my sister will be equally sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you ; but she has been very much plagued lately with nervous head-aches , which make her unfit for company or conversation . ”
austen	sense	“ oh , dear , that is a great pity ! but such old friends as lucy and me ! —i think she might see _us ; _ and i am sure we would not speak a word . ”
austen	sense	elinor , with great civility , declined the proposal . her sister was perhaps laid down upon the bed , or in her dressing gown , and therefore not able to come to them . “ oh , if that ’ s all , ” cried miss steele , “ we can just as well go and see _her_ . ”
austen	sense	elinor began to find this impertinence too much for her temper ; but she was saved the trouble of checking it , by lucy ’ s sharp reprimand , which now , as on many occasions , though it did not give much sweetness to the manners of one sister , was of advantage in governing those of the other .
austen	sense	chapter xxxiii . after some opposition , marianne yielded to her sister ’ s entreaties , and consented to go out with her and mrs. jennings one morning for half an hour . she expressly conditioned , however , for paying no visits , and would do no more than accompany them to gray ’ s in sackville street , where elinor was carrying on a negotiation for the exchange of a few old-fashioned jewels of her mother .
austen	sense	when they stopped at the door , mrs. jennings recollected that there was a lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call ; and as she had no business at gray ’ s , it was resolved , that while her young friends transacted their ’ s , she should pay her visit and return for them .
austen	sense	on ascending the stairs , the miss dashwoods found so many people before them in the room , that there was not a person at liberty to tend to their orders ; and they were obliged to wait . all that could be done was , to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the quickest succession ; one gentleman only was standing there , and it is probable that elinor was not without hope of exciting his politeness to a quicker despatch . but the correctness of his eye , and the delicacy of his taste , proved to be beyond his politeness . he was giving orders for a toothpick-case for himself , and till its size , shape , and ornaments were determined , all of which , after examining and debating for a quarter of an hour over every toothpick-case in the shop , were finally arranged by his own inventive fancy , he had no leisure to bestow any other attention on the two ladies , than what was comprised in three or four very broad stares ; a kind of notice which served to imprint on elinor the remembrance of a person and face , of strong , natural , sterling insignificance , though adorned in the first style of fashion .
austen	sense	marianne was spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt and resentment , on this impertinent examination of their features , and on the puppyism of his manner in deciding on all the different horrors of the different toothpick-cases presented to his inspection , by remaining unconscious of it all ; for she was as well able to collect her thoughts within herself , and be as ignorant of what was passing around her , in mr. gray ’ s shop , as in her own bedroom .
austen	sense	at last the affair was decided . the ivory , the gold , and the pearls , all received their appointment , and the gentleman having named the last day on which his existence could be continued without the possession of the toothpick-case , drew on his gloves with leisurely care , and bestowing another glance on the miss dashwoods , but such a one as seemed rather to demand than express admiration , walked off with a happy air of real conceit and affected indifference .
austen	sense	elinor lost no time in bringing her business forward , was on the point of concluding it , when another gentleman presented himself at her side . she turned her eyes towards his face , and found him with some surprise to be her brother .
austen	sense	their affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make a very creditable appearance in mr. gray ’ s shop . john dashwood was really far from being sorry to see his sisters again ; it rather gave them satisfaction ; and his inquiries after their mother were respectful and attentive .
austen	sense	elinor found that he and fanny had been in town two days . “ i wished very much to call upon you yesterday , ” said he , “ but it was impossible , for we were obliged to take harry to see the wild beasts at exeter exchange ; and we spent the rest of the day with mrs. ferrars . harry was vastly pleased . _this_ morning i had fully intended to call on you , if i could possibly find a spare half hour , but one has always so much to do on first coming to town . i am come here to bespeak fanny a seal . but tomorrow i think i shall certainly be able to call in berkeley street , and be introduced to your friend mrs. jennings . i understand she is a woman of very good fortune . and the middletons too , you must introduce me to _them_ . as my mother-in-law ’ s relations , i shall be happy to show them every respect . they are excellent neighbours to you in the country , i understand . ”
austen	sense	“ excellent indeed . their attention to our comfort , their friendliness in every particular , is more than i can express. ” “ i am extremely glad to hear it , upon my word ; extremely glad indeed . but so it ought to be ; they are people of large fortune , they are related to you , and every civility and accommodation that can serve to make your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected . and so you are most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for nothing ! edward brought us a most charming account of the place : the most complete thing of its kind , he said , that ever was , and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing . it was a great satisfaction to us to hear it , i assure you . ”
austen	sense	elinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother ; and was not sorry to be spared the necessity of answering him , by the arrival of mrs. jennings ’ s servant , who came to tell her that his mistress waited for them at the door .
austen	sense	mr. dashwood attended them down stairs , was introduced to mrs. jennings at the door of her carriage , and repeating his hope of being able to call on them the next day , took leave .
austen	sense	his visit was duly paid . he came with a pretence at an apology from their sister-in-law , for not coming too ; “ but she was so much engaged with her mother , that really she had no leisure for going any where. ” mrs. jennings , however , assured him directly , that she should not stand upon ceremony , for they were all cousins , or something like it , and she should certainly wait on mrs. john dashwood very soon , and bring her sisters to see her . his manners to _them_ , though calm , were perfectly kind ; to mrs. jennings , most attentively civil ; and on colonel brandon ’ s coming in soon after himself , he eyed him with a curiosity which seemed to say , that he only wanted to know him to be rich , to be equally civil to _him_ .
austen	sense	after staying with them half an hour , he asked elinor to walk with him to conduit street , and introduce him to sir john and lady middleton . the weather was remarkably fine , and she readily consented . as soon as they were out of the house , his enquiries began .
austen	sense	“ who is colonel brandon ? is he a man of fortune ? ” “ yes ; he has very good property in dorsetshire. ” “ i am glad of it . he seems a most gentlemanlike man ; and i think , elinor , i may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable establishment in life . ”
austen	sense	“ me , brother ! what do you mean ? ” “ he likes you . i observed him narrowly , and am convinced of it . what is the amount of his fortune ? ” “ i believe about two thousand a year . ”
austen	sense	“ two thousand a-year ; ” and then working himself up to a pitch of enthusiastic generosity , he added , “ elinor , i wish with all my heart it were _twice_ as much , for your sake . ”
austen	sense	“ indeed i believe you , ” replied elinor ; “ but i am very sure that colonel brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying _me_. ” “ you are mistaken , elinor ; you are very much mistaken . a very little trouble on your side secures him . perhaps just at present he may be undecided ; the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back ; his friends may all advise him against it . but some of those little attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix him , in spite of himself . and there can be no reason why you should not try for him . it is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on your side—in short , you know as to an attachment of that kind , it is quite out of the question , the objections are insurmountable—you have too much sense not to see all that . colonel brandon must be the man ; and no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with you and your family . it is a match that must give universal satisfaction . in short , it is a kind of thing that ” —lowering his voice to an important whisper— “ will be exceedingly welcome to _all parties_. ” recollecting himself , however , he added , “ that is , i mean to say—your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled ; fanny particularly , for she has your interest very much at heart , i assure you . and her mother too , mrs. ferrars , a very good-natured woman , i am sure it would give her great pleasure ; she said as much the other day . ”
austen	sense	elinor would not vouchsafe any answer . “ it would be something remarkable , now , ” he continued , “ something droll , if fanny should have a brother and i a sister settling at the same time . and yet it is not very unlikely . ”
austen	sense	“ is mr. edward ferrars , ” said elinor , with resolution , “ going to be married ? ” “ it is not actually settled , but there is such a thing in agitation . he has a most excellent mother . mrs. ferrars , with the utmost liberality , will come forward , and settle on him a thousand a year , if the match takes place . the lady is the hon . miss morton , only daughter of the late lord morton , with thirty thousand pounds . a very desirable connection on both sides , and i have not a doubt of its taking place in time . a thousand a-year is a great deal for a mother to give away , to make over for ever ; but mrs. ferrars has a noble spirit . to give you another instance of her liberality : —the other day , as soon as we came to town , aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now , she put bank-notes into fanny ’ s hands to the amount of two hundred pounds . and extremely acceptable it is , for we must live at a great expense while we are here . ”
austen	sense	he paused for her assent and compassion ; and she forced herself to say , “ your expenses both in town and country must certainly be considerable ; but your income is a large one . ”
austen	sense	“ not so large , i dare say , as many people suppose . i do not mean to complain , however ; it is undoubtedly a comfortable one , and i hope will in time be better . the enclosure of norland common , now carrying on , is a most serious drain . and then i have made a little purchase within this half year ; east kingham farm , you must remember the place , where old gibson used to live . the land was so very desirable for me in every respect , so immediately adjoining my own property , that i felt it my duty to buy it . i could not have answered it to my conscience to let it fall into any other hands . a man must pay for his convenience ; and it _has_ cost me a vast deal of money . ”
austen	sense	“ more than you think it really and intrinsically worth. ” “ why , i hope not that . i might have sold it again , the next day , for more than i gave : but , with regard to the purchase-money , i might have been very unfortunate indeed ; for the stocks were at that time so low , that if i had not happened to have the necessary sum in my banker ’ s hands , i must have sold out to very great loss . ”
austen	sense	elinor could only smile . “ other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming to norland . our respected father , as you well know , bequeathed all the stanhill effects that remained at norland ( and very valuable they were ) to your mother . far be it from me to repine at his doing so ; he had an undoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose , but , in consequence of it , we have been obliged to make large purchases of linen , china , & c. to supply the place of what was taken away . you may guess , after all these expenses , how very far we must be from being rich , and how acceptable mrs. ferrars ’ s kindness is . ”
austen	sense	“ certainly , ” said elinor ; “ and assisted by her liberality , i hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances. ” “ another year or two may do much towards it , ” he gravely replied ; “ but however there is still a great deal to be done . there is not a stone laid of fanny ’ s green-house , and nothing but the plan of the flower-garden marked out . ”
austen	sense	“ where is the green-house to be ? ” “ upon the knoll behind the house . the old walnut trees are all come down to make room for it . it will be a very fine object from many parts of the park , and the flower-garden will slope down just before it , and be exceedingly pretty . we have cleared away all the old thorns that grew in patches over the brow . ”
austen	sense	elinor kept her concern and her censure to herself ; and was very thankful that marianne was not present , to share the provocation . having now said enough to make his poverty clear , and to do away the necessity of buying a pair of ear-rings for each of his sisters , in his next visit at gray ’ s , his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn , and he began to congratulate elinor on having such a friend as mrs. jennings .
austen	sense	“ she seems a most valuable woman indeed . her house , her style of living , all bespeak an exceeding good income ; and it is an acquaintance that has not only been of great use to you hitherto , but in the end may prove materially advantageous . her inviting you to town is certainly a vast thing in your favour ; and indeed , it speaks altogether so great a regard for you , that in all probability when she dies you will not be forgotten . she must have a great deal to leave . ”
austen	sense	“ nothing at all , i should rather suppose ; for she has only her jointure , which will descend to her children. ” “ but it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income . few people of common prudence will do _that_ and whatever she saves , she will be able to dispose of . ”
austen	sense	“ and do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her daughters , than to us ? ” “ her daughters are both exceedingly well married , and therefore i can not perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther . whereas , in my opinion , by her taking so much notice of you , and treating you in this kind of way , she has given you a sort of claim on her future consideration , which a conscientious woman would not disregard . nothing can be kinder than her behaviour ; and she can hardly do all this , without being aware of the expectation it raises . ”
austen	sense	“ but she raises none in those most concerned . indeed , brother , your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far. ” “ why , to be sure , ” said he , seeming to recollect himself , “ people have little , have very little in their power . but , my dear elinor , what is the matter with marianne ? —she looks very unwell , has lost her colour , and is grown quite thin . is she ill ? ”
austen	sense	“ she is not well , she has had a nervous complaint on her for several weeks. ” “ i am sorry for that . at her time of life , any thing of an illness destroys the bloom for ever ! hers has been a very short one ! she was as handsome a girl last september , as i ever saw ; and as likely to attract the man . there was something in her style of beauty , to please them particularly . i remember fanny used to say that she would marry sooner and better than you did ; not but what she is exceedingly fond of _you_ , but so it happened to strike her . she will be mistaken , however . i question whether marianne _now_ , will marry a man worth more than five or six hundred a-year , at the utmost , and i am very much deceived if _you_ do not do better . dorsetshire ! i know very little of dorsetshire ; but , my dear elinor , i shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it ; and i think i can answer for your having fanny and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors . ”
austen	sense	elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was no likelihood of her marrying colonel brandon ; but it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished , and he was really resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman , and promoting the marriage by every possible attention . he had just compunction enough for having done nothing for his sisters himself , to be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should do a great deal ; and an offer from colonel brandon , or a legacy from mrs. jennings , was the easiest means of atoning for his own neglect .
austen	sense	they were lucky enough to find lady middleton at home , and sir john came in before their visit ended . abundance of civilities passed on all sides . sir john was ready to like anybody , and though mr. dashwood did not seem to know much about horses , he soon set him down as a very good-natured fellow : while lady middleton saw enough of fashion in his appearance to think his acquaintance worth having ; and mr. dashwood went away delighted with both .
austen	sense	“ i shall have a charming account to carry to fanny , ” said he , as he walked back with his sister . “ lady middleton is really a most elegant woman ! such a woman as i am sure fanny will be glad to know . and mrs. jennings too , an exceedingly well-behaved woman , though not so elegant as her daughter . your sister need not have any scruple even of visiting _her_ , which , to say the truth , has been a little the case , and very naturally ; for we only knew that mrs. jennings was the widow of a man who had got all his money in a low way ; and fanny and mrs. ferrars were both strongly prepossessed , that neither she nor her daughters were such kind of women as fanny would like to associate with . but now i can carry her a most satisfactory account of both . ”
austen	sense	chapter xxxiv . mrs. john dashwood had so much confidence in her husband ’ s judgment , that she waited the very next day both on mrs. jennings and her daughter ; and her confidence was rewarded by finding even the former , even the woman with whom her sisters were staying , by no means unworthy her notice ; and as for lady middleton , she found her one of the most charming women in the world !
austen	sense	lady middleton was equally pleased with mrs. dashwood . there was a kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides , which mutually attracted them ; and they sympathised with each other in an insipid propriety of demeanor , and a general want of understanding .
austen	sense	the same manners , however , which recommended mrs. john dashwood to the good opinion of lady middleton did not suit the fancy of mrs. jennings , and to _her_ she appeared nothing more than a little proud-looking woman of uncordial address , who met her husband ’ s sisters without any affection , and almost without having anything to say to them ; for of the quarter of an hour bestowed on berkeley street , she sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence .
austen	sense	elinor wanted very much to know , though she did not chuse to ask , whether edward was then in town ; but nothing would have induced fanny voluntarily to mention his name before her , till able to tell her that his marriage with miss morton was resolved on , or till her husband ’ s expectations on colonel brandon were answered ; because she believed them still so very much attached to each other , that they could not be too sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion . the intelligence however , which _she_ would not give , soon flowed from another quarter . lucy came very shortly to claim elinor ’ s compassion on being unable to see edward , though he had arrived in town with mr. and mrs. dashwood . he dared not come to bartlett ’ s buildings for fear of detection , and though their mutual impatience to meet , was not to be told , they could do nothing at present but write .
austen	sense	edward assured them himself of his being in town , within a very short time , by twice calling in berkeley street . twice was his card found on the table , when they returned from their morning ’ s engagements . elinor was pleased that he had called ; and still more pleased that she had missed him .
austen	sense	the dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted with the middletons , that , though not much in the habit of giving anything , they determined to give them—a dinner ; and soon after their acquaintance began , invited them to dine in harley street , where they had taken a very good house for three months . their sisters and mrs. jennings were invited likewise , and john dashwood was careful to secure colonel brandon , who , always glad to be where the miss dashwoods were , received his eager civilities with some surprise , but much more pleasure . they were to meet mrs. ferrars ; but elinor could not learn whether her sons were to be of the party . the expectation of seeing _her_ , however , was enough to make her interested in the engagement ; for though she could now meet edward ’ s mother without that strong anxiety which had once promised to attend such an introduction , though she could now see her with perfect indifference as to her opinion of herself , her desire of being in company with mrs. ferrars , her curiosity to know what she was like , was as lively as ever .
austen	sense	the interest with which she thus anticipated the party , was soon afterwards increased , more powerfully than pleasantly , by her hearing that the miss steeles were also to be at it .
austen	sense	so well had they recommended themselves to lady middleton , so agreeable had their assiduities made them to her , that though lucy was certainly not so elegant , and her sister not even genteel , she was as ready as sir john to ask them to spend a week or two in conduit street ; and it happened to be particularly convenient to the miss steeles , as soon as the dashwoods ’ invitation was known , that their visit should begin a few days before the party took place .
austen	sense	their claims to the notice of mrs. john dashwood , as the nieces of the gentleman who for many years had had the care of her brother , might not have done much , however , towards procuring them seats at her table ; but as lady middleton ’ s guests they must be welcome ; and lucy , who had long wanted to be personally known to the family , to have a nearer view of their characters and her own difficulties , and to have an opportunity of endeavouring to please them , had seldom been happier in her life , than she was on receiving mrs. john dashwood ’ s card .
austen	sense	on elinor its effect was very different . she began immediately to determine , that edward who lived with his mother , must be asked as his mother was , to a party given by his sister ; and to see him for the first time , after all that passed , in the company of lucy ! —she hardly knew how she could bear it !
austen	sense	these apprehensions , perhaps , were not founded entirely on reason , and certainly not at all on truth . they were relieved however , not by her own recollection , but by the good will of lucy , who believed herself to be inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her that edward certainly would not be in harley street on tuesday , and even hoped to be carrying the pain still farther by persuading her that he was kept away by the extreme affection for herself , which he could not conceal when they were together .
austen	sense	the important tuesday came that was to introduce the two young ladies to this formidable mother-in-law . “ pity me , dear miss dashwood ! ” said lucy , as they walked up the stairs together—for the middletons arrived so directly after mrs. jennings , that they all followed the servant at the same time : — “ there is nobody here but you , that can feel for me . i declare i can hardly stand . good gracious ! in a moment i shall see the person that all my happiness depends on—that is to be my mother ! ”
austen	sense	elinor could have given her immediate relief by suggesting the possibility of its being miss morton ’ s mother , rather than her own , whom they were about to behold ; but instead of doing that , she assured her , and with great sincerity , that she did pity her—to the utter amazement of lucy , who , though really uncomfortable herself , hoped at least to be an object of irrepressible envy to elinor .
austen	sense	mrs. ferrars was a little , thin woman , upright , even to formality , in her figure , and serious , even to sourness , in her aspect . her complexion was sallow ; and her features small , without beauty , and naturally without expression ; but a lucky contraction of the brow had rescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity , by giving it the strong characters of pride and ill nature . she was not a woman of many words ; for , unlike people in general , she proportioned them to the number of her ideas ; and of the few syllables that did escape her , not one fell to the share of miss dashwood , whom she eyed with the spirited determination of disliking her at all events .
austen	sense	elinor could not _now_ be made unhappy by this behaviour . a few months ago it would have hurt her exceedingly ; but it was not in mrs. ferrars ’ power to distress her by it now ; and the difference of her manners to the miss steeles , a difference which seemed purposely made to humble her more , only amused her . she could not but smile to see the graciousness of both mother and daughter towards the very person—for lucy was particularly distinguished—whom of all others , had they known as much as she did , they would have been most anxious to mortify ; while she herself , who had comparatively no power to wound them , sat pointedly slighted by both . but while she smiled at a graciousness so misapplied , she could not reflect on the mean-spirited folly from which it sprung , nor observe the studied attentions with which the miss steeles courted its continuance , without thoroughly despising them all four .
austen	sense	lucy was all exultation on being so honorably distinguished ; and miss steele wanted only to be teazed about dr. davies to be perfectly happy . the dinner was a grand one , the servants were numerous , and every thing bespoke the mistress ’ s inclination for show , and the master ’ s ability to support it . in spite of the improvements and additions which were making to the norland estate , and in spite of its owner having once been within some thousand pounds of being obliged to sell out at a loss , nothing gave any symptom of that indigence which he had tried to infer from it ; —no poverty of any kind , except of conversation , appeared—but there , the deficiency was considerable . john dashwood had not much to say for himself that was worth hearing , and his wife had still less . but there was no peculiar disgrace in this ; for it was very much the case with the chief of their visitors , who almost all laboured under one or other of these disqualifications for being agreeable—want of sense , either natural or improved—want of elegance—want of spirits—or want of temper .
austen	sense	when the ladies withdrew to the drawing-room after dinner , this poverty was particularly evident , for the gentlemen _had_ supplied the discourse with some variety—the variety of politics , inclosing land , and breaking horses—but then it was all over ; and one subject only engaged the ladies till coffee came in , which was the comparative heights of harry dashwood , and lady middleton ’ s second son william , who were nearly of the same age .
austen	sense	had both the children been there , the affair might have been determined too easily by measuring them at once ; but as harry only was present , it was all conjectural assertion on both sides ; and every body had a right to be equally positive in their opinion , and to repeat it over and over again as often as they liked .
austen	sense	the parties stood thus : the two mothers , though each really convinced that her own son was the tallest , politely decided in favour of the other . the two grandmothers , with not less partiality , but more sincerity , were equally earnest in support of their own descendant .
austen	sense	lucy , who was hardly less anxious to please one parent than the other , thought the boys were both remarkably tall for their age , and could not conceive that there could be the smallest difference in the world between them ; and miss steele , with yet greater address gave it , as fast as she could , in favour of each .
austen	sense	elinor , having once delivered her opinion on william ’ s side , by which she offended mrs. ferrars and fanny still more , did not see the necessity of enforcing it by any farther assertion ; and marianne , when called on for hers , offended them all , by declaring that she had no opinion to give , as she had never thought about it .
austen	sense	before her removing from norland , elinor had painted a very pretty pair of screens for her sister-in-law , which being now just mounted and brought home , ornamented her present drawing room ; and these screens , catching the eye of john dashwood on his following the other gentlemen into the room , were officiously handed by him to colonel brandon for his admiration .
austen	sense	“ these are done by my eldest sister , ” said he ; “ and you , as a man of taste , will , i dare say , be pleased with them . i do not know whether you have ever happened to see any of her performances before , but she is in general reckoned to draw extremely well . ”
austen	sense	the colonel , though disclaiming all pretensions to connoisseurship , warmly admired the screens , as he would have done any thing painted by miss dashwood ; and on the curiosity of the others being of course excited , they were handed round for general inspection . mrs. ferrars , not aware of their being elinor ’ s work , particularly requested to look at them ; and after they had received gratifying testimony of lady middletons ’ s approbation , fanny presented them to her mother , considerately informing her , at the same time , that they were done by miss dashwood .
austen	sense	“ hum ” —said mrs. ferrars— “ very pretty , ” —and without regarding them at all , returned them to her daughter . perhaps fanny thought for a moment that her mother had been quite rude enough , —for , colouring a little , she immediately said ,
austen	sense	“ they are very pretty , ma ’ am—an ’ t they ? ” but then again , the dread of having been too civil , too encouraging herself , probably came over her , for she presently added , “ do you not think they are something in miss morton ’ s style of painting , ma ’ am ? —_she does_ paint most delightfully ! —how beautifully her last landscape is done ! ”
austen	sense	“ beautifully indeed ! but _she_ does every thing well. ” marianne could not bear this.—she was already greatly displeased with mrs. ferrars ; and such ill-timed praise of another , at elinor ’ s expense , though she had not any notion of what was principally meant by it , provoked her immediately to say with warmth ,
austen	sense	“ this is admiration of a very particular kind ! —what is miss morton to us ? —who knows , or who cares , for her ? —it is elinor of whom _we_ think and speak. ” and so saying , she took the screens out of her sister-in-law ’ s hands , to admire them herself as they ought to be admired .
austen	sense	mrs. ferrars looked exceedingly angry , and drawing herself up more stiffly than ever , pronounced in retort this bitter philippic , “ miss morton is lord morton ’ s daughter. ” fanny looked very angry too , and her husband was all in a fright at his sister ’ s audacity . elinor was much more hurt by marianne ’ s warmth than she had been by what produced it ; but colonel brandon ’ s eyes , as they were fixed on marianne , declared that he noticed only what was amiable in it , the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a sister slighted in the smallest point .
austen	sense	marianne ’ s feelings did not stop here . the cold insolence of mrs. ferrars ’ s general behaviour to her sister , seemed , to her , to foretell such difficulties and distresses to elinor , as her own wounded heart taught her to think of with horror ; and urged by a strong impulse of affectionate sensibility , she moved after a moment , to her sister ’ s chair , and putting one arm round her neck , and one cheek close to hers , said in a low , but eager , voice ,
austen	sense	“ dear , dear elinor , don ’ t mind them . don ’ t let them make _you_ unhappy. ” she could say no more ; her spirits were quite overcome , and hiding her face on elinor ’ s shoulder , she burst into tears . every body ’ s attention was called , and almost every body was concerned.—colonel brandon rose up and went to them without knowing what he did.—mrs . jennings , with a very intelligent “ ah ! poor dear , ” immediately gave her her salts ; and sir john felt so desperately enraged against the author of this nervous distress , that he instantly changed his seat to one close by lucy steele , and gave her , in a whisper , a brief account of the whole shocking affair .
austen	sense	in a few minutes , however , marianne was recovered enough to put an end to the bustle , and sit down among the rest ; though her spirits retained the impression of what had passed , the whole evening .
austen	sense	“ poor marianne ! ” said her brother to colonel brandon , in a low voice , as soon as he could secure his attention : “ she has not such good health as her sister , —she is very nervous , —she has not elinor ’ s constitution ; —and one must allow that there is something very trying to a young woman who _has been_ a beauty in the loss of her personal attractions . you would not think it perhaps , but marianne _was_ remarkably handsome a few months ago ; quite as handsome as elinor . now you see it is all gone . ”
austen	sense	chapter xxxv . elinor ’ s curiosity to see mrs. ferrars was satisfied . she had found in her every thing that could tend to make a farther connection between the families undesirable . she had seen enough of her pride , her meanness , and her determined prejudice against herself , to comprehend all the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement , and retarded the marriage , of edward and herself , had he been otherwise free ; and she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her _own_ sake , that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any other of mrs. ferrars ’ s creation , preserved her from all dependence upon her caprice , or any solicitude for her good opinion . or at least , if she did not bring herself quite to rejoice in edward ’ s being fettered to lucy , she determined , that had lucy been more amiable , she _ought_ to have rejoiced .
austen	sense	she wondered that lucy ’ s spirits could be so very much elevated by the civility of mrs. ferrars ; —that her interest and her vanity should so very much blind her as to make the attention which seemed only paid her because she was _not elinor_ , appear a compliment to herself—or to allow her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her , because her real situation was unknown . but that it was so , had not only been declared by lucy ’ s eyes at the time , but was declared over again the next morning more openly , for at her particular desire , lady middleton set her down in berkeley street on the chance of seeing elinor alone , to tell her how happy she was .
austen	sense	the chance proved a lucky one , for a message from mrs. palmer soon after she arrived , carried mrs. jennings away . “ my dear friend , ” cried lucy , as soon as they were by themselves , “ i come to talk to you of my happiness . could anything be so flattering as mrs. ferrars ’ s way of treating me yesterday ? so exceeding affable as she was ! you know how i dreaded the thoughts of seeing her ; but the very moment i was introduced , there was such an affability in her behaviour as really should seem to say , she had quite took a fancy to me . now was not it so ? you saw it all ; and was not you quite struck with it ? ”
austen	sense	“ she was certainly very civil to you. ” “ civil ! —did you see nothing but only civility ? —i saw a vast deal more . such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me ! —no pride , no hauteur , and your sister just the same—all sweetness and affability ! ”
austen	sense	elinor wished to talk of something else , but lucy still pressed her to own that she had reason for her happiness ; and elinor was obliged to go on . “ undoubtedly , if they had known your engagement , ” said she , “ nothing could be more flattering than their treatment of you ; —but as that was not the case— ”
austen	sense	“ i guessed you would say so , ” —replied lucy quickly— “ but there was no reason in the world why mrs. ferrars should seem to like me , if she did not , and her liking me is every thing . you shan ’ t talk me out of my satisfaction . i am sure it will all end well , and there will be no difficulties at all , to what i used to think . mrs. ferrars is a charming woman , and so is your sister . they are both delightful women , indeed ! —i wonder i should never hear you say how agreeable mrs. dashwood was ! ”
austen	sense	to this elinor had no answer to make , and did not attempt any . “ are you ill , miss dashwood ? —you seem low—you don ’ t speak ; —sure you an ’ t well. ” “ i never was in better health . ”
austen	sense	“ i am glad of it with all my heart ; but really you did not look it . i should be sorry to have _you_ ill ; you , that have been the greatest comfort to me in the world ! —heaven knows what i should have done without your friendship . ”
austen	sense	elinor tried to make a civil answer , though doubting her own success . but it seemed to satisfy lucy , for she directly replied , “ indeed i am perfectly convinced of your regard for me , and next to edward ’ s love , it is the greatest comfort i have . poor edward ! but now there is one good thing , we shall be able to meet , and meet pretty often , for lady middleton ’ s delighted with mrs. dashwood , so we shall be a good deal in harley street , i dare say , and edward spends half his time with his sister—besides , lady middleton and mrs. ferrars will visit now ; —and mrs. ferrars and your sister were both so good to say more than once , they should always be glad to see me . they are such charming women ! —i am sure if ever you tell your sister what i think of her , you can not speak too high . ”
austen	sense	but elinor would not give her any encouragement to hope that she _should_ tell her sister . lucy continued . “ i am sure i should have seen it in a moment , if mrs. ferrars had took a dislike to me . if she had only made me a formal courtesy , for instance , without saying a word , and never after had took any notice of me , and never looked at me in a pleasant way—you know what i mean—if i had been treated in that forbidding sort of way , i should have gave it all up in despair . i could not have stood it . for where she _does_ dislike , i know it is most violent . ”
austen	sense	elinor was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph , by the door ’ s being thrown open , the servant ’ s announcing mr. ferrars , and edward ’ s immediately walking in . it was a very awkward moment ; and the countenance of each showed that it was so . they all looked exceedingly foolish ; and edward seemed to have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again , as to advance farther into it . the very circumstance , in its unpleasantest form , which they would each have been most anxious to avoid , had fallen on them.—they were not only all three together , but were together without the relief of any other person . the ladies recovered themselves first . it was not lucy ’ s business to put herself forward , and the appearance of secrecy must still be kept up . she could therefore only _look_ her tenderness , and after slightly addressing him , said no more .
austen	sense	but elinor had more to do ; and so anxious was she , for his sake and her own , to do it well , that she forced herself , after a moment ’ s recollection , to welcome him , with a look and manner that were almost easy , and almost open ; and another struggle , another effort still improved them . she would not allow the presence of lucy , nor the consciousness of some injustice towards herself , to deter her from saying that she was happy to see him , and that she had very much regretted being from home , when he called before in berkeley street . she would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which , as a friend and almost a relation , were his due , by the observant eyes of lucy , though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her .
austen	sense	her manners gave some re-assurance to edward , and he had courage enough to sit down ; but his embarrassment still exceeded that of the ladies in a proportion , which the case rendered reasonable , though his sex might make it rare ; for his heart had not the indifference of lucy ’ s , nor could his conscience have quite the ease of elinor ’ s .
austen	sense	lucy , with a demure and settled air , seemed determined to make no contribution to the comfort of the others , and would not say a word ; and almost every thing that _was_ said , proceeded from elinor , who was obliged to volunteer all the information about her mother ’ s health , their coming to town , & c. which edward ought to have inquired about , but never did .
austen	sense	her exertions did not stop here ; for she soon afterwards felt herself so heroically disposed as to determine , under pretence of fetching marianne , to leave the others by themselves ; and she really did it , and _that_ in the handsomest manner , for she loitered away several minutes on the landing-place , with the most high-minded fortitude , before she went to her sister . when that was once done , however , it was time for the raptures of edward to cease ; for marianne ’ s joy hurried her into the drawing-room immediately . her pleasure in seeing him was like every other of her feelings , strong in itself , and strongly spoken . she met him with a hand that would be taken , and a voice that expressed the affection of a sister .
austen	sense	“ dear edward ! ” she cried , “ this is a moment of great happiness ! —this would almost make amends for every thing ! ” edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved , but before such witnesses he dared not say half what he really felt . again they all sat down , and for a moment or two all were silent ; while marianne was looking with the most speaking tenderness , sometimes at edward and sometimes at elinor , regretting only that their delight in each other should be checked by lucy ’ s unwelcome presence . edward was the first to speak , and it was to notice marianne ’ s altered looks , and express his fear of her not finding london agree with her .
austen	sense	“ oh , don ’ t think of me ! ” she replied with spirited earnestness , though her eyes were filled with tears as she spoke , “ don ’ t think of _my_ health . elinor is well , you see . that must be enough for us both . ”
austen	sense	this remark was not calculated to make edward or elinor more easy , nor to conciliate the good will of lucy , who looked up at marianne with no very benignant expression .
austen	sense	“ do you like london ? ” said edward , willing to say any thing that might introduce another subject . “ not at all . i expected much pleasure in it , but i have found none . the sight of you , edward , is the only comfort it has afforded ; and thank heaven ! you are what you always were ! ”
austen	sense	she paused—no one spoke . “ i think , elinor , ” she presently added , “ we must employ edward to take care of us in our return to barton . in a week or two , i suppose , we shall be going ; and , i trust , edward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge . ”
austen	sense	poor edward muttered something , but what it was , nobody knew , not even himself . but marianne , who saw his agitation , and could easily trace it to whatever cause best pleased herself , was perfectly satisfied , and soon talked of something else .
austen	sense	“ we spent such a day , edward , in harley street yesterday ! so dull , so wretchedly dull ! —but i have much to say to you on that head , which can not be said now . ”
austen	sense	and with this admirable discretion did she defer the assurance of her finding their mutual relatives more disagreeable than ever , and of her being particularly disgusted with his mother , till they were more in private .
austen	sense	“ but why were you not there , edward ? —why did you not come ? ” “ i was engaged elsewhere. ” “ engaged ! but what was that , when such friends were to be met ? ” “ perhaps , miss marianne , ” cried lucy , eager to take some revenge on her , “ you think young men never stand upon engagements , if they have no mind to keep them , little as well as great . ”
austen	sense	elinor was very angry , but marianne seemed entirely insensible of the sting ; for she calmly replied , “ not so , indeed ; for , seriously speaking , i am very sure that conscience only kept edward from harley street . and i really believe he _has_ the most delicate conscience in the world ; the most scrupulous in performing every engagement , however minute , and however it may make against his interest or pleasure . he is the most fearful of giving pain , of wounding expectation , and the most incapable of being selfish , of any body i ever saw . edward , it is so , and i will say it . what ! are you never to hear yourself praised ! —then you must be no friend of mine ; for those who will accept of my love and esteem , must submit to my open commendation . ”
austen	sense	the nature of her commendation , in the present case , however , happened to be particularly ill-suited to the feelings of two thirds of her auditors , and was so very unexhilarating to edward , that he very soon got up to go away .
austen	sense	“ going so soon ! ” said marianne ; “ my dear edward , this must not be. ” and drawing him a little aside , she whispered her persuasion that lucy could not stay much longer . but even this encouragement failed , for he would go ; and lucy , who would have outstaid him , had his visit lasted two hours , soon afterwards went away .
austen	sense	“ what can bring her here so often ? ” said marianne , on her leaving them . “ could not she see that we wanted her gone ! —how teazing to edward ! ” “ why so ? —we were all his friends , and lucy has been the longest known to him of any . it is but natural that he should like to see her as well as ourselves . ”
austen	sense	marianne looked at her steadily , and said , “ you know , elinor , that this is a kind of talking which i can not bear . if you only hope to have your assertion contradicted , as i must suppose to be the case , you ought to recollect that i am the last person in the world to do it . i can not descend to be tricked out of assurances , that are not really wanted . ”
austen	sense	she then left the room ; and elinor dared not follow her to say more , for bound as she was by her promise of secrecy to lucy , she could give no information that would convince marianne ; and painful as the consequences of her still continuing in an error might be , she was obliged to submit to it . all that she could hope , was that edward would not often expose her or himself to the distress of hearing marianne ’ s mistaken warmth , nor to the repetition of any other part of the pain that had attended their recent meeting—and this she had every reason to expect .
austen	sense	chapter xxxvi . within a few days after this meeting , the newspapers announced to the world , that the lady of thomas palmer , esq . was safely delivered of a son and heir ; a very interesting and satisfactory paragraph , at least to all those intimate connections who knew it before .
austen	sense	this event , highly important to mrs. jennings ’ s happiness , produced a temporary alteration in the disposal of her time , and influenced , in a like degree , the engagements of her young friends ; for as she wished to be as much as possible with charlotte , she went thither every morning as soon as she was dressed , and did not return till late in the evening ; and the miss dashwoods , at the particular request of the middletons , spent the whole of every day in conduit street . for their own comfort they would much rather have remained , at least all the morning , in mrs. jennings ’ s house ; but it was not a thing to be urged against the wishes of everybody . their hours were therefore made over to lady middleton and the two miss steeles , by whom their company , in fact was as little valued , as it was professedly sought .
austen	sense	they had too much sense to be desirable companions to the former ; and by the latter they were considered with a jealous eye , as intruding on _their_ ground , and sharing the kindness which they wanted to monopolize . though nothing could be more polite than lady middleton ’ s behaviour to elinor and marianne , she did not really like them at all . because they neither flattered herself nor her children , she could not believe them good-natured ; and because they were fond of reading , she fancied them satirical : perhaps without exactly knowing what it was to be satirical ; but _that_ did not signify . it was censure in common use , and easily given .
austen	sense	their presence was a restraint both on her and on lucy . it checked the idleness of one , and the business of the other . lady middleton was ashamed of doing nothing before them , and the flattery which lucy was proud to think of and administer at other times , she feared they would despise her for offering . miss steele was the least discomposed of the three , by their presence ; and it was in their power to reconcile her to it entirely . would either of them only have given her a full and minute account of the whole affair between marianne and mr. willoughby , she would have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice of the best place by the fire after dinner , which their arrival occasioned . but this conciliation was not granted ; for though she often threw out expressions of pity for her sister to elinor , and more than once dropt a reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before marianne , no effect was produced , but a look of indifference from the former , or of disgust in the latter . an effort even yet lighter might have made her their friend . would they only have laughed at her about the doctor ! but so little were they , any more than the others , inclined to oblige her , that if sir john dined from home , she might spend a whole day without hearing any other raillery on the subject , than what she was kind enough to bestow on herself .
austen	sense	all these jealousies and discontents , however , were so totally unsuspected by mrs. jennings , that she thought it a delightful thing for the girls to be together ; and generally congratulated her young friends every night , on having escaped the company of a stupid old woman so long . she joined them sometimes at sir john ’ s , sometimes at her own house ; but wherever it was , she always came in excellent spirits , full of delight and importance , attributing charlotte ’ s well doing to her own care , and ready to give so exact , so minute a detail of her situation , as only miss steele had curiosity enough to desire . one thing _did_ disturb her ; and of that she made her daily complaint . mr. palmer maintained the common , but unfatherly opinion among his sex , of all infants being alike ; and though she could plainly perceive , at different times , the most striking resemblance between this baby and every one of his relations on both sides , there was no convincing his father of it ; no persuading him to believe that it was not exactly like every other baby of the same age ; nor could he even be brought to acknowledge the simple proposition of its being the finest child in the world .
austen	sense	i come now to the relation of a misfortune , which about this time befell mrs. john dashwood . it so happened that while her two sisters with mrs. jennings were first calling on her in harley street , another of her acquaintance had dropt in—a circumstance in itself not apparently likely to produce evil to her . but while the imaginations of other people will carry them away to form wrong judgments of our conduct , and to decide on it by slight appearances , one ’ s happiness must in some measure be always at the mercy of chance . in the present instance , this last-arrived lady allowed her fancy to so far outrun truth and probability , that on merely hearing the name of the miss dashwoods , and understanding them to be mr. dashwood ’ s sisters , she immediately concluded them to be staying in harley street ; and this misconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards , cards of invitation for them as well as for their brother and sister , to a small musical party at her house . the consequence of which was , that mrs. john dashwood was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly great inconvenience of sending her carriage for the miss dashwoods , but , what was still worse , must be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearing to treat them with attention : and who could tell that they might not expect to go out with her a second time ? the power of disappointing them , it was true , must always be hers . but that was not enough ; for when people are determined on a mode of conduct which they know to be wrong , they feel injured by the expectation of any thing better from them .
austen	sense	marianne had now been brought by degrees , so much into the habit of going out every day , that it was become a matter of indifference to her , whether she went or not : and she prepared quietly and mechanically for every evening ’ s engagement , though without expecting the smallest amusement from any , and very often without knowing , till the last moment , where it was to take her .
austen	sense	to her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly indifferent , as not to bestow half the consideration on it , during the whole of her toilet , which it received from miss steele in the first five minutes of their being together , when it was finished . nothing escaped _her_ minute observation and general curiosity ; she saw every thing , and asked every thing ; was never easy till she knew the price of every part of marianne ’ s dress ; could have guessed the number of her gowns altogether with better judgment than marianne herself , and was not without hopes of finding out before they parted , how much her washing cost per week , and how much she had every year to spend upon herself . the impertinence of these kind of scrutinies , moreover , was generally concluded with a compliment , which though meant as its douceur , was considered by marianne as the greatest impertinence of all ; for after undergoing an examination into the value and make of her gown , the colour of her shoes , and the arrangement of her hair , she was almost sure of being told that upon “ her word she looked vastly smart , and she dared to say she would make a great many conquests . ”
austen	sense	with such encouragement as this , was she dismissed on the present occasion , to her brother ’ s carriage ; which they were ready to enter five minutes after it stopped at the door , a punctuality not very agreeable to their sister-in-law , who had preceded them to the house of her acquaintance , and was there hoping for some delay on their part that might inconvenience either herself or her coachman .
austen	sense	the events of this evening were not very remarkable . the party , like other musical parties , comprehended a great many people who had real taste for the performance , and a great many more who had none at all ; and the performers themselves were , as usual , in their own estimation , and that of their immediate friends , the first private performers in england .
austen	sense	as elinor was neither musical , nor affecting to be so , she made no scruple of turning her eyes from the grand pianoforte , whenever it suited her , and unrestrained even by the presence of a harp , and violoncello , would fix them at pleasure on any other object in the room . in one of these excursive glances she perceived among a group of young men , the very he , who had given them a lecture on toothpick-cases at gray ’ s . she perceived him soon afterwards looking at herself , and speaking familiarly to her brother ; and had just determined to find out his name from the latter , when they both came towards her , and mr. dashwood introduced him to her as mr. robert ferrars .
austen	sense	he addressed her with easy civility , and twisted his head into a bow which assured her as plainly as words could have done , that he was exactly the coxcomb she had heard him described to be by lucy . happy had it been for her , if her regard for edward had depended less on his own merit , than on the merit of his nearest relations ! for then his brother ’ s bow must have given the finishing stroke to what the ill-humour of his mother and sister would have begun . but while she wondered at the difference of the two young men , she did not find that the emptiness and conceit of the one , put her out of all charity with the modesty and worth of the other . why they _were_ different , robert explained to her himself in the course of a quarter of an hour ’ s conversation ; for , talking of his brother , and lamenting the extreme _gaucherie_ which he really believed kept him from mixing in proper society , he candidly and generously attributed it much less to any natural deficiency , than to the misfortune of a private education ; while he himself , though probably without any particular , any material superiority by nature , merely from the advantage of a public school , was as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man .
austen	sense	“ upon my soul , ” he added , “ i believe it is nothing more ; and so i often tell my mother , when she is grieving about it . ‘ my dear madam , ’ i always say to her , ‘ you must make yourself easy . the evil is now irremediable , and it has been entirely your own doing . why would you be persuaded by my uncle , sir robert , against your own judgment , to place edward under private tuition , at the most critical time of his life ? if you had only sent him to westminster as well as myself , instead of sending him to mr. pratt ’ s , all this would have been prevented. ’ this is the way in which i always consider the matter , and my mother is perfectly convinced of her error . ”
austen	sense	elinor would not oppose his opinion , because , whatever might be her general estimation of the advantage of a public school , she could not think of edward ’ s abode in mr. pratt ’ s family , with any satisfaction .
austen	sense	“ you reside in devonshire , i think , ” —was his next observation , “ in a cottage near dawlish. ” elinor set him right as to its situation ; and it seemed rather surprising to him that anybody could live in devonshire , without living near dawlish . he bestowed his hearty approbation however on their species of house .
austen	sense	“ for my own part , ” said he , “ i am excessively fond of a cottage ; there is always so much comfort , so much elegance about them . and i protest , if i had any money to spare , i should buy a little land and build one myself , within a short distance of london , where i might drive myself down at any time , and collect a few friends about me , and be happy . i advise every body who is going to build , to build a cottage . my friend lord courtland came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice , and laid before me three different plans of bonomi ’ s . i was to decide on the best of them . ‘ my dear courtland , ’ said i , immediately throwing them all into the fire , ‘ do not adopt either of them , but by all means build a cottage. ’ and that i fancy , will be the end of it .
austen	sense	“ some people imagine that there can be no accommodations , no space in a cottage ; but this is all a mistake . i was last month at my friend elliott ’ s , near dartford . lady elliott wished to give a dance . ‘ but how can it be done ? ’ said she ; ‘ my dear ferrars , do tell me how it is to be managed . there is not a room in this cottage that will hold ten couple , and where can the supper be ? ’ _i_ immediately saw that there could be no difficulty in it , so i said , ‘ my dear lady elliott , do not be uneasy . the dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease ; card-tables may be placed in the drawing-room ; the library may be open for tea and other refreshments ; and let the supper be set out in the saloon. ’ lady elliott was delighted with the thought . we measured the dining-room , and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple , and the affair was arranged precisely after my plan . so that , in fact , you see , if people do but know how to set about it , every comfort may be as well enjoyed in a cottage as in the most spacious dwelling . ”
austen	sense	elinor agreed to it all , for she did not think he deserved the compliment of rational opposition . as john dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his eldest sister , his mind was equally at liberty to fix on any thing else ; and a thought struck him during the evening , which he communicated to his wife , for her approbation , when they got home . the consideration of mrs. dennison ’ s mistake , in supposing his sisters their guests , had suggested the propriety of their being really invited to become such , while mrs. jennings ’ s engagements kept her from home . the expense would be nothing , the inconvenience not more ; and it was altogether an attention which the delicacy of his conscience pointed out to be requisite to its complete enfranchisement from his promise to his father . fanny was startled at the proposal .
austen	sense	“ i do not see how it can be done , ” said she , “ without affronting lady middleton , for they spend every day with her ; otherwise i should be exceedingly glad to do it . you know i am always ready to pay them any attention in my power , as my taking them out this evening shows . but they are lady middleton ’ s visitors . how can i ask them away from her ? ”
austen	sense	her husband , but with great humility , did not see the force of her objection . “ they had already spent a week in this manner in conduit street , and lady middleton could not be displeased at their giving the same number of days to such near relations . ”
austen	sense	fanny paused a moment , and then , with fresh vigor , said , “ my love , i would ask them with all my heart , if it was in my power . but i had just settled within myself to ask the miss steeles to spend a few days with us . they are very well behaved , good kind of girls ; and i think the attention is due to them , as their uncle did so very well by edward . we can ask your sisters some other year , you know ; but the miss steeles may not be in town any more . i am sure you will like them ; indeed , you _do_ like them , you know , very much already , and so does my mother ; and they are such favourites with harry ! ”
austen	sense	mr. dashwood was convinced . he saw the necessity of inviting the miss steeles immediately , and his conscience was pacified by the resolution of inviting his sisters another year ; at the same time , however , slyly suspecting that another year would make the invitation needless , by bringing elinor to town as colonel brandon ’ s wife , and marianne as _their_ visitor .
austen	sense	fanny , rejoicing in her escape , and proud of the ready wit that had procured it , wrote the next morning to lucy , to request her company and her sister ’ s , for some days , in harley street , as soon as lady middleton could spare them . this was enough to make lucy really and reasonably happy . mrs. dashwood seemed actually working for her , herself ; cherishing all her hopes , and promoting all her views ! such an opportunity of being with edward and his family was , above all things , the most material to her interest , and such an invitation the most gratifying to her feelings ! it was an advantage that could not be too gratefully acknowledged , nor too speedily made use of ; and the visit to lady middleton , which had not before had any precise limits , was instantly discovered to have been always meant to end in two days ’ time .
austen	sense	when the note was shown to elinor , as it was within ten minutes after its arrival , it gave her , for the first time , some share in the expectations of lucy ; for such a mark of uncommon kindness , vouchsafed on so short an acquaintance , seemed to declare that the good-will towards her arose from something more than merely malice against herself ; and might be brought , by time and address , to do every thing that lucy wished . her flattery had already subdued the pride of lady middleton , and made an entry into the close heart of mrs. john dashwood ; and these were effects that laid open the probability of greater .
austen	sense	the miss steeles removed to harley street , and all that reached elinor of their influence there , strengthened her expectation of the event . sir john , who called on them more than once , brought home such accounts of the favour they were in , as must be universally striking . mrs. dashwood had never been so much pleased with any young women in her life , as she was with them ; had given each of them a needle book made by some emigrant ; called lucy by her christian name ; and did not know whether she should ever be able to part with them .
austen	sense	end of the second volume chapter xxxvii . mrs. palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight , that her mother felt it no longer necessary to give up the whole of her time to her ; and , contenting herself with visiting her once or twice a day , returned from that period to her own home , and her own habits , in which she found the miss dashwoods very ready to resume their former share .
austen	sense	about the third or fourth morning after their being thus resettled in berkeley street , mrs. jennings , on returning from her ordinary visit to mrs. palmer , entered the drawing-room , where elinor was sitting by herself , with an air of such hurrying importance as prepared her to hear something wonderful ; and giving her time only to form that idea , began directly to justify it , by saying ,
austen	sense	“ lord ! my dear miss dashwood ! have you heard the news ? ” “ no , ma ’ am . what is it ? ” “ something so strange ! but you shall hear it all . when i got to mr. palmer ’ s , i found charlotte quite in a fuss about the child . she was sure it was very ill—it cried , and fretted , and was all over pimples . so i looked at it directly , and , ‘ lord ! my dear , ’ says i , ‘ it is nothing in the world , but the red gum ; ’ and nurse said just the same . but charlotte , she would not be satisfied , so mr. donavan was sent for ; and luckily he happened to just come in from harley street , so he stepped over directly , and as soon as ever he saw the child , he said just as we did , that it was nothing in the world but the red gum , and then charlotte was easy . and so , just as he was going away again , it came into my head , i am sure i do not know how i happened to think of it , but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news . so upon that , he smirked , and simpered , and looked grave , and seemed to know something or other , and at last he said in a whisper , ‘ for fear any unpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as to their sister ’ s indisposition , i think it advisable to say , that i believe there is no great reason for alarm ; i hope mrs. dashwood will do very well . ’ ”
austen	sense	“ what ! is fanny ill ? ” “ that is exactly what i said , my dear . ‘ lord ! ’ says i , ‘ is mrs. dashwood ill ? ’ so then it all came out ; and the long and the short of the matter , by all i can learn , seems to be this . mr. edward ferrars , the very young man i used to joke with you about ( but however , as it turns out , i am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it ) , mr. edward ferrars , it seems , has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin lucy ! —there ’ s for you , my dear ! and not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter , except nancy ! could you have believed such a thing possible ? there is no great wonder in their liking one another ; but that matters should be brought so forward between them , and nobody suspect it ! _that_ is strange ! i never happened to see them together , or i am sure i should have found it out directly . well , and so this was kept a great secret , for fear of mrs. ferrars , and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter : till this very morning , poor nancy , who , you know , is a well-meaning creature , but no conjurer , popt it all out . ‘ lord ! ’ thinks she to herself , ‘ they are all so fond of lucy , to be sure they will make no difficulty about it ; ’ and so , away she went to your sister , who was sitting all alone at her carpet-work , little suspecting what was to come—for she had just been saying to your brother , only five minutes before , that she thought to make a match between edward and some lord ’ s daughter or other , i forget who . so you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride . she fell into violent hysterics immediately , with such screams as reached your brother ’ s ears , as he was sitting in his own dressing-room down stairs , thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country . so up he flew directly , and a terrible scene took place , for lucy was come to them by that time , little dreaming what was going on . poor soul ! i pity _her_ . and i must say , i think she was used very hardly ; for your sister scolded like any fury , and soon drove her into a fainting fit . nancy , she fell upon her knees , and cried bitterly ; and your brother , he walked about the room , and said he did not know what to do . mrs. dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house , and your brother was forced to go down upon _his_ knees too , to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes . _then_ she fell into hysterics again , and he was so frightened that he would send for mr. donavan , and mr. donavan found the house in all this uproar . the carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away , and they were just stepping in as he came off ; poor lucy in such a condition , he says , she could hardly walk ; and nancy , she was almost as bad . i declare , i have no patience with your sister ; and i hope , with all my heart , it will be a match in spite of her . lord ! what a taking poor mr. edward will be in when he hears of it ! to have his love used so scornfully ! for they say he is monstrous fond of her , as well he may . i should not wonder , if he was to be in the greatest passion ! —and mr. donavan thinks just the same . he and i had a great deal of talk about it ; and the best of all is , that he is gone back again to harley street , that he may be within call when mrs. ferrars is told of it , for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house , for your sister was sure _she_ would be in hysterics too ; and so she may , for what i care . i have no pity for either of them . i have no notion of people ’ s making such a to-do about money and greatness . there is no reason on earth why mr. edward and lucy should not marry ; for i am sure mrs. ferrars may afford to do very well by her son , and though lucy has next to nothing herself , she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing ; i dare say , if mrs. ferrars would only allow him five hundred a-year , she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight . lord ! how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours—or a little bigger—with two maids , and two men ; and i believe i could help them to a housemaid , for my betty has a sister out of place , that would fit them exactly . ”
austen	sense	here mrs. jennings ceased , and as elinor had had time enough to collect her thoughts , she was able to give such an answer , and make such observations , as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce . happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary interest in it ; that mrs. jennings ( as she had of late often hoped might be the case ) had ceased to imagine her at all attached to edward ; and happy above all the rest , in the absence of marianne , she felt very well able to speak of the affair without embarrassment , and to give her judgment , as she believed , with impartiality on the conduct of every one concerned in it .
austen	sense	she could hardly determine what her own expectation of its event really was ; though she earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its being possible to end otherwise at last , than in the marriage of edward and lucy . what mrs. ferrars would say and do , though there could not be a doubt of its nature , she was anxious to hear ; and still more anxious to know how edward would conduct himself . for _him_ she felt much compassion ; —for lucy very little—and it cost her some pains to procure that little ; —for the rest of the party none at all .
christie	ackroyd	“ i don ’ t know what you mean , ” i said , quite untruthfully . “ why shouldn ’ t miss russell consult me about her bad knee ? ” “ bad knee , ” said caroline . “ fiddlesticks ! no more bad knee than you and i . she was after something else . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ what ? ” i asked . caroline had to admit that she didn ’ t know . “ but depend upon it , that was what he was trying to get at , m. poirot , i mean . there ’ s something fishy about that woman , and he knows it . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ precisely the remark mrs. ackroyd made to me yesterday , ” i said . “ that there was something fishy about miss russell. ” “ ah ! ” said caroline darkly , “ mrs . ackroyd ! there ’ s another ! ” “ another what ? ” caroline refused to explain her remarks . she merely nodded her head several times , rolled up her knitting , and went upstairs to don the high mauve silk blouse and the gold locket which she calls dressing for dinner .
christie	ackroyd	i stayed there staring into the fire and thinking over caroline ’ s words . had poirot really come to gain information about miss russell , or was it only caroline ’ s tortuous mind that interpreted everything according to her own ideas ?
christie	ackroyd	there had certainly been nothing in miss russell ’ s manner that morning to arouse suspicion . at least—— i remembered her persistent conversation on the subject of drug-taking and from that she had led the conversation to poisons and poisoning . but there was nothing in that . ackroyd had not been poisoned . still , it was odd ....
christie	ackroyd	i heard caroline ’ s voice , rather acid in note , calling from the top of the stairs . “ james , you will be late for dinner. ” i put some coal on the fire and went upstairs obediently .
christie	ackroyd	it is well at any price to have peace in the home . chapter xii round the table a joint inquest was held on monday . i do not propose to give the proceedings in detail . to do so would only be to go over the same ground again and again . by arrangement with the police , very little was allowed to come out . i gave evidence as to the cause of ackroyd ’ s death and the probable time . the absence of ralph paton was commented on by the coroner , but not unduly stressed .
christie	ackroyd	afterwards , poirot and i had a few words with inspector raglan . the inspector was very grave . “ it looks bad , mr. poirot , ” he said . “ i ’ m trying to judge the thing fair and square . i ’ m a local man , and i ’ ve seen captain paton many times in cranchester . i ’ m not wanting him to be the guilty one—but it ’ s bad whichever way you look at it . if he ’ s innocent , why doesn ’ t he come forward ? we ’ ve got evidence against him , but it ’ s just possible that that evidence could be explained away . then why doesn ’ t he give an explanation ? ”
christie	ackroyd	a lot more lay behind the inspector ’ s words than i knew at the time . ralph ’ s description had been wired to every port and railway station in england . the police everywhere were on the alert . his rooms in town were watched , and any houses he had been known to be in the habit of frequenting . with such a _cordon_ it seemed impossible that ralph should be able to evade detection . he had no luggage , and , as far as any one knew , no money .
christie	ackroyd	“ i can ’ t find any one who saw him at the station that night , ” continued the inspector . “ and yet he ’ s well known down here , and you ’ d think somebody would have noticed him . there ’ s no news from liverpool either . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ you think he went to liverpool ? ” queried poirot . “ well , it ’ s on the cards . that telephone message from the station , just three minutes before the liverpool express left—there ought to be something in that . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ unless it was deliberately intended to throw you off the scent . that might just possibly be the point of the telephone message. ” “ that ’ s an idea , ” said the inspector eagerly . “ do you really think that ’ s the explanation of the telephone call ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ my friend , ” said poirot gravely , “ i do not know . but i will tell you this : i believe that when we find the explanation of that telephone call we shall find the explanation of the murder . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ you said something like that before , i remember , ” i observed , looking at him curiously . poirot nodded . “ i always come back to it , ” he said seriously . “ it seems to me utterly irrelevant , ” i declared .
christie	ackroyd	“ i wouldn ’ t say that , ” demurred the inspector . “ but i must confess i think mr. poirot here harps on it a little too much . we ’ ve better clews than that . the fingerprints on the dagger , for instance . ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot became suddenly very foreign in manner , as he often did when excited over anything . “ m . l ’ inspecteur , ” he said , “ beware of the blind—the blind—_comment dire ? _—the little street that has no end to it . ”
christie	ackroyd	inspector raglan stared , but i was quicker . “ you mean a blind alley ? ” i said . “ that is it—the blind street that leads nowhere . so it may be with those fingerprints—they may lead you nowhere . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i don ’ t see how that can well be , ” said the police officer . “ i suppose you ’ re hinting that they ’ re faked ? i ’ ve read of such things being done , though i can ’ t say i ’ ve ever come across it in my experience . but fake or true—they ’ re bound to lead _somewhere_ . ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot merely shrugged his shoulders , flinging out his arms wide . the inspector then showed us various enlarged photographs of the fingerprints , and proceeded to become technical on the subject of loops and whorls .
christie	ackroyd	“ come now , ” he said at last , annoyed by poirot ’ s detached manner , “ you ’ ve got to admit that those prints were made by some one who was in the house that night ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ _bien entendu_ , ” said poirot , nodding his head . “ well , i ’ ve taken the prints of every member of the household , every one , mind you , from the old lady down to the kitchenmaid . ”
christie	ackroyd	i don ’ t think mrs. ackroyd would enjoy being referred to as the old lady . she must spend a considerable amount on cosmetics . “ every one ’ s , ” repeated the inspector fussily . “ including mine , ” i said dryly .
christie	ackroyd	“ very well . none of them correspond . that leaves us two alternatives . ralph paton , or the mysterious stranger the doctor here tells us about . when we get hold of those two—— ”
christie	ackroyd	“ much valuable time may have been lost , ” broke in poirot . “ i don ’ t quite get you , mr. poirot ? ” “ you have taken the prints of every one in the house , you say , ” murmured poirot . “ is that the exact truth you are telling me there , m. l ’ inspecteur ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ certainly. ” “ without overlooking any one ? ” “ without overlooking any one. ” “ the quick or the dead ? ” for a moment the inspector looked bewildered at what he took to be a religious observation . then he reacted slowly .
christie	ackroyd	“ you mean—— ” “ the dead , m. l ’ inspecteur. ” the inspector still took a minute or two to understand . “ i am suggesting , ” said poirot placidly , “ that the fingerprints on the dagger handle are those of mr. ackroyd himself . it is an easy matter to verify . his body is still available . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ but why ? what would be the point of it ? you ’ re surely not suggesting suicide , mr. poirot ? ” “ ah ! no . my theory is that the murderer wore gloves or wrapped something round his hand . after the blow was struck , he picked up the victim ’ s hand and closed it round the dagger handle . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ but why ? ” poirot shrugged his shoulders again . “ to make a confusing case even more confusing. ” “ well , ” said the inspector , “ i ’ ll look into it . what gave you the idea in the first place ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ when you were so kind as to show me the dagger and draw attention to the fingerprints . i know very little of loops and whorls—see , i confess my ignorance frankly . but it did occur to me that the position of the prints was somewhat awkward . not so would i have held a dagger in order to strike . naturally , with the right hand brought up over the shoulder backwards , it would have been difficult to put it in exactly the right position . ”
christie	ackroyd	inspector raglan stared at the little man . poirot , with an air of great unconcern , flecked a speck of dust from his coat sleeve . “ well , ” said the inspector , “ it ’ s an idea . i ’ ll look into it all right , but don ’ t you be disappointed if nothing comes of it . ”
christie	ackroyd	he endeavored to make his tone kindly and patronizing . poirot watched him go off . then he turned to me with twinkling eyes . “ another time , ” he observed , “ i must be more careful of his _amour propre_ . and now that we are left to our own devices , what do you think , my good friend , of a little reunion of the family ? ”
christie	ackroyd	the “ little reunion , ” as poirot called it , took place about half an hour later . we sat round the table in the dining-room at fernly—poirot at the head of the table , like the chairman of some ghastly board meeting . the servants were not present , so we were six in all . mrs. ackroyd , flora , major blunt , young raymond , poirot , and myself .
christie	ackroyd	when every one was assembled , poirot rose and bowed . “ messieurs , mesdames , i have called you together for a certain purpose. ” he paused . “ to begin with , i want to make a very special plea to mademoiselle . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ to me ? ” said flora . “ mademoiselle , you are engaged to captain ralph paton . if any one is in his confidence , you are . i beg you , most earnestly , if you know of his whereabouts , to persuade him to come forward . one little minute ” —as flora raised her head to speak— “ say nothing till you have well reflected . mademoiselle , his position grows daily more dangerous . if he had come forward at once , no matter how damning the facts , he might have had a chance of explaining them away . but this silence—this flight—what can it mean ? surely only one thing , knowledge of guilt . mademoiselle , if you really believe in his innocence , persuade him to come forward before it is too late . ”
christie	ackroyd	flora ’ s face had gone very white . “ too late ! ” she repeated , very low . poirot leant forward , looking at her . “ see now , mademoiselle , ” he said very gently , “ it is papa poirot who asks you this . the old papa poirot who has much knowledge and much experience . i would not seek to entrap you , mademoiselle . will you not trust me—and tell me where ralph paton is hiding ? ”
christie	ackroyd	the girl rose , and stood facing him . “ m . poirot , ” she said in a clear voice , “ i swear to you—swear solemnly—that i have no idea where ralph is , and that i have neither seen him nor heard from him either on the day of—of the murder , or since . ”
christie	ackroyd	she sat down again . poirot gazed at her in silence for a minute or two , then he brought his hand down on the table with a sharp rap . “ _bien ! _ that is that , ” he said . his face hardened . “ now i appeal to these others who sit round this table , mrs. ackroyd , major blunt , dr. sheppard , mr. raymond . you are all friends and intimates of the missing man . if you know where ralph paton is hiding , speak out . ”
christie	ackroyd	there was a long silence . poirot looked to each in turn . “ i beg of you , ” he said in a low voice , “ speak out. ” but still there was silence , broken at last by mrs. ackroyd .
christie	ackroyd	“ i must say , ” she observed in a plaintive voice , “ that ralph ’ s absence is most peculiar—most peculiar indeed . not to come forward at such a time . it looks , you know , as though there were something _behind_ it . i can ’ t help thinking , flora dear , that it was a very fortunate thing your engagement was never formally announced . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ mother ! ” cried flora angrily . “ providence , ” declared mrs. ackroyd . “ i have a devout belief in providence—a divinity that shapes our ends , as shakespeare ’ s beautiful line runs. ” “ surely you don ’ t make the almighty directly responsible for thick ankles , mrs. ackroyd , do you ? ” asked geoffrey raymond , his irresponsible laugh ringing out .
christie	ackroyd	his idea was , i think , to loosen the tension , but mrs. ackroyd threw him a glance of reproach and took out her handkerchief . “ flora has been saved a terrible amount of notoriety and unpleasantness . not for a moment that i think dear ralph had anything to do with poor roger ’ s death . i _don ’ t_ think so . but then i have a trusting heart—i always have had , ever since a child . i am loath to believe the worst of any one . but , of course , one must remember that ralph was in several air raids as a young boy . the results are apparent long after , sometimes , they say . people are not responsible for their actions in the least . they lose control , you know , without being able to help it . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ mother , ” cried flora , “ you don ’ t think ralph did it ? ” “ come , mrs. ackroyd , ” said blunt . “ i don ’ t know what to think , ” said mrs. ackroyd tearfully . “ it ’ s all very upsetting . what would happen to the estate , i wonder , if ralph were found guilty ? ”
christie	ackroyd	raymond pushed his chair away from the table violently . major blunt remained very quiet , looking thoughtfully at her . “ like shell-shock , you know , ” said mrs. ackroyd obstinately , “ and i dare say roger kept him very short of money—with the best intentions , of course . i can see you are all against me , but i do think it is very odd that ralph has not come forward , and i must say i am thankful flora ’ s engagement was never announced formally . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ it will be to-morrow , ” said flora in a clear voice . “ flora ! ” cried her mother , aghast . flora had turned to the secretary . “ will you send the announcement to the _morning post_ and the _times_ , please , mr. raymond . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ if you are sure that it is wise , miss ackroyd , ” he replied gravely . she turned impulsively to blunt . “ you understand , ” she said . “ what else can i do ? as things are , i must stand by ralph . don ’ t you see that i must ? ”
christie	ackroyd	she looked very searchingly at him , and after a long pause he nodded abruptly . mrs. ackroyd burst out into shrill protests . flora remained unmoved . then raymond spoke . “ i appreciate your motives , miss ackroyd . but don ’ t you think you ’ re being rather precipitate ? wait a day or two . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ to-morrow , ” said flora , in a clear voice . “ it ’ s no good , mother , going on like this . whatever else i am , i ’ m not disloyal to my friends. ” “ m . poirot , ” mrs. ackroyd appealed tearfully , “ can ’ t you say anything at all ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ nothing to be said , ” interpolated blunt . “ she ’ s doing the right thing . i ’ ll stand by her through thick and thin. ” flora held out her hand to him . “ thank you , major blunt , ” she said .
christie	ackroyd	“ mademoiselle , ” said poirot , “ will you let an old man congratulate you on your courage and your loyalty ? and will you not misunderstand me if i ask you—ask you most solemnly—to postpone the announcement you speak of for at least two days more ? ”
christie	ackroyd	flora hesitated . “ i ask it in ralph paton ’ s interests as much as in yours , mademoiselle . you frown . you do not see how that can be . but i assure you that it is so . _pas de blagues_ . you put the case into my hands—you must not hamper me now . ”
christie	ackroyd	flora paused a few minutes before replying . “ i do not like it , ” she said at last , “ but i will do what you say. ” she sat down again at the table .
christie	ackroyd	“ and now , messieurs et mesdames , ” said poirot rapidly , “ i will continue with what i was about to say . understand this , i mean to arrive at the truth . the truth , however ugly in itself , is always curious and beautiful to the seeker after it . i am much aged , my powers may not be what they were. ” here he clearly expected a contradiction . “ in all probability this is the last case i shall ever investigate . but hercule poirot does not end with a failure . messieurs et mesdames , i tell you , i mean to _know_ . and i shall know—in spite of you all . ”
christie	ackroyd	he brought out the last words provocatively , hurling them in our face as it were . i think we all flinched back a little , excepting geoffrey raymond , who remained good humored and imperturbable as usual .
christie	ackroyd	“ how do you mean—in spite of us all ? ” he asked , with slightly raised eyebrows . “ but—just that , monsieur . every one of you in this room is concealing something from me. ” he raised his hand as a faint murmur of protest arose . “ yes , yes , i know what i am saying . it may be something unimportant—trivial—which is supposed to have no bearing on the case , but there it is . _each one of you has something to hide._ come , now , am i right ? ”
christie	ackroyd	his glance , challenging and accusing , swept round the table . and every pair of eyes dropped before his . yes , mine as well . “ i am answered , ” said poirot , with a curious laugh . he got up from his seat . “ i appeal to you all . tell me the truth—the whole truth. ” there was a silence . “ will no one speak ? ”
christie	ackroyd	he gave the same short laugh again . “ _c ’ est dommage_ , ” he said , and went out . chapter xiii the goose quill that evening , at poirot ’ s request , i went over to his house after dinner . caroline saw me depart with visible reluctance . i think she would have liked to have accompanied me .
christie	ackroyd	poirot greeted me hospitably . he had placed a bottle of irish whisky ( which i detest ) on a small table , with a soda water siphon and a glass . he himself was engaged in brewing hot chocolate . it was a favorite beverage of his , i discovered later .
christie	ackroyd	he inquired politely after my sister , whom he declared to be a most interesting woman . “ i ’ m afraid you ’ ve been giving her a swelled head , ” i said dryly . “ what about sunday afternoon ? ”
christie	ackroyd	he laughed and twinkled . “ i always like to employ the expert , ” he remarked obscurely , but he refused to explain the remark . “ you got all the local gossip anyway , ” i remarked . “ true , and untrue . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ and a great deal of valuable information , ” he added quietly . “ such as—— ? ” he shook his head . “ why not have told me the truth ? ” he countered . “ in a place like this , all ralph paton ’ s doings were bound to be known . if your sister had not happened to pass through the wood that day somebody else would have done so . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i suppose they would , ” i said grumpily . “ what about this interest of yours in my patients ? ” again he twinkled . “ only one of them , doctor . only one of them. ” “ the last ? ” i hazarded .
christie	ackroyd	“ i find miss russell a study of the most interesting , ” he said evasively . “ do you agree with my sister and mrs. ackroyd that there is something fishy about her ? ” i asked .
christie	ackroyd	“ eh ? what do you say—fishy ? ” i explained to the best of my ability . “ and they say that , do they ? ” “ didn ’ t my sister convey as much to you yesterday afternoon ? ” “ _c ’ est possible._ ”
christie	ackroyd	“ for no reason whatever , ” i declared . “ _les femmes_ , ” generalized poirot . “ they are marvelous ! they invent haphazard—and by miracle they are right . not that it is that , really . women observe subconsciously a thousand little details , without knowing that they are doing so . their subconscious mind adds these little things together—and they call the result intuition . me , i am very skilled in psychology . i know these things . ”
christie	ackroyd	he swelled his chest out importantly , looking so ridiculous , that i found it difficult not to burst out laughing . then he took a small sip of his chocolate , and carefully wiped his mustache .
christie	ackroyd	“ i wish you ’ d tell me , ” i burst out , “ what you really think of it all ? ” he put down his cup . “ you wish that ? ” “ i do. ” “ you have seen what i have seen . should not our ideas be the same ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i ’ m afraid you ’ re laughing at me , ” i said stiffly . “ of course , i ’ ve no experience of matters of this kind. ” poirot smiled at me indulgently . “ you are like the little child who wants to know the way the engine works . you wish to see the affair , not as the family doctor sees it , but with the eye of a detective who knows and cares for no one—to whom they are all strangers and all equally liable to suspicion . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ you put it very well , ” i said . “ so i give you then , a little lecture . the first thing is to get a clear history of what happened that evening—always bearing in mind that the person who speaks may be lying . ”
christie	ackroyd	i raised my eyebrows . “ rather a suspicious attitude. ” “ but necessary—i assure you , necessary . now first—dr . sheppard leaves the house at ten minutes to nine . how do i know that ? ” “ because i told you so . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ but you might not be speaking the truth—or the watch you went by might be wrong . but parker also says that you left the house at ten minutes to nine . so we accept that statement and pass on . at nine o ’ clock you run into a man—and here we come to what we will call the romance of the mysterious stranger—just outside the park gates . how do i know that that is so ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i told you so , ” i began again , but poirot interrupted me with a gesture of impatience . “ ah ! but it is that you are a little stupid to-night , my friend . _you_ know that it is so—but how am _i_ to know ? _eh bien_ , i am able to tell you that the mysterious stranger was not a hallucination on your part , because the maid of a miss ganett met him a few minutes before you did , and of her too he inquired the way to fernly park . we accept his presence , therefore , and we can be fairly sure of two things about him—that he was a stranger to the neighborhood , and that whatever his object in going to fernly , there was no great secrecy about it , since he twice asked the way there . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ yes , ” i said , “ i see that. ” “ now i have made it my business to find out more about this man . he had a drink at the three boars , i learn , and the barmaid there says that he spoke with an american accent and mentioned having just come over from the states . did it strike you that he had an american accent ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ yes , i think he had , ” i said , after a minute or two , during which i cast my mind back ; “ but a very slight one. ” “ _précisément._ there is also this which , you will remember , i picked up in the summer-house ? ”
christie	ackroyd	he held out to me the little quill . i looked at it curiously . then a memory of something i had read stirred in me . poirot , who had been watching my face , nodded .
christie	ackroyd	“ yes , heroin ‘ snow. ’ drug-takers carry it like this , and sniff it up the nose. ” “ diamorphine hydrochloride , ” i murmured mechanically . “ this method of taking the drug is very common on the other side . another proof , if we wanted one , that the man came from canada or the states . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ what first attracted your attention to that summer-house ? ” i asked curiously . “ my friend the inspector took it for granted that any one using that path did so as a short cut to the house , but as soon as i saw the summer-house , i realized that the same path would be taken by any one using the summer-house as a rendezvous . now it seems fairly certain that the stranger came neither to the front nor to the back door . then did some one from the house go out and meet him ? if so , what could be a more convenient place than that little summer-house ? i searched it with the hope that i might find some clew inside . i found two , the scrap of cambric and the quill . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ and the scrap of cambric ? ” i asked curiously . “ what about that ? ” poirot raised his eyebrows . “ you do not use your little gray cells , ” he remarked dryly . “ the scrap of starched cambric should be obvious . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ not very obvious to me. ” i changed the subject . “ anyway , ” i said , “ this man went to the summer-house to meet somebody . who was that somebody ? ” “ exactly the question , ” said poirot . “ you will remember that mrs. ackroyd and her daughter came over from canada to live here ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ is that what you meant to-day when you accused them of hiding the truth ? ” “ perhaps . now another point . what did you think of the parlormaid ’ s story ? ” “ what story ? ” “ the story of her dismissal . does it take half an hour to dismiss a servant ? was the story of those important papers a likely one ? and remember , though she says she was in her bedroom from nine-thirty until ten o ’ clock , there is no one to confirm her statement . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ you bewilder me , ” i said . “ to me it grows clearer . but tell me now your own ideas and theories. ” i drew a piece of paper from my pocket . “ i just scribbled down a few suggestions , ” i said apologetically .
christie	ackroyd	“ but excellent—you have method . let us hear them. ” i read out in a somewhat embarrassed voice . “ to begin with , one must look at the thing logically—— ” “ just what my poor hastings used to say , ” interrupted poirot , “ but alas ! he never did so . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ _point no . 1._—mr . ackroyd was heard talking to some one at half-past nine . “ _point no . 2._—at some time during the evening ralph paton must have come in through the window , as evidenced by the prints of his shoes .
christie	ackroyd	“ _point no . 3._—mr . ackroyd was nervous that evening , and would only have admitted some one he knew . “ _point no . 4._—the person with mr. ackroyd at nine-thirty was asking for money . we know ralph paton was in a scrape .
christie	ackroyd	“ _these four points go to show that the person with mr. ackroyd at nine-thirty was ralph paton . but we know that mr. ackroyd was alive at a quarter to ten , therefore it was not ralph who killed him . ralph left the window open . afterwards the murderer came in that way._ ”
christie	ackroyd	“ and who was the murderer ? ” inquired poirot . “ the american stranger . he may have been in league with parker , and possibly in parker we have the man who blackmailed mrs. ferrars . if so , parker may have heard enough to realize the game was up , have told his accomplice so , and the latter did the crime with the dagger which parker gave him . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ it is a theory that , ” admitted poirot . “ decidedly you have cells of a kind . but it leaves a good deal unaccounted for. ” “ such as—— ? ” “ the telephone call , the pushed-out chair—— ”
christie	ackroyd	“ do you really think the latter important ? ” i interrupted . “ perhaps not , ” admitted my friend . “ it may have been pulled out by accident , and raymond or blunt may have shoved it into place unconsciously under the stress of emotion . then there is the missing forty pounds . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ given by ackroyd to ralph , ” i suggested . “ he may have reconsidered his first refusal. ” “ that still leaves one thing unexplained ? ” “ what ? ” “ why was blunt so certain in his own mind that it was raymond with mr. ackroyd at nine-thirty ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ he explained that , ” i said . “ you think so ? i will not press the point . tell me instead , what were ralph paton ’ s reasons for disappearing ? ” “ that ’ s rather more difficult , ” i said slowly . “ i shall have to speak as a medical man . ralph ’ s nerves must have gone phut ! if he suddenly found out that his uncle had been murdered within a few minutes of his leaving him—after , perhaps , a rather stormy interview—well , he might get the wind up and clear right out . men have been known to do that—act guiltily when they ’ re perfectly innocent . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ yes , that is true , ” said poirot . “ but we must not lose sight of one thing. ” “ i know what you ’ re going to say , ” i remarked : “ motive . ralph paton inherits a great fortune by his uncle ’ s death . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ that is one motive , ” agreed poirot . “ one ? ” “ _mais oui._ do you realize that there are three separate motives staring us in the face . somebody certainly stole the blue envelope and its contents . that is one motive . blackmail ! ralph paton may have been the man who blackmailed mrs. ferrars . remember , as far as hammond knew , ralph paton had not applied to his uncle for help of late . that looks as though he were being supplied with money elsewhere . then there is the fact that he was in some—how do you say—scrape ? —which he feared might get to his uncle ’ s ears . and finally there is the one you have just mentioned . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ dear me , ” i said , rather taken aback . “ the case does seem black against him. ” “ does it ? ” said poirot . “ that is where we disagree , you and i . three motives—it is almost too much . i am inclined to believe that , after all , ralph paton is innocent . ”
christie	ackroyd	chapter xiv mrs. ackroyd after the evening talk i have just chronicled , the affair seemed to me to enter on a different phase . the whole thing can be divided into two parts , each clear and distinct from the other . part i. ranges from ackroyd ’ s death on the friday evening to the following monday night . it is the straight-forward narrative of what occurred , as presented to hercule poirot . i was at poirot ’ s elbow the whole time . i saw what he saw . i tried my best to read his mind . as i know now , i failed in this latter task . though poirot showed me all his discoveries—as , for instance , the gold wedding-ring—he held back the vital and yet logical impressions that he formed . as i came to know later , this secrecy was characteristic of him . he would throw out hints and suggestions , but beyond that he would not go .
christie	ackroyd	as i say , up till the monday evening , my narrative might have been that of poirot himself . i played watson to his sherlock . but after monday our ways diverged . poirot was busy on his own account . i got to hear of what he was doing , because , in king ’ s abbot , you get to hear of everything , but he did not take me into his confidence beforehand . and i , too , had my own preoccupations .
christie	ackroyd	on looking back , the thing that strikes me most is the piecemeal character of this period . every one had a hand in the elucidation of the mystery . it was rather like a jig-saw puzzle to which every one contributed their own little piece of knowledge or discovery . but their task ended there . to poirot alone belongs the renown of fitting those pieces into their correct place .
christie	ackroyd	some of the incidents seemed at the time irrelevant and unmeaning . there was , for instance , the question of the black boots . but that comes later .... to take things strictly in chronological order , i must begin with the summons from mrs. ackroyd .
christie	ackroyd	she sent for me early on tuesday morning , and since the summons sounded an urgent one , i hastened there , expecting to find her _in extremis_ . the lady was in bed . so much did she concede to the etiquette of the situation . she gave me her bony hand , and indicated a chair drawn up to the bedside .
christie	ackroyd	“ well , mrs. ackroyd , ” i said , “ and what ’ s the matter with you ? ” i spoke with that kind of spurious geniality which seems to be expected of general practitioners . “ i ’ m prostrated , ” said mrs. ackroyd in a faint voice . “ absolutely prostrated . it ’ s the shock of poor roger ’ s death . they say these things often aren ’ t felt at the _time_ , you know . it ’ s the reaction afterwards . ”
christie	ackroyd	it is a pity that a doctor is precluded by his profession from being able sometimes to say what he really thinks . i would have given anything to be able to answer “ bunkum ! ”
christie	ackroyd	instead , i suggested a tonic . mrs. ackroyd accepted the tonic . one move in the game seemed now to be concluded . not for a moment did i imagine that i had been sent for because of the shock occasioned by ackroyd ’ s death . but mrs. ackroyd is totally incapable of pursuing a straight-forward course on any subject . she always approaches her object by tortuous means . i wondered very much why it was she had sent for me .
christie	ackroyd	“ and then that scene—yesterday , ” continued my patient . she paused as though expecting me to take up a cue . “ what scene ? ” “ doctor , how can you ? have you forgotten ? that dreadful little frenchman—or belgian—or whatever he is . bullying us all like he did . it has quite upset me . coming on top of roger ’ s death . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i ’ m very sorry , mrs. ackroyd , ” i said . “ i don ’ t know what he meant—shouting at us like he did . i should hope i know my duty too well to _dream_ of concealing anything . i have given the police _every_ assistance in my power . ”
christie	ackroyd	mrs. ackroyd paused , and i said , “ quite so. ” i was beginning to have a glimmering of what all the trouble was about . “ no one can say that i have failed in my duty , ” continued mrs. ackroyd . “ i am sure inspector raglan is perfectly satisfied . why should this little upstart of a foreigner make a fuss ? a most ridiculous-looking creature he is too—just like a comic frenchman in a revue . i can ’ t think why flora insisted on bringing him into the case . she never said a word to me about it . just went off and did it on her own . flora is too independent . i am a woman of the world and her mother . she should have come to me for advice first . ”
christie	ackroyd	i listened to all this in silence . “ what does he think ? that ’ s what i want to know . does he actually imagine i ’ m hiding something ? he—he—positively _accused_ me yesterday. ” i shrugged my shoulders .
christie	ackroyd	“ it is surely of no consequence , mrs. ackroyd , ” i said . “ since you are not concealing anything , any remarks he may have made do not apply to you. ” mrs. ackroyd went off at a tangent , after her usual fashion .
christie	ackroyd	“ servants are so tiresome , ” she said . “ they gossip , and talk amongst themselves . and then it gets round—and all the time there ’ s probably nothing in it at all. ” “ have the servants been talking ? ” i asked . “ what about ? ”
christie	ackroyd	mrs. ackroyd cast a very shrewd glance at me . it quite threw me off my balance . “ i was sure _you ’ d_ know , doctor , if any one did . you were with m. poirot all the time , weren ’ t you ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i was. ” “ then of course you know . it was that girl , ursula bourne , wasn ’ t it ? naturally—she ’ s leaving . she _would_ want to make all the trouble she could . spiteful , that ’ s what they are . they ’ re all alike . now , you being there , doctor , you must know exactly what she did say ? i ’ m most anxious that no wrong impression should get about . after all , you don ’ t repeat every little detail to the police , do you ? there are family matters sometimes—nothing to do with the question of the murder . but if the girl was spiteful , she may have made out all sorts of things . ”
christie	ackroyd	i was shrewd enough to see that a very real anxiety lay behind these outpourings . poirot had been justified in his premises . of the six people round the table yesterday , mrs. ackroyd at least had had something to hide . it was for me to discover what that something might be .
christie	ackroyd	“ if i were you , mrs. ackroyd , ” i said brusquely , “ i should make a clean breast of things. ” she gave a little scream . “ oh ! doctor , how can you be so abrupt . it sounds as though—as though——and i can explain everything so simply . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ then why not do so , ” i suggested . mrs. ackroyd took out a frilled handkerchief , and became tearful . “ i thought , doctor , that you might put it to m. poirot—explain it , you know—because it ’ s so difficult for a foreigner to see our point of view . and you don ’ t know—nobody could know—what i ’ ve had to contend with . a martyrdom—a long martyrdom . that ’ s what my life has been . i don ’ t like to speak ill of the dead—but there it is . not the smallest bill , but it had all to be gone over—just as though roger had had a few miserly hundreds a year instead of being ( as mr. hammond told me yesterday ) one of the wealthiest men in these parts . ”
christie	ackroyd	mrs. ackroyd paused to dab her eyes with the frilled handkerchief . “ yes , ” i said encouragingly . “ you were talking about bills ? ” “ those dreadful bills . and some i didn ’ t like to show roger at all . they were things a man wouldn ’ t understand . he would have said the things weren ’ t necessary . and of course they mounted up , you know , and they kept coming in—— ”
christie	ackroyd	she looked at me appealingly , as though asking me to condole with her on this striking peculiarity . “ it ’ s a habit they have , ” i agreed . “ and the tone altered—became quite abusive . i assure you , doctor , i was becoming a nervous wreck . i couldn ’ t sleep at nights . and a dreadful fluttering round the heart . and then i got a letter from a scotch gentleman—as a matter of fact there were two letters—both scotch gentlemen . mr. bruce macpherson was one , and the other were colin macdonald . quite a coincidence . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ hardly that , ” i said dryly . “ they are usually scotch gentlemen , but i suspect a semitic strain in their ancestry. ” “ ten pounds to ten thousand on note of hand alone , ” murmured mrs. ackroyd reminiscently . “ i wrote to one of them , but it seemed there were difficulties . ”
christie	ackroyd	she paused . i gathered that we were just coming to delicate ground . i have never known any one more difficult to bring to the point . “ you see , ” murmured mrs. ackroyd , “ it ’ s all a question of expectations , isn ’ t it ? testamentary expectations . and though , of course , i expected that roger would provide for me , i didn ’ t _know_ . i thought that if only i could glance over a copy of his will—not in any sense of vulgar prying—but just so that i could make my own arrangements . ”
christie	ackroyd	she glanced sideways at me . the position was now very delicate indeed . fortunately words , ingeniously used , will serve to mask the ugliness of naked facts . “ i could only tell this to you , dear dr. sheppard , ” said mrs. ackroyd rapidly . “ i can trust you not to misjudge me , and to represent the matter in the right light to m. poirot . it was on friday afternoon—— ”
christie	ackroyd	she came to a stop and swallowed uncertainly . “ yes , ” i repeated encouragingly . “ on friday afternoon . well ? ” “ every one was out , or so i thought . and i went into roger ’ s study—i had some real reason for going there—i mean , there was nothing underhand about it . and as i saw all the papers heaped on the desk , it just came to me , like a flash : ‘ i wonder if roger keeps his will in one of the drawers of the desk. ’ i ’ m so impulsive , always was , from a child . i do things on the spur of the moment . he ’ d left his keys—very careless of him—in the lock of the top drawer . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i see , ” i said helpfully . “ so you searched the desk . did you find the will ? ” mrs. ackroyd gave a little scream , and i realized that i had not been sufficiently diplomatic .
christie	ackroyd	“ how dreadful it sounds . but it wasn ’ t at all like that really. ” “ of course it wasn ’ t , ” i said hastily . “ you must forgive my unfortunate way of putting things. ” “ you see , men are so peculiar . in dear roger ’ s place , i should not have objected to revealing the provisions of my will . but men are so secretive . one is forced to adopt little subterfuges in self-defence . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ and the result of the little subterfuge ? ” i asked . “ that ’ s just what i ’ m telling you . as i got to the bottom drawer , bourne came in . most awkward . of course i shut the drawer and stood up , and i called her attention to a few specks of dust on the surface . but i didn ’ t like the way she looked—quite respectful in manner , but a very nasty light in her eyes . almost contemptuous , if you know what i mean . i never have liked that girl very much . she ’ s a good servant , and she says ma ’ am , and doesn ’ t object to wearing caps and aprons ( which i declare to you a lot of them do nowadays ) , and she can say ‘ not at home ’ without scruples if she has to answer the door instead of parker , and she doesn ’ t have those peculiar gurgling noises inside which so many parlormaids seem to have when they wait at table——let me see , where was i ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ you were saying , that in spite of several valuable qualities , you never liked bourne. ” “ no more i do . she ’ s—odd . there ’ s something different about her from the others . too well educated , that ’ s my opinion . you can ’ t tell who are ladies and who aren ’ t nowadays . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ and what happened next ? ” i asked . “ nothing . at least , roger came in . and i thought he was out for a walk . and he said : ‘ what ’ s all this ? ’ and i said , ‘ nothing . i just came in to fetch _punch_. ’ and i took _punch_ and went out with it . bourne stayed behind . i heard her asking roger if she could speak to him for a minute . i went straight up to my room , to lie down . i was very upset . ”
christie	ackroyd	there was a pause . “ you will explain to m. poirot , won ’ t you ? you can see for yourself what a trivial matter the whole thing was . but , of course , when he was so stern about concealing things , i thought of this at once . bourne may have made some extraordinary story out of it , but you can explain , can ’ t you ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ that is all ? ” i said . “ you have told me everything ? ” “ ye-es , ” said mrs. ackroyd . “ oh ! yes , ” she added firmly . but i had noted the momentary hesitation , and i knew that there was still something she was keeping back . it was nothing less than a flash of sheer genius that prompted me to ask the question i did .
christie	ackroyd	“ mrs . ackroyd , ” i said , “ was it you who left the silver table open ? ” i had my answer in the blush of guilt that even rouge and powder could not conceal .
christie	ackroyd	“ how did you know ? ” she whispered . “ it was you , then ? ” “ yes—i—you see—there were one or two pieces of old silver—very interesting . i had been reading up the subject and there was an illustration of quite a small piece which had fetched an immense sum at christy ’ s . it looked to me just the same as the one in the silver table . i thought i would take it up to london with me when i went—and—and have it valued . then if it really was a valuable piece , just think what a charming surprise it would have been for roger ? ”
christie	ackroyd	i refrained from comments , accepting mrs. ackroyd ’ s story on its merits . i even forbore to ask her why it was necessary to abstract what she wanted in such a surreptitious manner .
christie	ackroyd	“ why did you leave the lid open ? ” i asked . “ did you forget ? ” “ i was startled , ” said mrs. ackroyd . “ i heard footsteps coming along the terrace outside . i hastened out of the room and just got up the stairs before parker opened the front door to you . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ that must have been miss russell , ” i said thoughtfully . mrs. ackroyd had revealed to me one fact that was extremely interesting . whether her designs upon ackroyd ’ s silver had been strictly honorable i neither knew nor cared . what did interest me was the fact that miss russell must have entered the drawing-room by the window , and that i had not been wrong when i judged her to be out of breath with running . where had she been ? i thought of the summer-house and the scrap of cambric .
christie	ackroyd	“ i wonder if miss russell has her handkerchiefs starched ! ” i exclaimed on the spur of the moment . mrs. ackroyd ’ s start recalled me to myself , and i rose . “ you think you can explain to m. poirot ? ” she asked anxiously .
christie	ackroyd	“ oh , certainly . absolutely. ” i got away at last , after being forced to listen to more justifications of her conduct . the parlormaid was in the hall , and it was she who helped me on with my overcoat . i observed her more closely than i had done heretofore . it was clear that she had been crying .
christie	ackroyd	“ how is it , ” i asked , “ that you told us that mr. ackroyd sent for you on friday to his study ? i hear now that it was _you_ who asked to speak to _him_ ? ”
christie	ackroyd	for a minute the girl ’ s eyes dropped before mine . then she spoke . “ i meant to leave in any case , ” she said uncertainly . i said no more . she opened the front door for me . just as i was passing out , she said suddenly in a low voice : —
christie	ackroyd	“ excuse me , sir , is there any news of captain paton ? ” i shook my head , looking at her inquiringly . “ he ought to come back , ” she said . “ indeed—indeed he ought to come back . ”
christie	ackroyd	she was looking at me with appealing eyes . “ does no one know where he is ? ” she asked . “ do you ? ” i said sharply . she shook her head . “ no , indeed . i know nothing . but any one who was a friend to him would tell him this : he ought to come back . ”
christie	ackroyd	i lingered , thinking that perhaps the girl would say more . her next question surprised me . “ when do they think the murder was done ? just before ten o ’ clock ? ” “ that is the idea , ” i said . “ between a quarter to ten and the hour . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ not earlier ? not before a quarter to ten ? ” i looked at her attentively . she was so clearly eager for a reply in the affirmative . “ that ’ s out of the question , ” i said . “ miss ackroyd saw her uncle alive at a quarter to ten . ”
christie	ackroyd	she turned away , and her whole figure seemed to droop . “ a handsome girl , ” i said to myself as i drove off . “ an exceedingly handsome girl. ” caroline was at home . she had had a visit from poirot and was very pleased and important about it .
christie	ackroyd	“ i am helping him with the case , ” she explained . i felt rather uneasy . caroline is bad enough as it is . what will she be like with her detective instincts encouraged ?
christie	ackroyd	“ are you going round the neighborhood looking for ralph paton ’ s mysterious girl ? ” i inquired . “ i might do that on my own account , ” said caroline . “ no , this is a special thing m. poirot wants me to find out for him . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ what is it ? ” i asked . “ he wants to know whether ralph paton ’ s boots were black or brown , ” said caroline with tremendous solemnity . i stared at her . i see now that i was unbelievably stupid about these boots . i failed altogether to grasp the point .
christie	ackroyd	“ they were brown shoes , ” i said . “ i saw them. ” “ not shoes , james , boots . m. poirot wants to know whether a pair of boots ralph had with him at the hotel were brown or black . a lot hangs on it . ”
christie	ackroyd	call me dense if you like . i didn ’ t see . “ and how are you going to find out ? ” i asked . caroline said there would be no difficulty about that . our annie ’ s dearest friend was miss ganett ’ s maid , clara . and clara was walking out with the boots at the three boars . the whole thing was simplicity itself , and by the aid of miss ganett , who coöperated loyally , at once giving clara leave of absence , the matter was rushed through at express speed .
christie	ackroyd	it was when we were sitting down to lunch that caroline remarked , with would-be unconcern : — “ about those boots of ralph paton ’ s. ” “ well , ” i said , “ what about them ? ” “ m . poirot thought they were probably brown . he was wrong . they ’ re black . ”
christie	ackroyd	and caroline nodded her head several times . she evidently felt that she had scored a point over poirot . i did not answer . i was puzzling over what the color of a pair of ralph paton ’ s boots had to do with the case .
christie	ackroyd	chapter xv geoffrey raymond i was to have a further proof that day of the success of poirot ’ s tactics . that challenge of his had been a subtle touch born of his knowledge of human nature . a mixture of fear and guilt had wrung the truth from mrs. ackroyd . she was the first to react .
christie	ackroyd	that afternoon when i returned from seeing my patients , caroline told me that geoffrey raymond had just left . “ did he want to see me ? ” i asked , as i hung up my coat in the hall .
christie	ackroyd	caroline was hovering by my elbow . “ it was m. poirot he wanted to see , ” she said . “ he ’ d just come from the larches . m. poirot was out . mr. raymond thought that he might be here , or that you might know where he was . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i haven ’ t the least idea. ” “ i tried to make him wait , ” said caroline , “ but he said he would call back at the larches in half an hour , and went away down the village . a great pity , because m. poirot came in practically the minute after he left . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ came in here ? ” “ no , to his own house. ” “ how do you know ? ” “ the side window , ” said caroline briefly . it seemed to me that we had now exhausted the topic . caroline thought otherwise .
christie	ackroyd	“ aren ’ t you going across ? ” “ across where ? ” “ to the larches , of course. ” “ my dear caroline , ” i said , “ what for ? ” “ mr . raymond wanted to see him very particularly , ” said caroline . “ you might hear what it ’ s all about . ”
christie	ackroyd	i raised my eyebrows . “ curiosity is not my besetting sin , ” i remarked coldly . “ i can exist comfortably without knowing exactly what my neighbors are doing and thinking. ” “ stuff and nonsense , james , ” said my sister . “ you want to know just as much as i do . you ’ re not so honest , that ’ s all . you always have to pretend . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ really , caroline , ” i said , and retired into my surgery . ten minutes later caroline tapped at the door and entered . in her hand she held what seemed to be a pot of jam .
christie	ackroyd	“ i wonder , james , ” she said , “ if you would mind taking this pot of medlar jelly across to m. poirot ? i promised it to him . he has never tasted any home-made medlar jelly . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ why can ’ t annie go ? ” i asked coldly . “ she ’ s doing some mending . i can ’ t spare her. ” caroline and i looked at each other . “ very well , ” i said , rising . “ but if i take the beastly thing , i shall just leave it at the door . you understand that ? ”
christie	ackroyd	my sister raised her eyebrows . “ naturally , ” she said . “ who suggested you should do anything else ? ” the honors were with caroline . “ if you _do_ happen to see m. poirot , ” she said , as i opened the front door , “ you might tell him about the boots . ”
christie	ackroyd	it was a most subtle parting shot . i wanted dreadfully to understand the enigma of the boots . when the old lady with the breton cap opened the door to me , i found myself asking if m. poirot was in , quite automatically .
christie	ackroyd	poirot sprang up to meet me , with every appearance of pleasure . “ sit down , my good friend , ” he said . “ the big chair ? this small one ? the room is not too hot , no ? ”
christie	ackroyd	i thought it was stifling , but refrained from saying so . the windows were closed , and a large fire burned in the grate . “ the english people , they have a mania for the fresh air , ” declared poirot . “ the big air , it is all very well outside , where it belongs . why admit it to the house ? but let us not discuss such banalities . you have something for me , yes ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ two things , ” i said . “ first—this—from my sister. ” i handed over the pot of medlar jelly . “ how kind of mademoiselle caroline . she has remembered her promise . and the second thing ? ” “ information—of a kind . ”
christie	ackroyd	and i told him of my interview with mrs. ackroyd . he listened with interest , but not much excitement . “ it clears the ground , ” he said thoughtfully . “ and it has a certain value as confirming the evidence of the housekeeper . she said , you remember , that she found the silver table lid open and closed it down in passing . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ what about her statement that she went into the drawing-room to see if the flowers were fresh ? ” “ ah ! we never took that very seriously , did we , my friend ? it was patently an excuse , trumped up in a hurry , by a woman who felt it urgent to explain her presence—which , by the way , you would probably never have thought of questioning . i considered it possible that her agitation might arise from the fact that she had been tampering with the silver table , but i think now that we must look for another cause . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ yes , ” i said . “ whom did she go out to meet ? and why ? ” “ you think she went to meet some one ? ” “ i do. ” poirot nodded . “ so do i , ” he said thoughtfully .
christie	ackroyd	there was a pause . “ by the way , ” i said , “ i ’ ve got a message for you from my sister . ralph paton ’ s boots were black , not brown. ” i was watching him closely as i gave the message , and i fancied that i saw a momentary flicker of discomposure . if so , it passed almost immediately .
christie	ackroyd	“ she is absolutely positive they are not brown ? ” “ absolutely. ” “ ah ! ” said poirot regretfully . “ that is a pity. ” and he seemed quite crestfallen . he entered into no explanations , but at once started a new subject of conversation .
christie	ackroyd	“ the housekeeper , miss russell , who came to consult you on that friday morning—is it indiscreet to ask what passed at the interview—apart from the medical details , i mean ? ” “ not at all , ” i said . “ when the professional part of the conversation was over , we talked for a few minutes about poisons , and the ease or difficulty of detecting them , and about drug-taking and drug-takers . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ with special reference to cocaine ? ” asked poirot . “ how did you know ? ” i asked , somewhat surprised . for answer , the little man rose and crossed the room to where newspapers were filed . he brought me a copy of the _daily budget_ , dated friday , 16th september , and showed me an article dealing with the smuggling of cocaine . it was a somewhat lurid article , written with an eye to picturesque effect .
christie	ackroyd	“ that is what put cocaine into her head , my friend , ” he said . i would have catechized him further , for i did not quite understand his meaning , but at that moment the door opened and geoffrey raymond was announced .
christie	ackroyd	he came in fresh and debonair as ever , and greeted us both . “ how are you , doctor ? m. poirot , this is the second time i ’ ve been here this morning . i was anxious to catch you . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ perhaps i ’ d better be off , ” i suggested rather awkwardly . “ not on my account , doctor . no , it ’ s just this , ” he went on , seating himself at a wave of invitation from poirot , “ i ’ ve got a confession to make . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ _en verité_ ? ” said poirot , with an air of polite interest . “ oh , it ’ s of no consequence , really . but , as a matter of fact , my conscience has been pricking me ever since yesterday afternoon . you accused us all of keeping back something , m. poirot . i plead guilty . i ’ ve had something up my sleeve . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ and what is that , m. raymond ? ” “ as i say , it ’ s nothing of consequence—just this . i was in debt—badly , and that legacy came in the nick of time . five hundred pounds puts me on my feet again with a little to spare . ”
christie	ackroyd	he smiled at us both with that engaging frankness that made him such a likable youngster . “ you know how it is . suspicious looking policeman—don ’ t like to admit you were hard up for money—think it will look bad to them . but i was a fool , really , because blunt and i were in the billiard room from a quarter to ten onwards , so i ’ ve got a watertight alibi and nothing to fear . still , when you thundered out that stuff about concealing things , i felt a nasty prick of conscience , and i thought i ’ d like to get it off my mind . ”
christie	ackroyd	he got up again and stood smiling at us . “ you are a very wise young man , ” said poirot , nodding at him with approval . “ see you , when i know that any one is hiding things from me , i suspect that the thing hidden may be something very bad indeed . you have done well . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i ’ m glad i ’ m cleared from suspicion , ” laughed raymond . “ i ’ ll be off now. ” “ so that is that , ” i remarked , as the door closed behind the young secretary . “ yes , ” agreed poirot . “ a mere bagatelle—but if he had not been in the billiard room—who knows ? after all , many crimes have been committed for the sake of less than five hundred pounds . it all depends on what sum is sufficient to break a man . a question of the relativity , is it not so ? have you reflected , my friend , that many people in that house stood to benefit by mr. ackroyd ’ s death ? mrs. ackroyd , miss flora , young mr. raymond , the housekeeper , miss russell . only one , in fact , does not , major blunt . ”
christie	ackroyd	his tone in uttering that name was so peculiar that i looked up , puzzled . “ i don ’ t quite understand you ? ” i said . “ two of the people i accused have given me the truth . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ you think major blunt has something to conceal also ? ” “ as for that , ” remarked poirot nonchalantly , “ there is a saying , is there not , that englishmen conceal only one thing—their love ? and major blunt , i should say , is not good at concealments . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ sometimes , ” i said , “ i wonder if we haven ’ t rather jumped to conclusions on one point. ” “ what is that ? ” “ we ’ ve assumed that the blackmailer of mrs. ferrars is necessarily the murderer of mr. ackroyd . mightn ’ t we be mistaken ? ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot nodded energetically . “ very good . very good indeed . i wondered if that idea would come to you . of course it is possible . but we must remember one point . the letter disappeared . still , that , as you say , may not necessarily mean that the murderer took it . when you first found the body , parker may have abstracted the letter unnoticed by you . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ parker ? ” “ yes , parker . i always come back to parker—not as the murderer—no , he did not commit the murder ; but who is more suitable than he as the mysterious scoundrel who terrorized mrs. ferrars ? he may have got his information about mr. ferrars ’ s death from one of the king ’ s paddock servants . at any rate , he is more likely to have come upon it than a casual guest such as blunt , for instance . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ parker might have taken the letter , ” i admitted . “ it wasn ’ t till later that i noticed it was gone. ” “ how much later ? after blunt and raymond were in the room , or before ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i can ’ t remember , ” i said slowly . “ i think it was before—no , afterwards . yes , i ’ m almost sure it was afterwards. ” “ that widens the field to three , ” said poirot thoughtfully . “ but parker is the most likely . it is in my mind to try a little experiment with parker . how say you , my friend , will you accompany me to fernly ? ”
christie	ackroyd	i acquiesced , and we set out at once . poirot asked to see miss ackroyd , and presently flora came to us . “ mademoiselle flora , ” said poirot , “ i have to confide in you a little secret . i am not yet satisfied of the innocence of parker . i propose to make a little experiment with your assistance . i want to reconstruct some of his actions on that night . but we must think of something to tell him—ah ! i have it . i wish to satisfy myself as to whether voices in the little lobby could have been heard outside on the terrace . now , ring for parker , if you will be so good . ”
christie	ackroyd	i did so , and presently the butler appeared , suave as ever . “ you rang , sir ? ” “ yes , my good parker . i have in mind a little experiment . i have placed major blunt on the terrace outside the study window . i want to see if any one there could have heard the voices of miss ackroyd and yourself in the lobby that night . i want to enact that little scene over again . perhaps you would fetch the tray or whatever it was you were carrying ? ”
christie	ackroyd	parker vanished , and we repaired to the lobby outside the study door . presently we heard a chink in the outer hall , and parker appeared in the doorway carrying a tray with a siphon , a decanter of whisky , and two glasses on it .
christie	ackroyd	“ one moment , ” cried poirot , raising his hand and seemingly very excited . “ we must have everything in order . just as it occurred . it is a little method of mine. ” “ a foreign custom , sir , ” said parker . “ reconstruction of the crime they call it , do they not ? ”
christie	ackroyd	he was quite imperturbable as he stood there politely waiting on poirot ’ s orders . “ ah ! he knows something , the good parker , ” cried poirot . “ he has read of these things . now , i beg you , let us have everything of the most exact . you came from the outer hall—so . mademoiselle was—where ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ here , ” said flora , taking up her stand just outside the study door . “ quite right , sir , ” said parker . “ i had just closed the door , ” continued flora . “ yes , miss , ” agreed parker . “ your hand was still on the handle as it is now . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ then _allez_ , ” said poirot . “ play me the little comedy. ” flora stood with her hand on the door handle , and parker came stepping through the door from the hall , bearing the tray .
christie	ackroyd	he stopped just inside the door . flora spoke . “ oh ! parker . mr. ackroyd doesn ’ t want to be disturbed again to-night. ” “ is that right ? ” she added in an undertone . “ to the best of my recollection , miss flora , ” said parker , “ but i fancy you used the word evening instead of night. ” then , raising his voice in a somewhat theatrical fashion : “ very good , miss . shall i lock up as usual ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ yes , please. ” parker retired through the door , flora followed him , and started to ascend the main staircase . “ is that enough ? ” she asked over her shoulder . “ admirable , ” declared the little man , rubbing his hands . “ by the way , parker , are you sure there were two glasses on the tray that evening ? who was the second one for ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i always bring two glasses , sir , ” said parker . “ is there anything further ? ” “ nothing . i thank you. ” parker withdrew , dignified to the last . poirot stood in the middle of the hall frowning . flora came down and joined us .
christie	ackroyd	“ has your experiment been successful ? ” she asked . “ i don ’ t quite understand , you know—— ” poirot smiled admiringly at her . “ it is not necessary that you should , ” he said . “ but tell me , were there indeed two glasses on parker ’ s tray that night ? ”
christie	ackroyd	flora wrinkled her brows a minute . “ i really can ’ t remember , ” she said . “ i think there were . is—is that the object of your experiment ? ” poirot took her hand and patted it .
christie	ackroyd	“ put it this way , ” he said . “ i am always interested to see if people will speak the truth. ” “ and did parker speak the truth ? ” “ i rather think he did , ” said poirot thoughtfully .
christie	ackroyd	a few minutes later saw us retracing our steps to the village . “ what was the point of that question about the glasses ? ” i asked curiously . poirot shrugged his shoulders . “ one must say something , ” he remarked . “ that particular question did as well as any other . ”
christie	ackroyd	i stared at him . “ at any rate , my friend , ” he said more seriously , “ i know now something i wanted to know . let us leave it at that. ” chapter xvi an evening at mah jong
christie	ackroyd	that night we had a little mah jong party . this kind of simple entertainment is very popular in king ’ s abbot . the guests arrive in goloshes and waterproofs after dinner . they partake of coffee and later of cake , sandwiches , and tea .
christie	ackroyd	on this particular night our guests were miss ganett and colonel carter , who lives near the church . a good deal of gossip is handed round at these evenings , sometimes seriously interfering with the game in progress . we used to play bridge—chatty bridge of the worst description . we find mah jong much more peaceful . the irritated demand as to why on earth your partner did not lead a certain card is entirely done away with , and though we still express criticisms frankly , there is not the same acrimonious spirit .
christie	ackroyd	“ very cold evening , eh , sheppard ? ” said colonel carter , standing with his back to the fire . caroline had taken miss ganett to her own room , and was there assisting her to disentangle herself from her many wraps . “ reminds me of the afghan passes . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ indeed ? ” i said politely . “ very mysterious business this about poor ackroyd , ” continued the colonel , accepting a cup of coffee . “ a deuce of a lot behind it—that ’ s what i say . between you and me , sheppard , i ’ ve heard the word blackmail mentioned ! ”
christie	ackroyd	the colonel gave me the look which might be tabulated “ one man of the world to another. ” “ a woman in it , no doubt , ” he said . “ depend upon it , a woman in it . ”
christie	ackroyd	caroline and miss ganett joined us at this minute . miss ganett drank coffee whilst caroline got out the mah jong box and poured out the tiles upon the table . “ washing the tiles , ” said the colonel facetiously . “ that ’ s right—washing the tiles , as we used to say in the shanghai club . ”
christie	ackroyd	it is the private opinion of both caroline and myself that colonel carter has never been in the shanghai club in his life . more , that he has never been farther east than india , where he juggled with tins of bully beef and plum and apple jam during the great war . but the colonel is determinedly military , and in king ’ s abbot we permit people to indulge their little idiosyncrasies freely .
christie	ackroyd	“ shall we begin ? ” said caroline . we sat round the table . for some five minutes there was complete silence , owing to the fact that there is tremendous secret competition amongst us as to who can build their wall quickest .
christie	ackroyd	“ go on , james , ” said caroline at last . “ you ’ re east wind. ” i discarded a tile . a round or two proceeded , broken by the monotonous remarks of “ three bamboos , ” “ two circles , ” “ pung , ” and frequently from miss ganett “ unpung , ” owing to that lady ’ s habit of too hastily claiming tiles to which she had no right .
christie	ackroyd	“ i saw flora ackroyd this morning , ” said miss ganett . “ pung—no—unpung . i made a mistake. ” “ four circles , ” said caroline . “ where did you see her ? ” “ she didn ’ t see _me_ , ” said miss ganett , with that tremendous significance only to be met with in small villages .
christie	ackroyd	“ ah ! ” said caroline interestedly . “ chow. ” “ i believe , ” said miss ganett , temporarily diverted , “ that it ’ s the right thing nowadays to say ‘ chee ’ not ‘ chow. ’ ” “ nonsense , ” said caroline . “ i have always said ‘ _chow_ . ’ ”
christie	ackroyd	“ in the shanghai club , ” said colonel carter , “ they say ‘ _chow_. ’ ” miss ganett retired , crushed . “ what were you saying about flora ackroyd ? ” asked caroline , after a moment or two devoted to the game . “ was she with any one ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ very much so , ” said miss ganett . the eyes of the two ladies met , and seemed to exchange information . “ really , ” said caroline interestedly . “ is that it ? well , it doesn ’ t surprise me in the least . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ we ’ re waiting for you to discard , miss caroline , ” said the colonel . he sometimes affects the pose of the bluff male , intent on the game and indifferent to gossip . but nobody is deceived .
christie	ackroyd	“ if you ask me , ” said miss ganett . ( “ was that a bamboo you discarded , dear ? oh ! no , i see now—it was a circle . ) as i was saying , if you ask me , flora ’ s been exceedingly lucky . exceedingly lucky she ’ s been . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ how ’ s that , miss ganett ? ” asked the colonel . “ i ’ ll pung that green dragon . how do you make out that miss flora ’ s been lucky ? very charming girl and all that , i know . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i mayn ’ t know very much about crime , ” said miss ganett , with the air of one who knows everything there is to know , “ but i can tell you one thing . the first question that ’ s always asked is ‘ who last saw the deceased alive ? ’ and the person who did is regarded with suspicion . now , flora ackroyd last saw her uncle alive . it might have looked very nasty for her—very nasty indeed . it ’ s my opinion—and i give it for what it ’ s worth , that ralph paton is staying away on her account , to draw suspicion away from her . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ come , now , ” i protested mildly , “ you surely can ’ t suggest that a young girl like flora ackroyd is capable of stabbing her uncle in cold blood ? ” “ well , i don ’ t know , ” said miss ganett . “ i ’ ve just been reading a book from the library about the underworld of paris , and it says that some of the worst women criminals are young girls with the faces of angels . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ that ’ s in france , ” said caroline instantly . “ just so , ” said the colonel . “ now , i ’ ll tell you a very curious thing—a story that was going round the bazaars in india .... ” the colonel ’ s story was one of interminable length , and of curiously little interest . a thing that happened in india many years ago can not compare for a moment with an event that took place in king ’ s abbot the day before yesterday .
christie	ackroyd	it was caroline who brought the colonel ’ s story to a close by fortunately going mah jong . after the slight unpleasantness always occasioned by my corrections of caroline ’ s somewhat faulty arithmetic , we started a new hand .
christie	ackroyd	“ east wind passes , ” said caroline . “ i ’ ve got an idea of my own about ralph paton . three characters . but i ’ m keeping it to myself for the present. ” “ are you , dear ? ” said miss ganett . “ chow—i mean pung . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ yes , ” said caroline firmly . “ was it all right about the boots ? ” asked miss ganett . “ their being black , i mean ? ” “ quite all right , ” said caroline . “ what was the point , do you think ? ” asked miss ganett .
christie	ackroyd	caroline pursed up her lips , and shook her head with an air of knowing all about it . “ pung , ” said miss ganett . “ no—unpung . i suppose that now the doctor ’ s in with m. poirot he knows all the secrets ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ far from it , ” i said . “ james is so modest , ” said caroline . “ ah ! a concealed kong. ” the colonel gave vent to a whistle . for the moment gossip was forgotten . “ your own wind , too , ” he said . “ _and_ you ’ ve got two pungs of dragons . we must be careful . miss caroline ’ s out for a big hand . ”
christie	ackroyd	we played for some minutes with no irrelevant conversation . “ this m. poirot now , ” said colonel carter , “ is he really such a great detective ? ” “ the greatest the world has ever known , ” said caroline solemnly . “ he had to come here incognito to avoid publicity . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ chow , ” said miss ganett . “ quite wonderful for our little village , i ’ m sure . by the way , clara—my maid , you know—is great friends with elsie , the housemaid at fernly , and what do you think elsie told her ? that there ’ s been a lot of money stolen , and it ’ s her opinion—elsie ’ s—i mean , that the parlormaid had something to do with it . she ’ s leaving at the month , and she ’ s crying a good deal at night . if you ask me , the girl is very likely in league with a _gang_ . she ’ s always been a queer girl—she ’ s not friends with any of the girls round here . she goes off by herself on her days out—very unnatural , i call it , and most suspicious . i asked her once to come to our girls ’ friendly evenings , but she refused , and then i asked her a few questions about her home and her family—all that sort of thing , and i ’ m bound to say i considered her manner most impertinent . outwardly very respectful—but she shut me up in the most barefaced way . ”
christie	ackroyd	miss ganett stopped for breath , and the colonel , who was totally uninterested in the servant question , remarked that in the shanghai club brisk play was the invariable rule . we had a round of brisk play .
christie	ackroyd	“ that miss russell , ” said caroline . “ she came here pretending to consult james on friday morning . it ’ s my opinion she wanted to see where the poisons were kept . five characters. ” “ chow , ” said miss ganett . “ what an extraordinary idea ? i wonder if you can be right . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ talking of poisons , ” said the colonel . “ eh—what ? haven ’ t i discarded ? oh ! eight bamboos. ” “ mah jong ! ” said miss ganett . caroline was very much annoyed . “ one red dragon , ” she said regretfully , “ and i should have had a hand of three doubles . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i ’ ve had two red dragons all the time , ” i mentioned . “ so exactly like you , james , ” said caroline reproachfully . “ you ’ ve no conception of the spirit of the game. ” i myself thought i had played rather cleverly . i should have had to pay caroline an enormous amount if she had gone mah jong . miss ganett ’ s mah jong was of the poorest variety possible , as caroline did not fail to point out to her .
christie	ackroyd	east wind passed , and we started a new hand in silence . “ what i was going to tell you just now was this , ” said caroline . “ yes ? ” said miss ganett encouragingly . “ my idea about ralph paton , i mean . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ yes , dear , ” said miss ganett , still more encouragingly . “ chow ! ” “ it ’ s a sign of weakness to chow so early , ” said caroline severely . “ you should go for a big hand. ” “ i know , ” said miss ganett . “ you were saying—about ralph paton , you know ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ yes . well , i ’ ve a pretty shrewd idea where he is. ” we all stopped to stare at her . “ this is very interesting , miss caroline , ” said colonel carter . “ all your own idea , eh ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ well , not exactly . i ’ ll tell you about it . you know that big map of the county we have in the hall ? ” we all said yes . “ as m. poirot was going out the other day , he stopped and looked at it , and he made some remark—i can ’ t remember exactly what it was . something about cranchester being the only big town anywhere near us—which is true , of course . but after he had gone—it came to me suddenly . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ what came to you ? ” “ his meaning . of course ralph is in cranchester. ” it was at that moment that i knocked down the rack that held my pieces . my sister immediately reproved me for clumsiness , but half-heartedly . she was intent on her theory .
christie	ackroyd	“ cranchester , miss caroline ? ” said colonel carter . “ surely not cranchester ! it ’ s so near. ” “ that ’ s exactly it , ” cried caroline triumphantly . “ it seems quite clear by now that he didn ’ t get away from here by train . he must simply have walked into cranchester . and i believe he ’ s there still . no one would dream of his being so near at hand . ”
christie	ackroyd	i pointed out several objections to the theory , but when once caroline has got something firmly into her head , nothing dislodges it . “ and you think m. poirot has the same idea , ” said miss ganett thoughtfully . “ it ’ s a curious coincidence , but i was out for a walk this afternoon on the cranchester road , and he passed me in a car coming from that direction . ”
christie	ackroyd	we all looked at each other . “ why , dear me , ” said miss ganett suddenly , “ i ’ m mah jong all the time , and i never noticed it. ” caroline ’ s attention was distracted from her own inventive exercises . she pointed out to miss ganett that a hand consisting of mixed suits and too many chows was hardly worth going mah jong on . miss ganett listened imperturbably and collected her counters .
christie	ackroyd	“ yes , dear , i know what you mean , ” she said . “ but it rather depends on what kind of a hand you have to start with , doesn ’ t it ? ” “ you ’ ll never get the big hands if you don ’ t go for them , ” urged caroline .
christie	ackroyd	“ well , we must all play our own way , mustn ’ t we ? ” said miss ganett . she looked down at her counters . “ after all , i ’ m up , so far. ” caroline , who was considerably down , said nothing .
christie	ackroyd	east wind passed , and we set to once more . annie brought in the tea things . caroline and miss ganett were both slightly ruffled as is often the case during one of these festive evenings .
christie	ackroyd	“ if you would only play a leetle quicker , dear , ” said caroline , as miss ganett hesitated over her discard . “ the chinese put down the tiles so quickly it sounds like little birds pattering . ”
christie	ackroyd	for some few minutes we played like the chinese . “ you haven ’ t contributed much to the sum of information , sheppard , ” said colonel carter genially . “ you ’ re a sly dog . hand in glove with the great detective , and not a hint as to the way things are going . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ james is an extraordinary creature , ” said caroline . “ he can _not_ bring himself to part with information. ” she looked at me with some disfavor . “ i assure you , ” i said , “ that i don ’ t know anything . poirot keeps his own counsel . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ wise man , ” said the colonel with a chuckle . “ he doesn ’ t give himself away . but they ’ re wonderful fellows , these foreign detectives . up to all sorts of dodges , i believe. ” “ pung , ” said miss ganett , in a tone of quiet triumph . “ and mah jong . ”
christie	ackroyd	the situation became more strained . it was annoyance at miss ganett ’ s going mah jong for the third time running which prompted caroline to say to me as we built a fresh wall : —
christie	ackroyd	“ you are too tiresome , james . you sit there like a dead head , and say nothing at all ! ” “ but , my dear , ” i protested , “ i have really nothing to say—that is , of the kind you mean . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ nonsense , ” said caroline , as she sorted her hand . “ you _must_ know something interesting. ” i did not answer for a moment . i was overwhelmed and intoxicated . i had read of there being such a thing as the perfect winning—going mah jong on one ’ s original hand . i had never hoped to hold the hand myself .
christie	ackroyd	with suppressed triumph i laid my hand face upwards on the table . “ as they say in the shanghai club , ” i remarked , “ tin-ho—the perfect winning ! ” the colonel ’ s eyes nearly bulged out of his head .
christie	ackroyd	“ upon my soul , ” he said . “ what an extraordinary thing . i never saw that happen before ! ” it was then that i went on , goaded by caroline ’ s gibes , and rendered reckless by my triumph .
christie	ackroyd	“ and as to anything interesting , ” i said . “ what about a gold wedding ring with a date and ‘ from r. ’ inside. ” i pass over the scene that followed . i was made to say exactly where this treasure was found . i was made to reveal the date .
christie	ackroyd	“ march 13th , ” said caroline . “ just six months ago . ah ! ” out of the babel of excited suggestions and suppositions three theories were evolved : — 1 . that of colonel carter : that ralph was secretly married to flora . the first or most simple solution .
christie	ackroyd	2 . that of miss ganett : that roger ackroyd had been secretly married to mrs. ferrars . 3 . that of my sister : that roger ackroyd had married his housekeeper , miss russell . a fourth or super-theory was propounded by caroline later as we went up to bed .
christie	ackroyd	“ mark my words , ” she said suddenly , “ i shouldn ’ t be at all surprised if geoffrey raymond and flora weren ’ t married. ” “ surely it would be ‘ from g , ’ not ‘ from r ’ then , ” i suggested .
christie	ackroyd	“ you never know . some girls call men by their surnames . and you heard what miss ganett said this evening—about flora ’ s carryings on. ” strictly speaking , i had not heard miss ganett say anything of the kind , but i respected caroline ’ s knowledge of innuendoes .
christie	ackroyd	“ how about hector blunt , ” i hinted . “ if it ’ s anybody—— ” “ nonsense , ” said caroline . “ i dare say he admires her—may even be in love with her . but depend upon it a girl isn ’ t going to fall in love with a man old enough to be her father when there ’ s a good-looking young secretary about . she may encourage major blunt just as a blind . girls are very artful . but there ’ s one thing i _do_ tell you , james sheppard . flora ackroyd does not care a penny piece for ralph paton , and never has . you can take it from me . ”
christie	ackroyd	i took it from her meekly . chapter xvii parker it occurred to me the next morning that under the exhilaration produced by tin-ho , or the perfect winning , i might have been slightly indiscreet . true , poirot had not asked me to keep the discovery of the ring to myself . on the other hand , he had said nothing about it whilst at fernly , and as far as i knew , i was the only person aware that it had been found . i felt distinctly guilty . the fact was by now spreading through king ’ s abbot like wildfire . i was expecting wholesale reproaches from poirot any minute .
christie	ackroyd	the joint funeral of mrs. ferrars and roger ackroyd was fixed for eleven o ’ clock . it was a melancholy and impressive ceremony . all the party from fernly were there . after it was over , poirot , who had also been present , took me by the arm , and invited me to accompany him back to the larches . he was looking very grave , and i feared that my indiscretion of the night before had got round to his ears . but it soon transpired that his thoughts were occupied by something of a totally different nature .
christie	ackroyd	“ see you , ” he said . “ we must act . with your help i propose to examine a witness . we will question him , we will put such fear into him that the truth is bound to come out . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ what witness are you talking of ? ” i asked , very much surprised . “ parker ! ” said poirot . “ i asked him to be at my house this morning at twelve o ’ clock . he should await us there at this very minute . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ what do you think , ” i ventured , glancing sideways at his face . “ i know this—that i am not satisfied. ” “ you think that it was he who blackmailed mrs. ferrars ? ” “ either that , or—— ”
christie	ackroyd	“ well ? ” i said , after waiting a minute or two . “ my friend , i will say this to you—i hope it was he. ” the gravity of his manner , and something indefinable that tinged it , reduced me to silence .
christie	ackroyd	on arrival at the larches , we were informed that parker was already there awaiting our return . as we entered the room , the butler rose respectfully . “ good morning , parker , ” said poirot pleasantly . “ one instant , i pray of you . ”
christie	ackroyd	he removed his overcoat and gloves . “ allow me , sir , ” said parker , and sprang forward to assist him . he deposited the articles neatly on a chair by the door . poirot watched him with approval .
christie	ackroyd	“ thank you , my good parker , ” he said . “ take a seat , will you not ? what i have to say may take some time. ” parker seated himself with an apologetic bend of the head .
christie	ackroyd	“ now what do you think i asked you to come here for this morning—eh ? ” parker coughed . “ i understood , sir , that you wished to ask me a few questions about my late master—private like . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ _précisément_ , ” said poirot , beaming . “ have you made many experiments in blackmail ? ” “ sir ! ” the butler sprang to his feet . “ do not excite yourself , ” said poirot placidly . “ do not play the farce of the honest , injured man . you know all there is to know about the blackmail , is it not so ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ sir , i—i ’ ve never—never been—— ” “ insulted , ” suggested poirot , “ in such a way before . then why , my excellent parker , were you so anxious to overhear the conversation in mr. ackroyd ’ s study the other evening , after you had caught the word blackmail ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i wasn ’ t—i—— ” “ who was your last master ? ” rapped out poirot suddenly . “ my last master ? ” “ yes , the master you were with before you came to mr. ackroyd. ” “ a major ellerby , sir—— ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot took the words out of his mouth . “ just so , major ellerby . major ellerby was addicted to drugs , was he not ? you traveled about with him . when he was in bermuda there was some trouble—a man was killed . major ellerby was partly responsible . it was hushed up . but you knew about it . how much did major ellerby pay you to keep your mouth shut ? ”
christie	ackroyd	parker was staring at him open-mouthed . the man had gone to pieces , his cheeks shook flabbily . “ you see , me , i have made inquiries , ” said poirot pleasantly . “ it is as i say . you got a good sum then as blackmail , and major ellerby went on paying you until he died . now i want to hear about your latest experiment . ”
christie	ackroyd	parker still stared . “ it is useless to deny . hercule poirot _knows_ . it is so , what i have said about major ellerby , is it not ? ” as though against his will , parker nodded reluctantly once . his face was ashen pale .
christie	ackroyd	“ but i never hurt a hair of mr. ackroyd ’ s head , ” he moaned . “ honest to god , sir , i didn ’ t . i ’ ve been afraid of this coming all the time . and i tell you i didn ’ t—i didn ’ t kill him . ”
christie	ackroyd	his voice rose almost to a scream . “ i am inclined to believe you , my friend , ” said poirot . “ you have not the nerve—the courage . but i must have the truth. ” “ i ’ ll tell you anything , sir , anything you want to know . it ’ s true that i tried to listen that night . a word or two i heard made me curious . and mr. ackroyd ’ s wanting not to be disturbed , and shutting himself up with the doctor the way he did . it ’ s god ’ s own truth what i told the police . i heard the word blackmail , sir , and well—— ”
christie	ackroyd	he paused . “ you thought there might be something in it for you ? ” suggested poirot smoothly . “ well—well , yes , i did , sir . i thought that if mr. ackroyd was being blackmailed , why shouldn ’ t i have a share of the pickings ? ”
christie	ackroyd	a very curious expression passed over poirot ’ s face . he leaned forward . “ had you any reason to suppose before that night that mr. ackroyd was being blackmailed ? ” “ no , indeed , sir . it was a great surprise to me . such a regular gentleman in all his habits . ”
christie	poirot	“ _mon dieu_ , ” said poirot , in a very low voice , “ i do not understand this . it is horrible . tell me , monsieur , there is no doubt that it was tetanus ? ” “ i believe not . but dr. ames will tell you more than i can do . ”
christie	poirot	“ ah , of course , you are not the doctor. ” “ my name is tosswill. ” this , then , was the british expert described by lady willard as being a minor official at the british museum . there was something at once grave and steadfast about him that took my fancy .
christie	poirot	“ if you will come with me , ” continued dr. tosswill , “ i will take you to sir guy willard . he was most anxious to be informed as soon as you should arrive . ”
christie	poirot	we were taken across the camp to a large tent . dr. tosswill lifted up the flap and we entered . three men were sitting inside . “ monsieur poirot and captain hastings have arrived , sir guy , ” said tosswill .
christie	poirot	the youngest of the three men jumped up and came forward to greet us . there was a certain impulsiveness in his manner which reminded me of his mother . he was not nearly so sunburnt as the others , and that fact , coupled with a certain haggardness round the eyes , made him look older than his twenty-two years . he was clearly endeavouring to bear up under a severe mental strain .
christie	poirot	he introduced his two companions , dr. ames , a capable looking man of thirty odd , with a touch of greying hair at the temples , and mr. harper , the secretary , a pleasant lean young man wearing the national insignia of horn-rimmed spectacles .
christie	poirot	after a few minutes ’ desultory conversation the latter went out , and dr. tosswill followed him . we were left alone with sir guy and dr. ames . “ please ask any questions you want to ask , monsieur poirot , ” said willard . “ we are utterly dumbfounded at this strange series of disasters , but it isn ’ t—it can ’ t be , anything but coincidence . ”
christie	poirot	there was a nervousness about his manner which rather belied the words . i saw that poirot was studying him keenly . “ your heart is really in this work , sir guy ? ” “ rather . no matter what happens , or what comes of it , the work is going on . make up your mind to that . ”
christie	poirot	poirot wheeled round on the other . “ what have you to say to that , _monsieur le docteur_ ? ” “ well , ” drawled the doctor , “ i ’ m not for quitting myself. ” poirot made one of those expressive grimaces of his .
christie	poirot	“ then , _évidemment_ , we must find out just how we stand . when did mr. schneider ’ s death take place ? ” “ three days ago. ” “ you are sure it was tetanus ? ” “ dead sure. ” “ it couldn ’ t have been a case of strychnine poisoning , for instance ? ”
christie	poirot	“ no , monsieur poirot . i see what you ’ re getting at . but it was a clear case of tetanus. ” “ did you not inject anti-serum ? ” “ certainly we did , ” said the doctor dryly . “ every conceivable thing that could be done was tried . ”
christie	poirot	“ had you the anti-serum with you ? ” “ no . we procured it from cairo. ” “ have there been any other cases of tetanus in the camp ? ” “ no , not one. ” “ are you certain that the death of mr. bleibner was not due to tetanus ? ”
christie	poirot	“ absolutely plumb certain . he had a scratch upon his thumb which became poisoned , and septicæmia set in . it sounds pretty much the same to a layman , i dare say , but the two things are entirely different . ”
christie	poirot	“ then we have four deaths—all totally dissimilar , one heart failure , one blood poisoning , one suicide and one tetanus. ” “ exactly , monsieur poirot. ” “ are you certain that there is nothing which might link the four together ? ”
christie	poirot	“ i don ’ t quite understand you ? ” “ i will put it plainly . was any act committed by those four men which might seem to denote disrespect to the spirit of men-her-ra ? ” the doctor gazed at poirot in astonishment .
christie	poirot	“ you ’ re talking through your hat , monsieur poirot . surely you ’ ve not been guyed into believing all that fool talk ? ” “ absolute nonsense , ” muttered willard angrily . poirot remained placidly immovable , blinking a little out of his green cat ’ s eyes .
christie	poirot	“ so you do not believe it , _monsieur le docteur_ ? ” “ no , sir , i do not , ” declared the doctor emphatically . “ i am a scientific man , and i believe only what science teaches . ”
christie	poirot	“ was there no science then in ancient egypt ? ” asked poirot softly . he did not wait for a reply , and indeed dr. ames seemed rather at a loss for the moment . “ no , no , do not answer me , but tell me this . what do the native workmen think ? ”
christie	poirot	“ i guess , ” said dr. ames , “ that , where white folk lose their heads , natives aren ’ t going to be far behind . i ’ ll admit that they ’ re getting what you might call scared—but they ’ ve no cause to be . ”
christie	poirot	“ i wonder , ” said poirot non-committally . sir guy leant forward . “ surely , ” he cried incredulously , “ you can not believe in—oh , but the thing ’ s absurd ! you can know nothing of ancient egypt if you think that . ”
christie	poirot	for answer poirot produced a little book from his pocket—an ancient tattered volume . as he held it out i saw its title , _the magic of the egyptians and chaldeans_ . then , wheeling round , he strode out of the tent . the doctor stared at me .
christie	poirot	“ what is his little idea ? ” the phrase , so familiar on poirot ’ s lips , made me smile as it came from another . “ i don ’ t know exactly , ” i confessed . “ he ’ s got some plan of exorcizing the evil spirits , i believe . ”
christie	poirot	i went in search of poirot , and found him talking to the lean-faced young man who had been the late mr. bleibner ’ s secretary . “ no , ” mr. harper was saying , “ i ’ ve only been six months with the expedition . yes , i knew mr. bleibner ’ s affairs pretty well . ”
christie	poirot	“ can you recount to me anything concerning his nephew ? ” “ he turned up here one day , not a bad-looking fellow . i ’ d never met him before , but some of the others had—ames , i think , and schneider . the old man wasn ’ t at all pleased to see him . they were at it in no time , hammer and tongs . ‘ not a cent , ’ the old man shouted . ‘ not one cent now or when i ’ m dead . i intend to leave my money to the furtherance of my life ’ s work . i ’ ve been talking it over with mr. schneider to-day. ’ and a bit more of the same . young bleibner lit out for cairo right away . ”
christie	poirot	“ was he in perfectly good health at the time ? ” “ the old man ? ” “ no , the young one. ” “ i believe he did mention there was something wrong with him . but it couldn ’ t have been anything serious , or i should have remembered . ”
christie	poirot	“ one thing more , has mr. bleibner left a will ? ” “ so far as we know , he has not. ” “ are you remaining with the expedition , mr. harper ? ” “ no , sir , i am not . i ’ m for new york as soon as i can square up things here . you may laugh if you like , but i ’ m not going to be this blasted old men-her-ra ’ s next victim . he ’ ll get me if i stop here . ”
christie	poirot	the young man wiped the perspiration from his brow . poirot turned away . over his shoulder he said with a peculiar smile : “ remember , he got one of his victims in new york . ”
christie	poirot	“ oh , hell ! ” said mr. harper forcibly . “ that young man is nervous , ” said poirot thoughtfully . “ he is on the edge , but absolutely on the edge. ” i glanced at poirot curiously , but his enigmatical smile told me nothing . in company with sir guy willard and dr. tosswill we were taken round the excavations . the principal finds had been removed to cairo , but some of the tomb furniture was extremely interesting . the enthusiasm of the young baronet was obvious , but i fancied that i detected a shade of nervousness in his manner as though he could not quite escape from the feeling of menace in the air . as we entered the tent which had been assigned to us , for a wash before joining the evening meal , a tall dark figure in white robes stood aside to let us pass with a graceful gesture and a murmured greeting in arabic . poirot stopped .
christie	poirot	“ you are hassan , the late sir john willard ’ s servant ? ” “ i served my lord sir john , now i serve his son. ” he took a step nearer to us and lowered his voice . “ you are a wise one , they say , learned in dealing with evil spirits . let the young master depart from here . there is evil in the air around us . ”
christie	poirot	and with an abrupt gesture , not waiting for a reply , he strode away . “ evil in the air , ” muttered poirot . “ yes , i feel it. ” our meal was hardly a cheerful one . the floor was left to dr. tosswill , who discoursed at length upon egyptian antiquities . just as we were preparing to retire to rest , sir guy caught poirot by the arm and pointed . a shadowy figure was moving amidst the tents . it was no human one : i recognized distinctly the dog-headed figure i had seen carved on the walls of the tomb .
christie	poirot	my blood literally froze at the sight . “ _mon dieu ! _ ” murmured poirot , crossing himself vigorously . “ anubis , the jackal-headed , the god of departing souls. ” “ some one is hoaxing us , ” cried dr. tosswill , rising indignantly to his feet .
christie	poirot	“ it went into your tent , harper , ” muttered sir guy , his face dreadfully pale . “ no , ” said poirot , shaking his head , “ into that of the dr. ames. ” the doctor stared at him incredulously ; then , repeating dr. tosswill ’ s words , he cried :
christie	poirot	“ some one is hoaxing us . come , we ’ ll soon catch the fellow. ” he dashed energetically in pursuit of the shadowy apparition . i followed him , but , search as we would , we could find no trace of any living soul having passed that way . we returned , somewhat disturbed in mind , to find poirot taking energetic measures , in his own way , to ensure his personal safety . he was busily surrounding our tent with various diagrams and inscriptions which he was drawing in the sand . i recognized the five-pointed star or pentagon many times repeated . as was his wont , poirot was at the same time delivering an impromptu lecture on witchcraft and magic in general , white magic as opposed to black , with various references to the ka and the book of the dead thrown in .
christie	poirot	it appeared to excite the liveliest contempt in dr. tosswill , who drew me aside , literally snorting with rage . “ balderdash , sir , ” he exclaimed angrily . “ pure balderdash . the man ’ s an impostor . he doesn ’ t know the difference between the superstitions of the middle ages and the beliefs of ancient egypt . never have i heard such a hotch-potch of ignorance and credulity . ”
christie	poirot	i calmed the excited expert , and joined poirot in the tent . my little friend was beaming cheerfully . “ we can now sleep in peace , ” he declared happily . “ and i can do with some sleep . my head , it aches abominably . ah , for a good _tisane_ ! ”
christie	poirot	as though in answer to prayer , the flap of the tent was lifted and hassan appeared , bearing a steaming cup which he offered to poirot . it proved to be camomile tea , a beverage of which he is inordinately fond . having thanked hassan and refused his offer of another cup for myself , we were left alone once more . i stood at the door of the tent some time after undressing , looking out over the desert .
christie	poirot	“ a wonderful place , ” i said aloud , “ and a wonderful work . i can feel the fascination . this desert life , this probing into the heart of a vanished civilization . surely , poirot , you , too , must feel the charm ? ”
christie	poirot	i got no answer , and i turned , a little annoyed . my annoyance was quickly changed to concern . poirot was lying back across the rude couch , his face horribly convulsed . beside him was the empty cup . i rushed to his side , then dashed out and across the camp to dr. ames ’ s tent .
christie	poirot	“ dr . ames ! ” i cried . “ come at once. ” “ what ’ s the matter ? ” said the doctor , appearing in pyjamas . “ my friend . he ’ s ill . dying . the camomile tea . don ’ t let hassan leave the camp . ”
christie	poirot	like a flash the doctor ran to our tent . poirot was lying as i left him . “ extraordinary , ” cried ames . “ looks like a seizure—or—what did you say about something he drank ? ” he picked up the empty cup .
christie	poirot	“ only i did not drink it ! ” said a placid voice . we turned in amazement . poirot was sitting up on the bed . he was smiling . “ no , ” he said gently . “ i did not drink it . while my good friend hastings was apostrophizing the night , i took the opportunity of pouring it , not down my throat , but into a little bottle . that little bottle will go to the analytical chemist . no ” —as the doctor made a sudden movement— “ as a sensible man , you will understand that violence will be of no avail . during hastings ’ brief absence to fetch you , i have had time to put the bottle in safe keeping . ah , quick , hastings , hold him ! ”
christie	poirot	i misunderstood poirot ’ s anxiety . eager to save my friend , i flung myself in front of him . but the doctor ’ s swift movement had another meaning . his hand went to his mouth , a smell of bitter almonds filled the air , and he swayed forward and fell .
christie	poirot	“ another victim , ” said poirot gravely , “ but the last . perhaps it is the best way . he has three deaths on his head. ” “ dr . ames ? ” i cried , stupefied . “ but i thought you believed in some occult influence ? ”
christie	poirot	“ you misunderstood me , hastings . what i meant was that i believe in the terrific force of superstition . once get it firmly established that a series of deaths are supernatural , and you might almost stab a man in broad daylight , and it would still be put down to the curse , so strongly is the instinct of the supernatural implanted in the human race . i suspected from the first that a man was taking advantage of that instinct . the idea came to him , i imagine , with the death of sir john willard . a fury of superstition arose at once . as far as i could see , nobody could derive any particular profit from sir john ’ s death . mr. bleibner was a different case . he was a man of great wealth . the information i received from new york contained several suggestive points . to begin with , young bleibner was reported to have said he had a good friend in egypt from whom he could borrow . it was tacitly understood that he meant his uncle , but it seemed to me that in that case he would have said so outright . the words suggest some boon companion of his own . another thing , he scraped up enough money to take him to egypt , his uncle refused outright to advance him a penny , yet he was able to pay the return passage to new york . some one must have lent him the money . ”
christie	poirot	“ all that was very thin , ” i objected . “ but there was more . hastings , there occur often enough words spoken metaphorically which are taken literally . the opposite can happen too . in this case , words which were meant literally were taken metaphorically . young bleibner wrote plainly enough : ‘ i am a leper , ’ but nobody realized that he shot himself because he believed that he had contracted the dread disease of leprosy . ”
christie	poirot	“ what ? ” i ejaculated . “ it was the clever invention of a diabolical mind . young bleibner was suffering from some minor skin trouble , he had lived in the south sea islands , where the disease is common enough . ames was a former friend of his , and a well-known medical man , he would never dream of doubting his word . when i arrived here , my suspicions were divided between harper and dr. ames , but i soon realized that only the doctor could have perpetrated and concealed the crimes , and i learnt from harper that he was previously acquainted with young bleibner . doubtless the latter at some time or another had made a will or had insured his life in favour of the doctor . the latter saw his chance of acquiring wealth . it was easy for him to inoculate mr. bleibner with the deadly germs . then the nephew , overcome with despair at the dread news his friend had conveyed to him , shot himself . mr. bleibner , whatever his intentions , had made no will . his fortune would pass to his nephew and from him to the doctor . ”
christie	poirot	“ and mr. schneider ? ” “ we can not be sure . he knew young bleibner too , remember , and may have suspected something , or , again , the doctor may have thought that a further death motiveless and purposeless would strengthen the coils of superstition . furthermore , i will tell you an interesting psychological fact , hastings . a murderer has always a strong desire to repeat his successful crime , the performance of it grows upon him . hence my fears for young willard . the figure of anubis you saw to-night was hassan , dressed up by my orders . i wanted to see if i could frighten the doctor . but it would take more than the supernatural to frighten him . i could see that he was not entirely taken in by my pretences of belief in the occult . the little comedy i played for him did not deceive him . i suspected that he would endeavour to make me the next victim . ah , but in spite of _la mer maudite_ , the heat abominable , and the annoyances of the sand , the little grey cells still functioned ! ”
christie	poirot	poirot proved to be perfectly right in his premises . young bleibner , some years ago , in a fit of drunken merriment , had made a jocular will , leaving “ my cigarette case you admire so much and everything else of which i die possessed which will be principally debts to my good friend robert ames who once saved my life from drowning . ”
christie	poirot	the case was hushed up as far as possible , and , to this day , people talk of the remarkable series of deaths in connection with the tomb of men-her-ra as a triumphal proof of the vengeance of a bygone king upon the desecrators of his tomb—a belief which , as poirot pointed out to me , is contrary to all egyptian belief and thought .
christie	poirot	vii the jewel robbery at the _grand metropolitan_ “ poirot , ” i said , “ a change of air would do you good. ” “ you think so , _mon ami_ ? ” “ i am sure of it. ” “ eh—eh ? ” said my friend , smiling . “ it is all arranged , then ? ”
christie	poirot	“ you will come ? ” “ where do you propose to take me ? ” “ brighton . as a matter of fact , a friend of mine in the city put me on to a very good thing , and—well , i have money to burn , as the saying goes . i think a week-end at the _grand metropolitan_ would do us all the good in the world . ”
christie	poirot	“ thank you , i accept most gratefully . you have the good heart to think of an old man . and the good heart , it is in the end worth all the little grey cells . yes , yes , i who speak to you am in danger of forgetting that sometimes . ”
christie	poirot	i did not quite relish the implication . i fancy that poirot is sometimes a little inclined to underestimate my mental capacities . but his pleasure was so evident that i put my slight annoyance aside .
christie	poirot	“ then , that ’ s all right , ” i said hastily . saturday evening saw us dining at the _grand metropolitan_ in the midst of a gay throng . all the world and his wife seemed to be at brighton . the dresses were marvellous , and the jewels—worn sometimes with more love of display than good taste—were something magnificent .
christie	poirot	“ _hein_ , it is a sight this ! ” murmured poirot . “ this is the home of the profiteer , is it not so , hastings ? ” “ supposed to be , ” i replied . “ but we ’ ll hope they aren ’ t all tarred with the profiteering brush . ”
christie	poirot	poirot gazed round him placidly . “ the sight of so many jewels makes me wish i had turned my brains to crime , instead of to its detection . what a magnificent opportunity for some thief of distinction ! regard , hastings , that stout woman by the pillar . she is , as you would say , plastered with gems . ”
christie	poirot	i followed his eyes . “ why , ” i exclaimed , “ it ’ s mrs. opalsen. ” “ you know her ? ” “ slightly . her husband is a rich stockbroker who made a fortune in the recent oil boom. ” after dinner we ran across the opalsens in the lounge , and i introduced poirot to them . we chatted for a few minutes , and ended by having our coffee together .
christie	poirot	poirot said a few words in praise of some of the costlier gems displayed on the lady ’ s ample bosom , and she brightened up at once . “ it ’ s a perfect hobby of mine , mr. poirot . i just _love_ jewellery . ed knows my weakness , and every time things go well he brings me something new . you are interested in precious stones ? ”
christie	poirot	“ i have had a good deal to do with them one time and another , madame . my profession has brought me into contact with some of the most famous jewels in the world . ”
christie	poirot	he went on to narrate , with discreet pseudonyms , the story of the historic jewels of a reigning house , and mrs. opalsen listened with bated breath . “ there now ! ” she exclaimed , as he ended . “ if it isn ’ t just like a play ! you know , i ’ ve got some pearls of my own that have a history attached to them . i believe it ’ s supposed to be one of the finest necklaces in the world—the pearls are so beautifully matched and so perfect in colour . i declare i really must run up and get it ! ”
christie	poirot	“ oh , madame , ” protested poirot , “ you are too amiable . pray do not derange yourself ! ” “ oh , but i ’ d like to show it to you. ” the buxom dame waddled across to the lift briskly enough . her husband , who had been talking to me , looked at poirot inquiringly .
christie	poirot	“ madame your wife is so amiable as to insist on showing me her pearl necklace , ” explained the latter . “ oh , the pearls ! ” opalsen smiled in a satisfied fashion . “ well , they _are_ worth seeing . cost a pretty penny too ! still , the money ’ s there all right ; i could get what i paid for them any day—perhaps more . may have to , too , if things go on as they are now . money ’ s confoundedly tight in the city . all this infernal e.p.d. ” he rambled on , launching into technicalities where i could not follow him .
christie	poirot	he was interrupted by a small page-boy who approached and murmured something in his ear . “ eh—what ? i ’ ll come at once . not taken ill , is she ? excuse me , gentlemen. ” he left us abruptly . poirot leaned back and lit one of his tiny russian cigarettes . then , carefully and meticulously , he arranged the empty coffee-cups in a neat row , and beamed happily on the result .
christie	poirot	the minutes passed . the opalsens did not return . “ curious , ” i remarked , at length . “ i wonder when they will come back. ” poirot watched the ascending spirals of smoke , and then said thoughtfully :
christie	poirot	“ they will not come back. ” “ why ? ” “ because , my friend , something has happened. ” “ what sort of thing ? how do you know ? ” i asked curiously . poirot smiled . “ a few moments ago the manager came hurriedly out of his office and ran upstairs . he was much agitated . the lift-boy is deep in talk with one of the pages . the lift-bell has rung three times , but he heeds it not . thirdly , even the waiters are _distrait_ ; and to make a waiter _distrait_—— ” poirot shook his head with an air of finality . “ the affair must indeed be of the first magnitude . ah , it is as i thought ! here come the police . ”
christie	poirot	two men had just entered the hotel—one in uniform , the other in plain clothes . they spoke to a page , and were immediately ushered upstairs . a few minutes later , the same boy descended and came up to where we were sitting .
christie	poirot	“ mr . opalsen ’ s compliments , and would you step upstairs. ” poirot sprang nimbly to his feet . one would have said that he awaited the summons . i followed with no less alacrity . the opalsens ’ apartments were situated on the first floor . after knocking on the door , the page-boy retired , and we answered the summons , “ come in ! ” a strange scene met our eyes . the room was mrs. opalsen ’ s bedroom , and in the centre of it , lying back in an arm-chair , was the lady herself , weeping violently . she presented an extraordinary spectacle , with the tears making great furrows in the powder with which her complexion was liberally coated . mr. opalsen was striding up and down angrily . the two police officials stood in the middle of the room , one with a notebook in hand . an hotel chambermaid , looking frightened to death , stood by the fire-place ; and on the other side of the room a frenchwoman , obviously mrs. opalsen ’ s maid , was weeping and wringing her hands , with an intensity of grief that rivalled that of her mistress .
christie	poirot	into this pandemonium stepped poirot , neat and smiling . immediately , with an energy surprising in one of her bulk , mrs. opalsen sprang from her chair towards him . “ there now ; ed may say what he likes , but i believe in luck , i do . it was fated i should meet you the way i did this evening , and i ’ ve a feeling that if you can ’ t get my pearls back for me nobody can . ”
christie	poirot	“ calm yourself , i pray of you , madame. ” poirot patted her hand soothingly . “ reassure yourself . all will be well . hercule poirot will aid you ! ” mr. opalsen turned to the police inspector .
christie	poirot	“ there will be no objection to my—er—calling in this gentleman , i suppose ? ” “ none at all , sir , ” replied the man civilly , but with complete indifference . “ perhaps now your lady ’ s feeling better she ’ ll just let us have the facts ? ”
christie	poirot	mrs. opalsen looked helplessly at poirot . he led her back to her chair . “ seat yourself , madame , and recount to us the whole history without agitating yourself. ” thus abjured , mrs. opalsen dried her eyes gingerly , and began .
christie	poirot	“ i came upstairs after dinner to fetch my pearls for mr. poirot here to see . the chambermaid and célestine were both in the room as usual—— ” “ excuse me , madame , but what do you mean by ‘ as usual ’ ? ”
christie	poirot	mr. opalsen explained . “ i make it a rule that no one is to come into this room unless célestine , the maid , is there also . the chambermaid does the room in the morning while célestine is present , and comes in after dinner to turn down the beds under the same conditions ; otherwise she never enters the room . ”
christie	poirot	“ well , as i was saying , ” continued mrs. opalsen , “ i came up . i went to the drawer here , ” —she indicated the bottom right-hand drawer of the knee-hole dressing-table— “ took out my jewel-case and unlocked it . it seemed quite as usual—but the pearls were not there ! ”
christie	poirot	the inspector had been busy with his notebook . “ when had you last seen them ? ” he asked . “ they were there when i went down to dinner. ” “ you are sure ? ” “ quite sure . i was uncertain whether to wear them or not , but in the end i decided on the emeralds , and put them back in the jewel-case . ”
christie	poirot	“ who locked up the jewel-case ? ” “ i did . i wear the key on a chain round my neck. ” she held it up as she spoke . the inspector examined it , and shrugged his shoulders .
christie	poirot	“ the thief must have had a duplicate key . no difficult matter . the lock is quite a simple one . what did you do after you ’ d locked the jewel-case ? ” “ i put it back in the bottom drawer where i always keep it . ”
christie	poirot	“ you didn ’ t lock the drawer ? ” “ no , i never do . my maid remains in the room till i come up , so there ’ s no need. ” the inspector ’ s face grew graver . “ am i to understand that the jewels were there when you went down to dinner , and that since then _the maid has not left the room_ ? ”
christie	poirot	suddenly , as though the horror of her own situation for the first time burst upon her , célestine uttered a piercing shriek , and , flinging herself upon poirot , poured out a torrent of incoherent french .
christie	poirot	the suggestion was infamous ! that she should be suspected of robbing madame ! the police were well known to be of a stupidity incredible ! but monsieur , who was a frenchman— “ a belgian , ” interjected poirot , but célestine paid no attention to the correction .
christie	poirot	monsieur would not stand by and see her falsely accused , while that infamous chambermaid was allowed to go scot-free . she had never liked her—a bold , red-faced thing—a born thief . she had said from the first that she was not honest . and had kept a sharp watch over her too , when she was doing madame ’ s room ! let those idiots of policemen search her , and if they did not find madame ’ s pearls on her it would be very surprising !
christie	poirot	although this harangue was uttered in rapid and virulent french , célestine had interlarded it with a wealth of gesture , and the chambermaid realized at least a part of her meaning . she reddened angrily .
christie	poirot	“ if that foreign woman ’ s saying i took the pearls , it ’ s a lie ! ” she declared heatedly . “ i never so much as saw them. ” “ search her ! ” screamed the other . “ you will find it is as i say . ”
christie	poirot	“ you ’ re a liar—do you hear ? ” said the chambermaid , advancing upon her . “ stole ’ em yourself , and want to put it on me . why , i was only in the room about three minutes before the lady come up , and then you were sitting here the whole time , as you always do , like a cat watching a mouse . ”
christie	poirot	the inspector looked across inquiringly at célestine . “ is that true ? didn ’ t you leave the room at all ? ” “ i did not actually leave her alone , ” admitted célestine reluctantly , “ but i went into my own room through the door here twice—once to fetch a reel of cotton , and once for my scissors . she must have done it then . ”
christie	poirot	“ you wasn ’ t gone a minute , ” retorted the chambermaid angrily . “ just popped out and in again . i ’ d be glad if the police _would_ search me . _i ’ ve nothing to be afraid of_ . ”
christie	poirot	at this moment there was a tap at the door . the inspector went to it . his face brightened when he saw who it was . “ ah ! ” he said . “ that ’ s rather fortunate . i sent for one of our female searchers , and she ’ s just arrived . perhaps if you wouldn ’ t mind going into the room next door . ”
christie	poirot	he looked at the chambermaid , who stepped across the threshold with a toss of her head , the searcher following her closely . the french girl had sunk sobbing into a chair . poirot was looking round the room , the main features of which i have made clear by a sketch .
christie	poirot	[ a sketch of the bedroom , adjoining maid 's room , and corridor . ] “ where does that door lead ? ” he inquired , nodding his head towards the one by the window . “ into the next apartment , i believe , ” said the inspector . “ it ’ s bolted , anyway , on this side . ”
christie	poirot	poirot walked across to it , tried it , then drew back the bolt and tried it again . “ and on the other side as well , ” he remarked . “ well , that seems to rule out that . ”
christie	poirot	he walked over to the windows , examining each of them in turn . “ and again—nothing . not even a balcony outside. ” “ even if there were , ” said the inspector impatiently , “ i don ’ t see how that would help us , if the maid never left the room . ”
christie	poirot	“ _évidemment_ , ” said poirot , not disconcerted . “ as mademoiselle is positive she did not leave the room—— ” he was interrupted by the reappearance of the chambermaid and the police searcher . “ nothing , ” said the latter laconically .
christie	poirot	“ i should hope not , indeed , ” said the chambermaid virtuously . “ and that french hussy ought to be ashamed of herself taking away an honest girl ’ s character ! ” “ there , there , my girl ; that ’ s all right , ” said the inspector , opening the door . “ nobody suspects you . you go along and get on with your work . ”
christie	poirot	the chambermaid went unwillingly . “ going to search _her_ ? ” she demanded , pointing at célestine . “ yes , yes ! ” he shut the door on her and turned the key . célestine accompanied the searcher into the small room in her turn . a few minutes later she also returned . nothing had been found on her .
christie	poirot	the inspector ’ s face grew graver . “ i ’ m afraid i ’ ll have to ask you to come along with me all the same , miss. ” he turned to mrs. opalsen . “ i ’ m sorry , madam , but all the evidence points that way . if she ’ s not got them on her , they ’ re hidden somewhere about the room . ”
christie	poirot	célestine uttered a piercing shriek , and clung to poirot ’ s arm . the latter bent and whispered something in the girl ’ s ear . she looked up at him doubtfully . “ _si , si , mon enfant_—i assure you it is better not to resist. ” then he turned to the inspector . “ you permit , monsieur ? a little experiment—purely for my own satisfaction . ”
christie	poirot	“ depends on what it is , ” replied the police officer non-committally . poirot addressed célestine once more . “ you have told us that you went into your room to fetch a reel of cotton . whereabouts was it ? ”
christie	poirot	“ on the top of the chest of drawers , monsieur. ” “ and the scissors ? ” “ they also. ” “ would it be troubling you too much , mademoiselle , to ask you to repeat those two actions ? you were sitting here with your work , you say ? ”
christie	poirot	célestine sat down , and then , at a sign from poirot , rose , passed into the adjoining room , took up an object from the chest of drawers , and returned . poirot divided his attention between her movements and a large turnip of a watch which he held in the palm of his hand .
christie	poirot	“ again , if you please , mademoiselle. ” at the conclusion of the second performance , he made a note in his pocket-book , and returned the watch to his pocket . “ thank you , mademoiselle . and you , monsieur , ” —he bowed to the inspector— “ for your courtesy . ”
christie	poirot	the inspector seemed somewhat entertained by this excessive politeness . célestine departed in a flood of tears , accompanied by the woman and the plain-clothes official . then , with a brief apology to mrs. opalsen , the inspector set to work to ransack the room . he pulled out drawers , opened cupboards , completely unmade the bed , and tapped the floor . mr. opalsen looked on sceptically .
christie	poirot	“ you really think you will find them ? ” “ yes , sir . it stands to reason . she hadn ’ t time to take them out of the room . the lady ’ s discovering the robbery so soon upset her plans . no , they ’ re here right enough . one of the two must have hidden them—and it ’ s very unlikely for the chambermaid to have done so . ”
christie	poirot	“ more than unlikely—impossible ! ” said poirot quietly . “ eh ? ” the inspector stared . poirot smiled modestly . “ i will demonstrate . hastings , my good friend , take my watch in your hand—with care . it is a family heirloom ! just now i timed mademoiselle ’ s movements—her first absence from the room was of twelve seconds , her second of fifteen . now observe my actions . madame will have the kindness to give me the key of the jewel-case . i thank you . my friend hastings will have the kindness to say ‘ go ! ’ ”
christie	poirot	“ go ! ” i said . with almost incredible swiftness , poirot wrenched open the drawer of the dressing-table , extracted the jewel-case , fitted the key in the lock , opened the case , selected a piece of jewellery , shut and locked the case , and returned it to the drawer , which he pushed to again . his movements were like lightning .
christie	poirot	“ well , _mon ami_ ? ” he demanded of me breathlessly . “ forty-six seconds , ” i replied . “ you see ? ” he looked round . “ there would not have been time for the chambermaid even to take the necklace out , far less hide it . ”
christie	poirot	“ then that settles it on the maid , ” said the inspector with satisfaction , and returned to his search . he passed into the maid ’ s bedroom next door . poirot was frowning thoughtfully . suddenly he shot a question at mr. opalsen .
christie	poirot	“ this necklace—it was , without doubt , insured ? ” mr. opalsen looked a trifle surprised at the question . “ yes , ” he said hesitatingly , “ that is so. ” “ but what does that matter ? ” broke in mrs. opalsen tearfully . “ it ’ s my necklace i want . it was unique . no money could be the same . ”
christie	poirot	“ i comprehend , madame , ” said poirot soothingly . “ i comprehend perfectly . to _la femme_ sentiment is everything—is it not so ? but monsieur , who has not the so fine susceptibility , will doubtless find some slight consolation in the fact . ”
christie	poirot	“ of course , of course , ” said mr. opalsen rather uncertainly . “ still—— ” he was interrupted by a shout of triumph from the inspector . he came in dangling something from his fingers . with a cry , mrs. opalsen heaved herself up from her chair . she was a changed woman .
christie	poirot	“ oh , oh , my necklace ! ” she clasped it to her breast with both hands . we crowded round . “ where was it ? ” demanded opalsen . “ maid ’ s bed . in among the springs of the wire mattress . she must have stolen it and hidden it there before the chambermaid arrived on the scene . ”
christie	poirot	“ you permit , madame ? ” said poirot gently . he took the necklace from her and examined it closely ; then handed it back with a bow . “ i ’ m afraid , madam , you ’ ll have to hand it over to us for the time being , ” said the inspector . “ we shall want it for the charge . but it shall be returned to you as soon as possible . ”
christie	poirot	mr. opalsen frowned . “ is that necessary ? ” “ i ’ m afraid so , sir . just a formality. ” “ oh , let him take it , ed ! ” cried his wife . “ i ’ d feel safer if he did . i shouldn ’ t sleep a wink thinking some one else might try and get hold of it . that wretched girl ! and i would never have believed it of her . ”
christie	poirot	“ there , there , my dear , don ’ t take on so. ” i felt a gentle pressure on my arm . it was poirot . “ shall we slip away , my friend ? i think our services are no longer needed . ”
christie	poirot	once outside , however , he hesitated , and then , much to my surprise , he remarked : “ i should rather like to see the room next door. ” the door was not locked , and we entered . the room , which was a large double one , was unoccupied . dust lay about rather noticeably , and my sensitive friend gave a characteristic grimace as he ran his finger round a rectangular mark on a table near the window .
christie	poirot	“ the _service_ leaves to be desired , ” he observed dryly . he was staring thoughtfully out of the window , and seemed to have fallen into a brown study . “ well ? ” i demanded impatiently . “ what did we come in here for ? ”
christie	poirot	he started . “ _je vous demande pardon , mon ami_ . i wished to see if the door was really bolted on this side also. ” “ well , ” i said , glancing at the door which communicated with the room we had just left , “ it _is_ bolted . ”
christie	poirot	poirot nodded . he still seemed to be thinking . “ and , anyway , ” i continued , “ what does it matter ? the case is over . i wish you ’ d had more chance of distinguishing yourself . but it was the kind of case that even a stiff-backed idiot like that inspector couldn ’ t go wrong over . ”
christie	poirot	poirot shook his head . “ the case is not over , my friend . it will not be over until we find out who stole the pearls. ” “ but the maid did ! ” “ why do you say that ? ”
christie	poirot	“ why , ” i stammered , “ they were found—actually in her mattress. ” “ ta , ta , ta ! ” said poirot impatiently . “ those were not the pearls. ” “ what ? ” “ imitation , _mon ami_. ” the statement took my breath away . poirot was smiling placidly .
christie	poirot	“ the good inspector obviously knows nothing of jewels . but presently there will be a fine hullabaloo ! ” “ come ! ” i cried , dragging at his arm . “ where ? ” “ we must tell the opalsens at once . ”
christie	poirot	“ i think not. ” “ but that poor woman—— ” “ _eh bien_ ; that poor woman , as you call her , will have a much better night believing the jewels to be safe. ” “ but the thief may escape with them ! ”
christie	poirot	“ as usual , my friend , you speak without reflection . how do you know that the pearls mrs. opalsen locked up so carefully to-night were not the false ones , and that the real robbery did not take place at a much earlier date ? ”
christie	poirot	“ oh ! ” i said , bewildered . “ exactly , ” said poirot , beaming . “ we start again. ” he led the way out of the room , paused a moment as though considering , and then walked down to the end of the corridor , stopping outside the small den where the chambermaids and valets of the respective floors congregated . our particular chambermaid appeared to be holding a small court there , and to be retailing her late experiences to an appreciative audience . she stopped in the middle of a sentence . poirot bowed with his usual politeness .
christie	poirot	“ excuse that i derange you , but i shall be obliged if you will unlock for me the door of mr. opalsen ’ s room. ” the woman rose willingly , and we accompanied her down the passage again . mr. opalsen ’ s room was on the other side of the corridor , its door facing that of his wife ’ s room . the chambermaid unlocked it with her pass-key , and we entered .
christie	poirot	as she was about to depart poirot detained her . “ one moment ; have you ever seen among the effects of mr. opalsen a card like this ? ” he held out a plain white card , rather highly glazed and uncommon in appearance . the maid took it and scrutinized it carefully .
christie	poirot	“ no , sir , i can ’ t say i have . but , anyway , the valet has most to do with the gentlemen ’ s rooms. ” “ i see . thank you. ” poirot took back the card . the woman departed . poirot appeared to reflect a little . then he gave a short , sharp nod of the head .
christie	poirot	“ ring the bell , i pray of you , hastings . three times , for the valet. ” i obeyed , devoured with curiosity . meanwhile poirot had emptied the waste-paper-basket on the floor , and was swiftly going through its contents .
christie	poirot	in a few moments the valet answered the bell . to him poirot put the same question , and handed him the card to examine . but the response was the same . the valet had never seen a card of that particular quality among mr. opalsen ’ s belongings . poirot thanked him , and he withdrew , somewhat unwillingly , with an inquisitive glance at the overturned waste-paper-basket and the litter on the floor . he could hardly have helped overhearing poirot ’ s thoughtful remark as he bundled the torn papers back again :
christie	poirot	“ and the necklace was heavily insured . . . . ” “ poirot , ” i cried , “ i see—— ” “ you see nothing , my friend , ” he replied quickly . “ as usual , nothing at all ! it is incredible—but there it is . let us return to our own apartments . ”
christie	poirot	we did so in silence . once there , to my intense surprise , poirot effected a rapid change of clothing . “ i go to london to-night , ” he explained . “ it is imperative. ” “ what ? ” “ absolutely . the real work , that of the brain ( ah , those brave little grey cells ) , it is done . i go to seek the confirmation . i shall find it ! impossible to deceive hercule poirot ! ”
christie	poirot	“ you ’ ll come a cropper one of these days , ” i observed , rather disgusted by his vanity . “ do not be enraged , i beg of you , _mon ami_ . i count on you to do me a service—of your friendship . ”
christie	poirot	“ of course , ” i said eagerly , rather ashamed of my moroseness . “ what is it ? ” “ the sleeve of my coat that i have taken off—will you brush it ? see you , a little white powder has clung to it . you without doubt observed me run my finger round the drawer of the dressing-table ? ”
christie	poirot	“ no , i didn ’ t. ” “ you should observe my actions , my friend . thus i obtained the powder on my finger , and , being a little over-excited , i rubbed it on my sleeve ; an action without method which i deplore—false to all my principles . ”
christie	poirot	“ but what was the powder ? ” i asked , not particularly interested in poirot ’ s principles . “ not the poison of the borgias , ” replied poirot , with a twinkle . “ i see your imagination mounting . i should say it was french chalk . ”
christie	poirot	“ french chalk ? ” “ yes , cabinet-makers use it to make drawers run smoothly. ” i laughed . “ you old sinner ! i thought you were working up to something exciting. ” “ au revoir , my friend . i save myself . i fly ! ”
christie	poirot	the door shut behind him . with a smile , half of derision , half of affection , i picked up the coat , and stretched out my hand for the clothes-brush . • • • • • • •
christie	poirot	the next morning , hearing nothing from poirot , i went out for a stroll , met some old friends , and lunched with them at their hotel . in the afternoon we went for a spin . a punctured tyre delayed us , and it was past eight when i got back to the _grand metropolitan_ .
christie	poirot	the first sight that met my eyes was poirot , looking even more diminutive than usual , sandwiched between the opalsens , beaming in a state of placid satisfaction . “ _mon ami_ hastings ! ” he cried , and sprang to meet me . “ embrace me , my friend ; all has marched to a marvel ! ”
christie	poirot	luckily , the embrace was merely figurative—not a thing one is always sure of with poirot . “ do you mean—— ” i began . “ just wonderful , i call it ! ” said mrs. opalsen , smiling all over her fat face . “ didn ’ t i tell you , ed , that if he couldn ’ t get back my pearls nobody would ? ”
christie	poirot	“ you did , my dear , you did . and you were right. ” i looked helplessly at poirot , and he answered the glance . “ my friend hastings is , as you say in england , all at the seaside . seat yourself , and i will recount to you all the affair that has so happily ended . ”
christie	poirot	“ ended ? ” “ but yes . they are arrested. ” “ who are arrested ? ” “ the chambermaid and the valet , _parbleu_ ! you did not suspect ? not with my parting hint about the french chalk ? ” “ you said cabinet-makers used it . ”
christie	poirot	“ certainly they do—to make drawers slide easily . somebody wanted that drawer to slide in and out without any noise . who could that be ? obviously , only the chambermaid . the plan was so ingenious that it did not at once leap to the eye—not even to the eye of hercule poirot .
christie	poirot	“ listen , this was how it was done . the valet was in the empty room next door , waiting . the french maid leaves the room . quick as a flash the chambermaid whips open the drawer , takes out the jewel-case , and , slipping back the bolt , passes it through the door . the valet opens it at his leisure with the duplicate key with which he has provided himself , extracts the necklace , and waits his time . célestine leaves the room again , and—pst ! —in a flash the case is passed back again and replaced in the drawer .
christie	poirot	“ madame arrives , the theft is discovered . the chambermaid demands to be searched , with a good deal of righteous indignation , and leaves the room without a stain on her character . the imitation necklace with which they have provided themselves has been concealed in the french girl ’ s bed that morning by the chambermaid—a master stroke , _ça ! _ ”
christie	poirot	“ but what did you go to london for ? ” “ you remember the card ? ” “ certainly . it puzzled me—and puzzles me still . i thought—— ” i hesitated delicately , glancing at mr. opalsen . poirot laughed heartily .
christie	poirot	“ _une blague ! _ for the benefit of the valet . the card was one with a specially prepared surface—for finger-prints . i went straight to scotland yard , asked for our old friend inspector japp , and laid the facts before him . as i had suspected , the finger-prints proved to be those of two well-known jewel thieves who have been ‘ wanted ’ for some time . japp came down with me , the thieves were arrested , and the necklace was discovered in the valet ’ s possession . a clever pair , but they failed in _method_ . have i not told you , hastings , at least thirty-six times , that without method—— ”
christie	poirot	“ at least thirty-six thousand times ! ” i interrupted . “ but where did their ‘ method ’ break down ? ” “ _mon ami_ , it is a good plan to take a place as chambermaid or valet—but you must not shirk your work . they left an empty room undusted ; and therefore , when the man put down the jewel-case on the little table near the communicating door , it left a square mark—— ”
christie	poirot	“ i remember , ” i cried . “ before , i was undecided . then—i _knew_ ! ” there was a moment ’ s silence . “ and i ’ ve got my pearls , ” said mrs. opalsen as a sort of greek chorus . “ well , ” i said , “ i ’ d better have some dinner. ” poirot accompanied me .
christie	poirot	“ this ought to mean kudos for you , ” i observed . “ _pas du tout_ , ” replied poirot tranquilly . “ japp and the local inspector will divide the credit between them . but ” —he tapped his pocket— “ i have a cheque here , from mr. opalsen , and , how say you , my friend ? this week-end has not gone according to plan . shall we return here next week-end—at my expense this time ? ”
christie	poirot	viii the kidnapped prime minister now that war and the problems of war are things of the past , i think i may safely venture to reveal to the world the part which my friend poirot played in a moment of national crisis . the secret has been well guarded . not a whisper of it reached the press . but , now that the need for secrecy has gone by , i feel it is only just that england should know the debt it owes to my quaint little friend , whose marvellous brain so ably averted a great catastrophe .
christie	poirot	one evening after dinner—i will not particularize the date ; it suffices to say that it was at the time when “ peace by negotiation ” was the parrot-cry of england ’ s enemies—my friend and i were sitting in his rooms . after being invalided out of the army i had been given a recruiting job , and it had become my custom to drop in on poirot in the evenings after dinner and talk with him of any cases of interest that he might have on hand .
christie	poirot	i was attempting to discuss with him the sensational news of that day—no less than an attempted assassination of mr. david macadam , england ’ s prime minister . the account in the papers had evidently been carefully censored . no details were given , save that the prime minister had had a marvellous escape , the bullet just grazing his cheek .
christie	poirot	i considered that our police must have been shamefully careless for such an outrage to be possible . i could well understand that the german agents in england would be willing to risk much for such an achievement . “ fighting mac , ” as his own party had nicknamed him , had strenuously and unequivocally combated the pacifist influence which was becoming so prevalent .
christie	poirot	he was more than england ’ s prime minister—he _was_ england ; and to have removed him from his sphere of influence would have been a crushing and paralysing blow to britain . poirot was busy mopping a grey suit with a minute sponge . never was there a dandy such as hercule poirot . neatness and order were his passion . now , with the odour of benzine filling the air , he was quite unable to give me his full attention .
christie	poirot	“ in a little minute i am with you , my friend . i have all but finished . the spot of grease—he is not good—i remove him—so ! ” he waved his sponge . i smiled as i lit another cigarette .
christie	poirot	“ anything interesting on ? ” i inquired , after a minute or two . “ i assist a—how do you call it ? — ‘ charlady ’ to find her husband . a difficult affair , needing the tact . for i have a little idea that when he is found he will not be pleased . what would you ? for my part , i sympathize with him . he was a man of discrimination to lose himself . ”
christie	poirot	i laughed . “ at last ! the spot of grease , he is gone ! i am at your disposal. ” “ i was asking you what you thought of this attempt to assassinate macadam ? ” “ _enfantillage ! _ ” replied poirot promptly . “ one can hardly take it seriously . to fire with the rifle—never does it succeed . it is a device of the past . ”
christie	poirot	“ it was very near succeeding this time , ” i reminded him . poirot shook his head impatiently . he was about to reply when the landlady thrust her head round the door and informed him that there were two gentlemen below who wanted to see him .
christie	poirot	“ they won ’ t give their names , sir , but they says as it ’ s very important. ” “ let them mount , ” said poirot , carefully folding his grey trousers . in a few minutes the two visitors were ushered in , and my heart gave a leap as in the foremost i recognized no less a personage than lord estair , leader of the house of commons ; whilst his companion , mr. bernard dodge , was also a member of the war cabinet , and , as i knew , a close personal friend of the prime minister .
christie	poirot	“ monsieur poirot ? ” said lord estair interrogatively . my friend bowed . the great man looked at me and hesitated . “ my business is private. ” “ you may speak freely before captain hastings , ” said my friend , nodding to me to remain . “ he has not all the gifts , no ! but i answer for his discretion . ”
christie	poirot	lord estair still hesitated , but mr . dodge broke in abruptly : “ oh , come on—don ’ t let ’ s beat about the bush ! as far as i can see , the whole of england will know the hole we ’ re in soon enough . time ’ s everything . ”
christie	poirot	“ pray be seated , messieurs , ” said poirot politely . “ will you take the big chair , _milord_ ? ” lord estair started slightly . “ you know me ? ” poirot smiled . “ certainly . i read the little papers with the pictures . how should i not know you ? ”
christie	poirot	“ monsieur poirot , i have come to consult you upon a matter of the most vital urgency . i must ask for absolute secrecy. ” “ you have the word of hercule poirot—i can say no more ! ” said my friend grandiloquently .
christie	poirot	“ it concerns the prime minister . we are in grave trouble. ” “ we ’ re up a tree ! ” interposed mr . dodge . “ the injury is serious , then ? ” i asked . “ what injury ? ” “ the bullet wound. ” “ oh , that ! ” cried mr . dodge contemptuously . “ that ’ s old history . ”
christie	poirot	“ as my colleague says , ” continued lord estair , “ that affair is over and done with . luckily , it failed . i wished i could say as much for the second attempt. ” “ there has been a second attempt , then ? ”
christie	poirot	“ yes , though not of the same nature . monsieur poirot , the prime minister has disappeared. ” “ what ? ” “ he has been kidnapped ! ” “ impossible ! ” i cried , stupefied . poirot threw a withering glance at me , which i knew enjoined me to keep my mouth shut .
christie	poirot	“ unfortunately , impossible as it seems , it is only too true , ” continued his lordship . poirot looked at mr . dodge . “ you said just now , monsieur , that time was everything . what did you mean by that ? ”
christie	poirot	the two men exchanged glances , and then lord estair said : “ you have heard , monsieur poirot , of the approaching allied conference ? ” my friend nodded . “ for obvious reasons , no details have been given of when and where it is to take place . but , although it has been kept out of the newspapers , the date is , of course , widely known in diplomatic circles . the conference is to be held to-morrow—thursday—evening at versailles . now you perceive the terrible gravity of the situation . i will not conceal from you that the prime minister ’ s presence at the conference is a vital necessity . the pacifist propaganda , started and maintained by the german agents in our midst , has been very active . it is the universal opinion that the turning point of the conference will be the strong personality of the prime minister . his absence may have the most serious results—possibly a premature and disastrous peace . and we have no one who can be sent in his place . he alone can represent england . ”
christie	poirot	poirot ’ s face had grown very grave . “ then you regard the kidnapping of the prime minister as a direct attempt to prevent his being present at the conference ? ” “ most certainly i do . he was actually on his way to france at the time . ”
christie	poirot	“ and the conference is to be held ? ” “ at nine o ’ clock to-morrow night. ” poirot drew an enormous watch from his pocket . “ it is now a quarter to nine. ” “ twenty-four hours , ” said mr . dodge thoughtfully .
christie	poirot	“ and a quarter , ” amended poirot . “ do not forget the quarter , monsieur—it may come in useful . now for the details—the abduction , did it take place in england or in france ? ” “ in france . mr. macadam crossed to france this morning . he was to stay to-night as the guest of the commander-in-chief , proceeding to-morrow to paris . he was conveyed across the channel by destroyer . at boulogne he was met by a car from general headquarters and one of the commander-in-chief ’ s a.d.c.s . ”
christie	poirot	“ _eh bien_ ? ” “ well , they started from boulogne—but they never arrived. ” “ what ? ” “ monsieur poirot , it was a bogus car and a bogus a.d.c . the real car was found in a side road , with the chauffeur and the a.d.c . neatly gagged and bound . ”
christie	poirot	“ and the bogus car ? ” “ is still at large. ” poirot made a gesture of impatience . “ incredible ! surely it can not escape attention for long ? ” “ so we thought . it seemed merely a question of searching thoroughly . that part of france is under military law . we were convinced that the car could not go long unnoticed . the french police and our own scotland yard men , and the military are straining every nerve . it is , as you say , incredible—but nothing has been discovered ! ”
christie	poirot	at that moment a tap came at the door , and a young officer entered with a heavily sealed envelope which he handed to lord estair . “ just through from france , sir . i brought it on here , as you directed . ”
christie	poirot	the minister tore it open eagerly , and uttered an exclamation . the officer withdrew . “ here is news at last ! this telegram has just been decoded . they have found the second car , also the secretary , daniels , chloroformed , gagged , and bound , in an abandoned farm near c—— . he remembers nothing , except something being pressed against his mouth and nose from behind , and struggling to free himself . the police are satisfied as to the genuineness of his statement . ”
christie	poirot	“ and they have found nothing else ? ” “ no. ” “ not the prime minister ’ s dead body ? then , there is hope . but it is strange . why , after trying to shoot him this morning , are they now taking so much trouble to keep him alive ? ”
christie	poirot	dodge shook his head . “ one thing ’ s quite certain . they ’ re determined at all costs to prevent his attending the conference. ” “ if it is humanly possible , the prime minister shall be there . god grant it is not too late . now , messieurs , recount to me everything—from the beginning . i must know about this shooting affair as well . ”
christie	poirot	“ last night , the prime minister , accompanied by one of his secretaries , captain daniels—— ” “ the same who accompanied him to france ? ” “ yes . as i was saying , they motored down to windsor , where the prime minister was granted an audience . early this morning , he returned to town , and it was on the way that the attempted assassination took place . ”
christie	poirot	“ one moment , if you please . who is this captain daniels ? you have his dossier ? ” lord estair smiled . “ i thought you would ask me that . we do not know very much of him . he is of no particular family . he has served in the english army , and is an extremely able secretary , being an exceptionally fine linguist . i believe he speaks seven languages . it is for that reason that the prime minister chose him to accompany him to france . ”
christie	styles	poirot smiled . “ i have drawn certain conclusions—yes. ” summerhaye was still looking rather sceptical , but japp continued his scrutiny of poirot . “ it ’ s this way , ” he said , “ so far , we ’ ve only seen the case from the outside . that ’ s where the yard ’ s at a disadvantage in a case of this kind , where the murder ’ s only out , so to speak , after the inquest . a lot depends on being on the spot first thing , and that ’ s where mr. poirot ’ s had the start of us . we shouldn ’ t have been here as soon as this even , if it hadn ’ t been for the fact that there was a smart doctor on the spot , who gave us the tip through the coroner . but you ’ ve been on the spot from the first , and you may have picked up some little hints . from the evidence at the inquest , mr. inglethorp murdered his wife as sure as i stand here , and if anyone but you hinted the contrary i ’ d laugh in his face . i must say i was surprised the jury didn ’ t bring it in wilful murder against him right off . i think they would have , if it hadn ’ t been for the coroner—he seemed to be holding them back . ”
christie	styles	“ perhaps , though , you have a warrant for his arrest in your pocket now , ” suggested poirot . a kind of wooden shutter of officialdom came down from japp ’ s expressive countenance . “ perhaps i have , and perhaps i haven ’ t , ” he remarked dryly .
christie	styles	poirot looked at him thoughtfully . “ i am very anxious , messieurs , that he should not be arrested. ” “ i dare say , ” observed summerhaye sarcastically . japp was regarding poirot with comical perplexity . “ can ’ t you go a little further , mr. poirot ? a wink ’ s as good as a nod—from you . you ’ ve been on the spot—and the yard doesn ’ t want to make any mistakes , you know . ”
christie	styles	poirot nodded gravely . “ that is exactly what i thought . well , i will tell you this . use your warrant : arrest mr. inglethorp . but it will bring you no kudos—the case against him will be dismissed at once ! _comme ça ! _ ” and he snapped his fingers expressively .
christie	styles	japp ’ s face grew grave , though summerhaye gave an incredulous snort . as for me , i was literally dumb with astonishment . i could only conclude that poirot was mad . japp had taken out a handkerchief , and was gently dabbing his brow .
christie	styles	“ i daren ’ t do it , mr. poirot . _i_ ’ d take your word , but there ’ s others over me who ’ ll be asking what the devil i mean by it . can ’ t you give me a little more to go on ? ”
christie	styles	poirot reflected a moment . “ it can be done , ” he said at last . “ i admit i do not wish it . it forces my hand . i would have preferred to work in the dark just for the present , but what you say is very just—the word of a belgian policeman , whose day is past , is not enough ! and alfred inglethorp must not be arrested . that i have sworn , as my friend hastings here knows . see , then , my good japp , you go at once to styles ? ”
christie	styles	“ well , in about half an hour . we ’ re seeing the coroner and the doctor first. ” “ good . call for me in passing—the last house in the village . i will go with you . at styles , mr. inglethorp will give you , or if he refuses—as is probable—i will give you such proofs that shall satisfy you that the case against him could not possibly be sustained . is that a bargain ? ”
christie	styles	“ that ’ s a bargain , ” said japp heartily . “ and , on behalf of the yard , i ’ m much obliged to you , though i ’ m bound to confess i can ’ t at present see the faintest possible loop-hole in the evidence , but you always were a marvel ! so long , then , moosier . ”
christie	styles	the two detectives strode away , summerhaye with an incredulous grin on his face . “ well , my friend , ” cried poirot , before i could get in a word , “ what do you think ? _mon dieu ! _ i had some warm moments in that court ; i did not figure to myself that the man would be so pig-headed as to refuse to say anything at all . decidedly , it was the policy of an imbecile . ”
christie	styles	“ h ’ m ! there are other explanations besides that of imbecility , ” i remarked . “ for , if the case against him is true , how could he defend himself except by silence ? ” “ why , in a thousand ingenious ways , ” cried poirot . “ see ; say that it is i who have committed this murder , i can think of seven most plausible stories ! far more convincing than mr. inglethorp ’ s stony denials ! ”
christie	styles	i could not help laughing . “ my dear poirot , i am sure you are capable of thinking of seventy ! but , seriously , in spite of what i heard you say to the detectives , you surely can not still believe in the possibility of alfred inglethorp ’ s innocence ? ”
christie	styles	“ why not now as much as before ? nothing has changed. ” “ but the evidence is so conclusive. ” “ yes , too conclusive. ” we turned in at the gate of leastways cottage , and proceeded up the now familiar stairs .
christie	styles	“ yes , yes , too conclusive , ” continued poirot , almost to himself . “ real evidence is usually vague and unsatisfactory . it has to be examined—sifted . but here the whole thing is cut and dried . no , my friend , this evidence has been very cleverly manufactured—so cleverly that it has defeated its own ends . ”
christie	styles	“ how do you make that out ? ” “ because , so long as the evidence against him was vague and intangible , it was very hard to disprove . but , in his anxiety , the criminal has drawn the net so closely that one cut will set inglethorp free . ”
christie	styles	i was silent . and in a minute or two , poirot continued : “ let us look at the matter like this . here is a man , let us say , who sets out to poison his wife . he has lived by his wits as the saying goes . presumably , therefore , he has some wits . he is not altogether a fool . well , how does he set about it ? he goes boldly to the village chemist ’ s and purchases strychnine under his own name , with a trumped up story about a dog which is bound to be proved absurd . he does not employ the poison that night . no , he waits until he has had a violent quarrel with her , of which the whole household is cognisant , and which naturally directs their suspicions upon him . he prepares no defence—no shadow of an alibi , yet he knows the chemist ’ s assistant must necessarily come forward with the facts . bah ! do not ask me to believe that any man could be so idiotic ! only a lunatic , who wished to commit suicide by causing himself to be hanged , would act so ! ”
christie	styles	“ still—i do not see—— ” i began . “ neither do i see . i tell you , _mon ami_ , it puzzles me . _me_—hercule poirot ! ” “ but if you believe him innocent , how do you explain his buying the strychnine ? ”
christie	styles	“ very simply . he did _not_ buy it. ” “ but mace recognized him ! ” “ i beg your pardon , he saw a man with a black beard like mr. inglethorp ’ s , and wearing glasses like mr. inglethorp , and dressed in mr. inglethorp ’ s rather noticeable clothes . he could not recognize a man whom he had probably only seen in the distance , since , you remember , he himself had only been in the village a fortnight , and mrs. inglethorp dealt principally with coot ’ s in tadminster . ”
christie	styles	“ then you think—— ” “ _mon ami_ , do you remember the two points i laid stress upon ? leave the first one for the moment , what was the second ? ” “ the important fact that alfred inglethorp wears peculiar clothes , has a black beard , and uses glasses , ” i quoted .
christie	styles	“ exactly . now suppose anyone wished to pass himself off as john or lawrence cavendish . would it be easy ? ” “ no , ” i said thoughtfully . “ of course an actor—— ” but poirot cut me short ruthlessly .
christie	styles	“ and why would it not be easy ? i will tell you , my friend : because they are both clean-shaven men . to make up successfully as one of these two in broad daylight , it would need an actor of genius , and a certain initial facial resemblance . but in the case of alfred inglethorp , all that is changed . his clothes , his beard , the glasses which hide his eyes—those are the salient points about his personal appearance . now , what is the first instinct of the criminal ? to divert suspicion from himself , is it not so ? and how can he best do that ? by throwing it on someone else . in this instance , there was a man ready to his hand . everybody was predisposed to believe in mr. inglethorp ’ s guilt . it was a foregone conclusion that he would be suspected ; but , to make it a sure thing there must be tangible proof—such as the actual buying of the poison , and that , with a man of the peculiar appearance of mr. inglethorp , was not difficult . remember , this young mace had never actually spoken to mr. inglethorp . how should he doubt that the man in his clothes , with his beard and his glasses , was not alfred inglethorp ? ”
christie	styles	“ it may be so , ” i said , fascinated by poirot ’ s eloquence . “ but , if that was the case , why does he not say where he was at six o ’ clock on monday evening ? ”
christie	styles	“ ah , why indeed ? ” said poirot , calming down . “ if he were arrested , he probably would speak , but i do not want it to come to that . i must make him see the gravity of his position . there is , of course , something discreditable behind his silence . if he did not murder his wife , he is , nevertheless , a scoundrel , and has something of his own to conceal , quite apart from the murder . ”
christie	styles	“ what can it be ? ” i mused , won over to poirot ’ s views for the moment , although still retaining a faint conviction that the obvious deduction was the correct one . “ can you not guess ? ” asked poirot , smiling .
christie	styles	“ no , can you ? ” “ oh , yes , i had a little idea sometime ago—and it has turned out to be correct. ” “ you never told me , ” i said reproachfully . poirot spread out his hands apologetically .
christie	styles	“ pardon me , _mon ami_ , you were not precisely _sympathique_. ” he turned to me earnestly . “ tell me—you see now that he must not be arrested ? ” “ perhaps , ” i said doubtfully , for i was really quite indifferent to the fate of alfred inglethorp , and thought that a good fright would do him no harm .
christie	styles	poirot , who was watching me intently , gave a sigh . “ come , my friend , ” he said , changing the subject , “ apart from mr. inglethorp , how did the evidence at the inquest strike you ? ”
christie	styles	“ oh , pretty much what i expected. ” “ did nothing strike you as peculiar about it ? ” my thoughts flew to mary cavendish , and i hedged : “ in what way ? ” “ well , mr. lawrence cavendish ’ s evidence for instance ? ”
christie	styles	i was relieved . “ oh , lawrence ! no , i don ’ t think so . he ’ s always a nervous chap. ” “ his suggestion that his mother might have been poisoned accidentally by means of the tonic she was taking , that did not strike you as strange— _hein ? _ ”
christie	styles	“ no , i can ’ t say it did . the doctors ridiculed it of course . but it was quite a natural suggestion for a layman to make. ” “ but monsieur lawrence is not a layman . you told me yourself that he had started by studying medicine , and that he had taken his degree . ”
christie	styles	“ yes , that ’ s true . i never thought of that. ” i was rather startled . “ it _is_ odd. ” poirot nodded . “ from the first , his behaviour has been peculiar . of all the household , he alone would be likely to recognize the symptoms of strychnine poisoning , and yet we find him the only member of the family to uphold strenuously the theory of death from natural causes . if it had been monsieur john , i could have understood it . he has no technical knowledge , and is by nature unimaginative . but monsieur lawrence—no ! and now , to-day , he puts forward a suggestion that he himself must have known was ridiculous . there is food for thought in this , _mon ami ! _ ”
christie	styles	“ it ’ s very confusing , ” i agreed . “ then there is mrs. cavendish , ” continued poirot . “ that ’ s another who is not telling all she knows ! what do you make of her attitude ? ” “ i don ’ t know what to make of it . it seems inconceivable that she should be shielding alfred inglethorp . yet that is what it looks like . ”
christie	styles	poirot nodded reflectively . “ yes , it is queer . one thing is certain , she overheard a good deal more of that ‘ private conversation ’ than she was willing to admit. ” “ and yet she is the last person one would accuse of stooping to eavesdrop ! ”
christie	styles	“ exactly . one thing her evidence _has_ shown me . i made a mistake . dorcas was quite right . the quarrel did take place earlier in the afternoon , about four o ’ clock , as she said . ”
christie	styles	i looked at him curiously . i had never understood his insistence on that point . “ yes , a good deal that was peculiar came out to-day , ” continued poirot . “ dr . bauerstein , now , what was _he_ doing up and dressed at that hour in the morning ? it is astonishing to me that no one commented on the fact . ”
christie	styles	“ he has insomnia , i believe , ” i said doubtfully . “ which is a very good , or a very bad explanation , ” remarked poirot . “ it covers everything , and explains nothing . i shall keep my eye on our clever dr. bauerstein . ”
christie	styles	“ any more faults to find with the evidence ? ” i inquired satirically . “ _mon ami_ , ” replied poirot gravely , “ when you find that people are not telling you the truth—look out ! now , unless i am much mistaken , at the inquest to-day only one—at most , two persons were speaking the truth without reservation or subterfuge . ”
christie	styles	“ oh , come now , poirot ! i won ’ t cite lawrence , or mrs. cavendish . but there ’ s john—and miss howard , surely they were speaking the truth ? ” “ both of them , my friend ? one , i grant you , but both—— ! ”
christie	styles	his words gave me an unpleasant shock . miss howard ’ s evidence , unimportant as it was , had been given in such a downright straightforward manner that it had never occurred to me to doubt her sincerity . still , i had a great respect for poirot ’ s sagacity—except on the occasions when he was what i described to myself as “ foolishly pig-headed . ”
christie	styles	“ do you really think so ? ” i asked . “ miss howard had always seemed to me so essentially honest—almost uncomfortably so. ” poirot gave me a curious look , which i could not quite fathom . he seemed to speak , and then checked himself .
christie	styles	“ miss murdoch too , ” i continued , “ there ’ s nothing untruthful about _her_. ” “ no . but it was strange that she never heard a sound , sleeping next door ; whereas mrs. cavendish , in the other wing of the building , distinctly heard the table fall . ”
christie	styles	“ well , she ’ s young . and she sleeps soundly. ” “ ah , yes , indeed ! she must be a famous sleeper , that one ! ” i did not quite like the tone of his voice , but at that moment a smart knock reached our ears , and looking out of the window we perceived the two detectives waiting for us below .
christie	styles	poirot seized his hat , gave a ferocious twist to his moustache , and , carefully brushing an imaginary speck of dust from his sleeve , motioned me to precede him down the stairs ; there we joined the detectives and set out for styles .
christie	styles	i think the appearance of the two scotland yard men was rather a shock—especially to john , though of course after the verdict , he had realized that it was only a matter of time . still , the presence of the detectives brought the truth home to him more than anything else could have done .
christie	styles	poirot had conferred with japp in a low tone on the way up , and it was the latter functionary who requested that the household , with the exception of the servants , should be assembled together in the drawing-room . i realized the significance of this . it was up to poirot to make his boast good .
christie	styles	personally , i was not sanguine . poirot might have excellent reasons for his belief in inglethorp ’ s innocence , but a man of the type of summerhaye would require tangible proofs , and these i doubted if poirot could supply .
christie	styles	before very long we had all trooped into the drawing-room , the door of which japp closed . poirot politely set chairs for everyone . the scotland yard men were the cynosure of all eyes . i think that for the first time we realized that the thing was not a bad dream , but a tangible reality . we had read of such things—now we ourselves were actors in the drama . to-morrow the daily papers , all over england , would blazon out the news in staring headlines :
christie	styles	“ mysterious tragedy in essex ” “ wealthy lady poisoned ” there would be pictures of styles , snap-shots of “ the family leaving the inquest ” —the village photographer had not been idle ! all the things that one had read a hundred times—things that happen to other people , not to oneself . and now , in this house , a murder had been committed . in front of us were “ the detectives in charge of the case. ” the well-known glib phraseology passed rapidly through my mind in the interval before poirot opened the proceedings .
christie	styles	i think everyone was a little surprised that it should be he and not one of the official detectives who took the initiative . “ _mesdames_ and _messieurs_ , ” said poirot , bowing as though he were a celebrity about to deliver a lecture , “ i have asked you to come here all together , for a certain object . that object , it concerns mr. alfred inglethorp . ”
christie	styles	inglethorp was sitting a little by himself—i think , unconsciously , everyone had drawn his chair slightly away from him—and he gave a faint start as poirot pronounced his name . “ mr . inglethorp , ” said poirot , addressing him directly , “ a very dark shadow is resting on this house—the shadow of murder . ”
christie	styles	inglethorp shook his head sadly . “ my poor wife , ” he murmured . “ poor emily ! it is terrible. ” “ i do not think , monsieur , ” said poirot pointedly , “ that you quite realize how terrible it may be—for you. ” and as inglethorp did not appear to understand , he added : “ mr . inglethorp , you are standing in very grave danger . ”
christie	styles	the two detectives fidgeted . i saw the official caution “ anything you say will be used in evidence against you , ” actually hovering on summerhaye ’ s lips . poirot went on . “ do you understand now , monsieur ? ”
christie	styles	“ no . what do you mean ? ” “ i mean , ” said poirot deliberately , “ that you are suspected of poisoning your wife. ” a little gasp ran round the circle at this plain speaking . “ good heavens ! ” cried inglethorp , starting up . “ what a monstrous idea ! _i_—poison my dearest emily ! ”
christie	styles	“ i do not think ” —poirot watched him narrowly— “ that you quite realize the unfavourable nature of your evidence at the inquest . mr. inglethorp , knowing what i have now told you , do you still refuse to say where you were at six o ’ clock on monday afternoon ? ”
christie	styles	with a groan , alfred inglethorp sank down again and buried his face in his hands . poirot approached and stood over him . “ speak ! ” he cried menacingly . with an effort , inglethorp raised his face from his hands . then , slowly and deliberately , he shook his head .
christie	styles	“ you will not speak ? ” “ no . i do not believe that anyone could be so monstrous as to accuse me of what you say. ” poirot nodded thoughtfully , like a man whose mind is made up .
christie	styles	“ _soit ! _ ” he said . “ then i must speak for you. ” alfred inglethorp sprang up again . “ you ? how can you speak ? you do not know—— ” he broke off abruptly . poirot turned to face us . “ _mesdames_ and _messieurs_ ! i speak ! listen ! i , hercule poirot , affirm that the man who entered the chemist ’ s shop , and purchased strychnine at six o ’ clock on monday last was not mr. inglethorp , for at six o ’ clock on that day mr. inglethorp was escorting mrs. raikes back to her home from a neighbouring farm . i can produce no less than five witnesses to swear to having seen them together , either at six or just after and , as you may know , the abbey farm , mrs. raikes ’ s home , is at least two and a half miles distant from the village . there is absolutely no question as to the alibi ! ”
christie	styles	chapter viii . fresh suspicions there was a moment ’ s stupefied silence . japp , who was the least surprised of any of us , was the first to speak . “ my word , ” he cried , “ you ’ re the goods ! and no mistake , mr. poirot ! these witnesses of yours are all right , i suppose ? ”
christie	styles	“ _voilà ! _ i have prepared a list of them—names and addresses . you must see them , of course . but you will find it all right. ” “ i ’ m sure of that. ” japp lowered his voice . “ i ’ m much obliged to you . a pretty mare ’ s nest arresting him would have been. ” he turned to inglethorp . “ but , if you ’ ll excuse me , sir , why couldn ’ t you say all this at the inquest ? ”
christie	styles	“ i will tell you why , ” interrupted poirot . “ there was a certain rumour—— ” “ a most malicious and utterly untrue one , ” interrupted alfred inglethorp in an agitated voice . “ and mr. inglethorp was anxious to have no scandal revived just at present . am i right ? ”
christie	styles	“ quite right. ” inglethorp nodded . “ with my poor emily not yet buried , can you wonder i was anxious that no more lying rumours should be started. ” “ between you and me , sir , ” remarked japp , “ i ’ d sooner have any amount of rumours than be arrested for murder . and i venture to think your poor lady would have felt the same . and , if it hadn ’ t been for mr. poirot here , arrested you would have been , as sure as eggs is eggs ! ”
christie	styles	“ i was foolish , no doubt , ” murmured inglethorp . “ but you do not know , inspector , how i have been persecuted and maligned. ” and he shot a baleful glance at evelyn howard . “ now , sir , ” said japp , turning briskly to john , “ i should like to see the lady ’ s bedroom , please , and after that i ’ ll have a little chat with the servants . don ’ t you bother about anything . mr. poirot , here , will show me the way . ”
christie	styles	as they all went out of the room , poirot turned and made me a sign to follow him upstairs . there he caught me by the arm , and drew me aside .
christie	styles	“ quick , go to the other wing . stand there—just this side of the baize door . do not move till i come. ” then , turning rapidly , he rejoined the two detectives . i followed his instructions , taking up my position by the baize door , and wondering what on earth lay behind the request . why was i to stand in this particular spot on guard ? i looked thoughtfully down the corridor in front of me . an idea struck me . with the exception of cynthia murdoch ’ s , everyone ’ s room was in this left wing . had that anything to do with it ? was i to report who came or went ? i stood faithfully at my post . the minutes passed . nobody came . nothing happened .
christie	styles	it must have been quite twenty minutes before poirot rejoined me . “ you have not stirred ? ” “ no , i ’ ve stuck here like a rock . nothing ’ s happened. ” “ ah ! ” was he pleased , or disappointed ? “ you ’ ve seen nothing at all ? ”
christie	styles	“ no. ” “ but you have probably heard something ? a big bump—eh , _mon ami ? _ ” “ no. ” “ is it possible ? ah , but i am vexed with myself ! i am not usually clumsy . i made but a slight gesture ” —i know poirot ’ s gestures— “ with the left hand , and over went the table by the bed ! ”
christie	styles	he looked so childishly vexed and crest-fallen that i hastened to console him . “ never mind , old chap . what does it matter ? your triumph downstairs excited you . i can tell you , that was a surprise to us all . there must be more in this affair of inglethorp ’ s with mrs. raikes than we thought , to make him hold his tongue so persistently . what are you going to do now ? where are the scotland yard fellows ? ”
christie	styles	“ gone down to interview the servants . i showed them all our exhibits . i am disappointed in japp . he has no method ! ” “ hullo ! ” i said , looking out of the window . “ here ’ s dr. bauerstein . i believe you ’ re right about that man , poirot . i don ’ t like him . ”
christie	styles	“ he is clever , ” observed poirot meditatively . “ oh , clever as the devil ! i must say i was overjoyed to see him in the plight he was in on tuesday . you never saw such a spectacle ! ” and i described the doctor ’ s adventure . “ he looked a regular scarecrow ! plastered with mud from head to foot . ”
christie	styles	“ you saw him , then ? ” “ yes . of course , he didn ’ t want to come in—it was just after dinner—but mr. inglethorp insisted. ” “ what ? ” poirot caught me violently by the shoulders . “ was dr. bauerstein here on tuesday evening ? here ? and you never told me ? why did you not tell me ? why ? why ? ”
christie	styles	he appeared to be in an absolute frenzy . “ my dear poirot , ” i expostulated , “ i never thought it would interest you . i didn ’ t know it was of any importance. ” “ importance ? it is of the first importance ! so dr. bauerstein was here on tuesday night—the night of the murder . hastings , do you not see ? that alters everything—everything ! ”
christie	styles	i had never seen him so upset . loosening his hold of me , he mechanically straightened a pair of candlesticks , still murmuring to himself : “ yes , that alters everything—everything. ” suddenly he seemed to come to a decision .
christie	styles	“ _allons ! _ ” he said . “ we must act at once . where is mr. cavendish ? ” john was in the smoking-room . poirot went straight to him . “ mr . cavendish , i have some important business in tadminster . a new clue . may i take your motor ? ”
christie	styles	“ why , of course . do you mean at once ? ” “ if you please. ” john rang the bell , and ordered round the car . in another ten minutes , we were racing down the park and along the high road to tadminster .
christie	styles	“ now , poirot , ” i remarked resignedly , “ perhaps you will tell me what all this is about ? ” “ well , _mon ami_ , a good deal you can guess for yourself . of course you realize that , now mr. inglethorp is out of it , the whole position is greatly changed . we are face to face with an entirely new problem . we know now that there is one person who did not buy the poison . we have cleared away the manufactured clues . now for the real ones . i have ascertained that anyone in the household , with the exception of mrs. cavendish , who was playing tennis with you , could have personated mr. inglethorp on monday evening . in the same way , we have his statement that he put the coffee down in the hall . no one took much notice of that at the inquest—but now it has a very different significance . we must find out who did take that coffee to mrs. inglethorp eventually , or who passed through the hall whilst it was standing there . from your account , there are only two people whom we can positively say did not go near the coffee—mrs . cavendish , and mademoiselle cynthia . ”
christie	styles	“ yes , that is so. ” i felt an inexpressible lightening of the heart . mary cavendish could certainly not rest under suspicion . “ in clearing alfred inglethorp , ” continued poirot , “ i have been obliged to show my hand sooner than i intended . as long as i might be thought to be pursuing him , the criminal would be off his guard . now , he will be doubly careful . yes—doubly careful. ” he turned to me abruptly . “ tell me , hastings , you yourself—have you no suspicions of anybody ? ”
christie	styles	i hesitated . to tell the truth , an idea , wild and extravagant in itself , had once or twice that morning flashed through my brain . i had rejected it as absurd , nevertheless it persisted .
christie	styles	“ you couldn ’ t call it a suspicion , ” i murmured . “ it ’ s so utterly foolish. ” “ come now , ” urged poirot encouragingly . “ do not fear . speak your mind . you should always pay attention to your instincts . ”
christie	styles	“ well then , ” i blurted out , “ it ’ s absurd—but i suspect miss howard of not telling all she knows ! ” “ miss howard ? ” “ yes—you ’ ll laugh at me—— ” “ not at all . why should i ? ” “ i can ’ t help feeling , ” i continued blunderingly ; “ that we ’ ve rather left her out of the possible suspects , simply on the strength of her having been away from the place . but , after all , she was only fifteen miles away . a car would do it in half an hour . can we say positively that she was away from styles on the night of the murder ? ”
christie	styles	“ yes , my friend , ” said poirot unexpectedly , “ we can . one of my first actions was to ring up the hospital where she was working. ” “ well ? ” “ well , i learnt that miss howard had been on afternoon duty on tuesday , and that—a convoy coming in unexpectedly—she had kindly offered to remain on night duty , which offer was gratefully accepted . that disposes of that . ”
christie	styles	“ oh ! ” i said , rather nonplussed . “ really , ” i continued , “ it ’ s her extraordinary vehemence against inglethorp that started me off suspecting her . i can ’ t help feeling she ’ d do anything against him . and i had an idea she might know something about the destroying of the will . she might have burnt the new one , mistaking it for the earlier one in his favour . she is so terribly bitter against him . ”
christie	styles	“ you consider her vehemence unnatural ? ” “ y—es . she is so very violent . i wondered really whether she is quite sane on that point. ” poirot shook his head energetically . “ no , no , you are on a wrong tack there . there is nothing weak-minded or degenerate about miss howard . she is an excellent specimen of well-balanced english beef and brawn . she is sanity itself . ”
christie	styles	“ yet her hatred of inglethorp seems almost a mania . my idea was—a very ridiculous one , no doubt—that she had intended to poison him—and that , in some way , mrs. inglethorp got hold of it by mistake . but i don ’ t at all see how it could have been done . the whole thing is absurd and ridiculous to the last degree . ”
christie	styles	“ still you are right in one thing . it is always wise to suspect everybody until you can prove logically , and to your own satisfaction , that they are innocent . now , what reasons are there against miss howard ’ s having deliberately poisoned mrs. inglethorp ? ”
christie	styles	“ why , she was devoted to her ! ” i exclaimed . “ tcha ! tcha ! ” cried poirot irritably . “ you argue like a child . if miss howard were capable of poisoning the old lady , she would be quite equally capable of simulating devotion . no , we must look elsewhere . you are perfectly correct in your assumption that her vehemence against alfred inglethorp is too violent to be natural ; but you are quite wrong in the deduction you draw from it . i have drawn my own deductions , which i believe to be correct , but i will not speak of them at present. ” he paused a minute , then went on . “ now , to my way of thinking , there is one insuperable objection to miss howard ’ s being the murderess . ”
christie	styles	“ and that is ? ” “ that in no possible way could mrs. inglethorp ’ s death benefit miss howard . now there is no murder without a motive. ” i reflected . “ could not mrs. inglethorp have made a will in her favour ? ”
christie	styles	poirot shook his head . “ but you yourself suggested that possibility to mr. wells ? ” poirot smiled . “ that was for a reason . i did not want to mention the name of the person who was actually in my mind . miss howard occupied very much the same position , so i used her name instead . ”
christie	styles	“ still , mrs. inglethorp might have done so . why , that will , made on the afternoon of her death may—— ” but poirot ’ s shake of the head was so energetic that i stopped .
christie	styles	“ no , my friend . i have certain little ideas of my own about that will . but i can tell you this much—it was not in miss howard ’ s favour. ” i accepted his assurance , though i did not really see how he could be so positive about the matter .
christie	styles	“ well , ” i said , with a sigh , “ we will acquit miss howard , then . it is partly your fault that i ever came to suspect her . it was what you said about her evidence at the inquest that set me off . ”
christie	styles	poirot looked puzzled . “ what did i say about her evidence at the inquest ? ” “ don ’ t you remember ? when i cited her and john cavendish as being above suspicion ? ” “ oh—ah—yes. ” he seemed a little confused , but recovered himself . “ by the way , hastings , there is something i want you to do for me . ”
christie	styles	“ certainly . what is it ? ” “ next time you happen to be alone with lawrence cavendish , i want you to say this to him . ‘ i have a message for you , from poirot . he says : “ find the extra coffee-cup , and you can rest in peace ! ” ’ nothing more . nothing less . ”
christie	styles	“ ‘ find the extra coffee-cup , and you can rest in peace. ’ is that right ? ” i asked , much mystified . “ excellent. ” “ but what does it mean ? ” “ ah , that i will leave you to find out . you have access to the facts . just say that to him , and see what he says . ”
christie	styles	“ very well—but it ’ s all extremely mysterious. ” we were running into tadminster now , and poirot directed the car to the “ analytical chemist. ” poirot hopped down briskly , and went inside . in a few minutes he was back again .
christie	styles	“ there , ” he said . “ that is all my business. ” “ what were you doing there ? ” i asked , in lively curiosity . “ i left something to be analysed. ” “ yes , but what ? ” “ the sample of cocoa i took from the saucepan in the bedroom . ”
christie	styles	“ but that has already been tested ! ” i cried , stupefied . “ dr . bauerstein had it tested , and you yourself laughed at the possibility of there being strychnine in it. ” “ i know dr. bauerstein had it tested , ” replied poirot quietly .
christie	styles	“ well , then ? ” “ well , i have a fancy for having it analysed again , that is all. ” and not another word on the subject could i drag out of him . this proceeding of poirot ’ s , in respect of the cocoa , puzzled me intensely . i could see neither rhyme nor reason in it . however , my confidence in him , which at one time had rather waned , was fully restored since his belief in alfred inglethorp ’ s innocence had been so triumphantly vindicated .
christie	styles	the funeral of mrs. inglethorp took place the following day , and on monday , as i came down to a late breakfast , john drew me aside , and informed me that mr. inglethorp was leaving that morning , to take up his quarters at the stylites arms until he should have completed his plans .
christie	styles	“ and really it ’ s a great relief to think he ’ s going , hastings , ” continued my honest friend . “ it was bad enough before , when we thought he ’ d done it , but i ’ m hanged if it isn ’ t worse now , when we all feel guilty for having been so down on the fellow . the fact is , we ’ ve treated him abominably . of course , things did look black against him . i don ’ t see how anyone could blame us for jumping to the conclusions we did . still , there it is , we were in the wrong , and now there ’ s a beastly feeling that one ought to make amends ; which is difficult , when one doesn ’ t like the fellow a bit better than one did before . the whole thing ’ s damned awkward ! and i ’ m thankful he ’ s had the tact to take himself off . it ’ s a good thing styles wasn ’ t the mater ’ s to leave to him . couldn ’ t bear to think of the fellow lording it here . he ’ s welcome to her money . ”
christie	styles	“ you ’ ll be able to keep up the place all right ? ” i asked . “ oh , yes . there are the death duties , of course , but half my father ’ s money goes with the place , and lawrence will stay with us for the present , so there is his share as well . we shall be pinched at first , of course , because , as i once told you , i am in a bit of a hole financially myself . still , the johnnies will wait now . ”
christie	styles	in the general relief at inglethorp ’ s approaching departure , we had the most genial breakfast we had experienced since the tragedy . cynthia , whose young spirits were naturally buoyant , was looking quite her pretty self again , and we all , with the exception of lawrence , who seemed unalterably gloomy and nervous , were quietly cheerful , at the opening of a new and hopeful future .
christie	styles	the papers , of course , had been full of the tragedy . glaring headlines , sandwiched biographies of every member of the household , subtle innuendoes , the usual familiar tag about the police having a clue . nothing was spared us . it was a slack time . the war was momentarily inactive , and the newspapers seized with avidity on this crime in fashionable life : “ the mysterious affair at styles ” was the topic of the moment .
christie	styles	naturally it was very annoying for the cavendishes . the house was constantly besieged by reporters , who were consistently denied admission , but who continued to haunt the village and the grounds , where they lay in wait with cameras , for any unwary members of the household . we all lived in a blast of publicity . the scotland yard men came and went , examining , questioning , lynx-eyed and reserved of tongue . towards what end they were working , we did not know . had they any clue , or would the whole thing remain in the category of undiscovered crimes ?
christie	styles	after breakfast , dorcas came up to me rather mysteriously , and asked if she might have a few words with me . “ certainly . what is it , dorcas ? ” “ well , it ’ s just this , sir . you ’ ll be seeing the belgian gentleman to-day perhaps ? ” i nodded . “ well , sir , you know how he asked me so particular if the mistress , or anyone else , had a green dress ? ”
christie	styles	“ yes , yes . you have found one ? ” my interest was aroused . “ no , not that , sir . but since then i ’ ve remembered what the young gentlemen ” —john and lawrence were still the “ young gentlemen ” to dorcas— “ call the ‘ dressing-up box. ’ it ’ s up in the front attic , sir . a great chest , full of old clothes and fancy dresses , and what not . and it came to me sudden like that there might be a green dress amongst them . so , if you ’ d tell the belgian gentleman—— ”
christie	styles	“ i will tell him , dorcas , ” i promised . “ thank you very much , sir . a very nice gentleman he is , sir . and quite a different class from them two detectives from london , what goes prying about , and asking questions . i don ’ t hold with foreigners as a rule , but from what the newspapers say i make out as how these brave belges isn ’ t the ordinary run of foreigners , and certainly he ’ s a most polite spoken gentleman . ”
christie	styles	dear old dorcas ! as she stood there , with her honest face upturned to mine , i thought what a fine specimen she was of the old-fashioned servant that is so fast dying out .
christie	styles	i thought i might as well go down to the village at once , and look up poirot ; but i met him half-way , coming up to the house , and at once gave him dorcas ’ s message .
christie	styles	“ ah , the brave dorcas ! we will look at the chest , although—but no matter—we will examine it all the same. ” we entered the house by one of the windows . there was no one in the hall , and we went straight up to the attic .
christie	styles	sure enough , there was the chest , a fine old piece , all studded with brass nails , and full to overflowing with every imaginable type of garment . poirot bundled everything out on the floor with scant ceremony . there were one or two green fabrics of varying shades ; but poirot shook his head over them all . he seemed somewhat apathetic in the search , as though he expected no great results from it . suddenly he gave an exclamation .
christie	styles	“ what is it ? ” “ look ! ” the chest was nearly empty , and there , reposing right at the bottom , was a magnificent black beard . “ _ohó ! _ ” said poirot . “ _ohó ! _ ” he turned it over in his hands , examining it closely . “ new , ” he remarked . “ yes , quite new . ”
christie	styles	after a moment ’ s hesitation , he replaced it in the chest , heaped all the other things on top of it as before , and made his way briskly downstairs . he went straight to the pantry , where we found dorcas busily polishing her silver .
christie	styles	poirot wished her good morning with gallic politeness , and went on : “ we have been looking through that chest , dorcas . i am much obliged to you for mentioning it . there is , indeed , a fine collection there . are they often used , may i ask ? ”
christie	styles	“ well , sir , not very often nowadays , though from time to time we do have what the young gentlemen call ‘ a dress-up night. ’ and very funny it is sometimes , sir . mr. lawrence , he ’ s wonderful . most comic ! i shall never forget the night he came down as the char of persia , i think he called it—a sort of eastern king it was . he had the big paper knife in his hand , and ‘ mind , dorcas , ’ he says , ‘ you ’ ll have to be very respectful . this is my specially sharpened scimitar , and it ’ s off with your head if i ’ m at all displeased with you ! ’ miss cynthia , she was what they call an apache , or some such name—a frenchified sort of cut-throat , i take it to be . a real sight she looked . you ’ d never have believed a pretty young lady like that could have made herself into such a ruffian . nobody would have known her . ”
christie	styles	“ these evenings must have been great fun , ” said poirot genially . “ i suppose mr. lawrence wore that fine black beard in the chest upstairs , when he was shah of persia ? ” “ he did have a beard , sir , ” replied dorcas , smiling . “ and well i know it , for he borrowed two skeins of my black wool to make it with ! and i ’ m sure it looked wonderfully natural at a distance . i didn ’ t know as there was a beard up there at all . it must have been got quite lately , i think . there was a red wig , i know , but nothing else in the way of hair . burnt corks they use mostly—though ‘ tis messy getting it off again . miss cynthia was a nigger once , and , oh , the trouble she had . ”
christie	styles	“ so dorcas knows nothing about that black beard , ” said poirot thoughtfully , as we walked out into the hall again . “ do you think it is _the_ one ? ” i whispered eagerly . poirot nodded .
christie	styles	“ i do . you notice it had been trimmed ? ” “ no. ” “ yes . it was cut exactly the shape of mr. inglethorp ’ s , and i found one or two snipped hairs . hastings , this affair is very deep . ”
christie	styles	“ who put it in the chest , i wonder ? ” “ someone with a good deal of intelligence , ” remarked poirot dryly . “ you realize that he chose the one place in the house to hide it where its presence would not be remarked ? yes , he is intelligent . but we must be more intelligent . we must be so intelligent that he does not suspect us of being intelligent at all . ”
christie	styles	i acquiesced . “ there , _mon ami_ , you will be of great assistance to me. ” i was pleased with the compliment . there had been times when i hardly thought that poirot appreciated me at my true worth .
christie	styles	“ yes , ” he continued , staring at me thoughtfully , “ you will be invaluable. ” this was naturally gratifying , but poirot ’ s next words were not so welcome . “ i must have an ally in the house , ” he observed reflectively .
christie	styles	“ you have me , ” i protested . “ true , but you are not sufficient. ” i was hurt , and showed it . poirot hurried to explain himself . “ you do not quite take my meaning . you are known to be working with me . i want somebody who is not associated with us in any way . ”
christie	styles	“ oh , i see . how about john ? ” “ no , i think not. ” “ the dear fellow isn ’ t perhaps very bright , ” i said thoughtfully . “ here comes miss howard , ” said poirot suddenly . “ she is the very person . but i am in her black books , since i cleared mr. inglethorp . still , we can but try . ”
christie	styles	with a nod that was barely civil , miss howard assented to poirot ’ s request for a few minutes ’ conversation . we went into the little morning-room , and poirot closed the door . “ well , monsieur poirot , ” said miss howard impatiently , “ what is it ? out with it . i ’ m busy . ”
christie	styles	“ do you remember , mademoiselle , that i once asked you to help me ? ” “ yes , i do. ” the lady nodded . “ and i told you i ’ d help you with pleasure—to hang alfred inglethorp . ”
christie	styles	“ ah ! ” poirot studied her seriously . “ miss howard , i will ask you one question . i beg of you to reply to it truthfully. ” “ never tell lies , ” replied miss howard . “ it is this . do you still believe that mrs. inglethorp was poisoned by her husband ? ”
christie	styles	“ what do you mean ? ” she asked sharply . “ you needn ’ t think your pretty explanations influence me in the slightest . i ’ ll admit that it wasn ’ t he who bought strychnine at the chemist ’ s shop . what of that ? i dare say he soaked fly paper , as i told you at the beginning . ”
christie	styles	“ that is arsenic—not strychnine , ” said poirot mildly . “ what does that matter ? arsenic would put poor emily out of the way just as well as strychnine . if i ’ m convinced he did it , it doesn ’ t matter a jot to me _how_ he did it . ”
christie	styles	“ exactly . _if_ you are convinced he did it , ” said poirot quietly . “ i will put my question in another form . did you ever in your heart of hearts believe that mrs. inglethorp was poisoned by her husband ? ”
christie	styles	“ good heavens ! ” cried miss howard . “ haven ’ t i always told you the man is a villain ? haven ’ t i always told you he would murder her in her bed ? haven ’ t i always hated him like poison ? ”
christie	styles	“ exactly , ” said poirot . “ that bears out my little idea entirely. ” “ what little idea ? ” “ miss howard , do you remember a conversation that took place on the day of my friend ’ s arrival here ? he repeated it to me , and there is a sentence of yours that has impressed me very much . do you remember affirming that if a crime had been committed , and anyone you loved had been murdered , you felt certain that you would know by instinct who the criminal was , even if you were quite unable to prove it ? ”
christie	styles	“ yes , i remember saying that . i believe it too . i suppose you think it nonsense ? ” “ not at all. ” “ and yet you will pay no attention to my instinct against alfred inglethorp . ”
christie	styles	“ no , ” said poirot curtly . “ because your instinct is not against mr. inglethorp. ” “ what ? ” “ no . you wish to believe he committed the crime . you believe him capable of committing it . but your instinct tells you he did not commit it . it tells you more—shall i go on ? ”
christie	styles	she was staring at him , fascinated , and made a slight affirmative movement of the hand . “ shall i tell you why you have been so vehement against mr. inglethorp ? it is because you have been trying to believe what you wish to believe . it is because you are trying to drown and stifle your instinct , which tells you another name—— ”
christie	styles	“ no , no , no ! ” cried miss howard wildly , flinging up her hands . “ don ’ t say it ! oh , don ’ t say it ! it isn ’ t true ! it can ’ t be true . i don ’ t know what put such a wild—such a dreadful—idea into my head ! ”
christie	styles	“ i am right , am i not ? ” asked poirot . “ yes , yes ; you must be a wizard to have guessed . but it can ’ t be so—it ’ s too monstrous , too impossible . it _must_ be alfred inglethorp . ”
christie	styles	poirot shook his head gravely . “ don ’ t ask me about it , ” continued miss howard , “ because i shan ’ t tell you . i won ’ t admit it , even to myself . i must be mad to think of such a thing . ”
christie	styles	poirot nodded , as if satisfied . “ i will ask you nothing . it is enough for me that it is as i thought . and i—i , too , have an instinct . we are working together towards a common end . ”
christie	styles	“ don ’ t ask me to help you , because i won ’ t . i wouldn ’ t lift a finger to—to—— ” she faltered . “ you will help me in spite of yourself . i ask you nothing—but you will be my ally . you will not be able to help yourself . you will do the only thing that i want of you . ”
christie	styles	“ and that is ? ” “ you will watch ! ” evelyn howard bowed her head . “ yes , i can ’ t help doing that . i am always watching—always hoping i shall be proved wrong. ” “ if we are wrong , well and good , ” said poirot . “ no one will be more pleased than i shall . but , if we are right ? if we are right , miss howard , on whose side are you then ? ”
christie	styles	“ i don ’ t know , i don ’ t know—— ” “ come now. ” “ it could be hushed up. ” “ there must be no hushing up. ” “ but emily herself—— ” she broke off . “ miss howard , ” said poirot gravely , “ this is unworthy of you . ”
christie	styles	suddenly she took her face from her hands . “ yes , ” she said quietly , “ that was not evelyn howard who spoke ! ” she flung her head up proudly . “ _this_ is evelyn howard ! and she is on the side of justice ! let the cost be what it may. ” and with these words , she walked firmly out of the room .
christie	styles	“ there , ” said poirot , looking after her , “ goes a very valuable ally . that woman , hastings , has got brains as well as a heart. ” i did not reply . “ instinct is a marvellous thing , ” mused poirot . “ it can neither be explained nor ignored . ”
christie	styles	“ you and miss howard seem to know what you are talking about , ” i observed coldly . “ perhaps you don ’ t realize that _i_ am still in the dark. ” “ really ? is that so , _mon ami ? _ ”
christie	styles	“ yes . enlighten me , will you ? ” poirot studied me attentively for a moment or two . then , to my intense surprise , he shook his head decidedly . “ no , my friend. ” “ oh , look here , why not ? ”
christie	styles	“ two is enough for a secret. ” “ well , i think it is very unfair to keep back facts from me. ” “ i am not keeping back facts . every fact that i know is in your possession . you can draw your own deductions from them . this time it is a question of ideas . ”
christie	styles	“ still , it would be interesting to know. ” poirot looked at me very earnestly , and again shook his head . “ you see , ” he said sadly , “ _you_ have no instincts. ” “ it was intelligence you were requiring just now , ” i pointed out .
christie	styles	“ the two often go together , ” said poirot enigmatically . the remark seemed so utterly irrelevant that i did not even take the trouble to answer it . but i decided that if i made any interesting and important discoveries—as no doubt i should—i would keep them to myself , and surprise poirot with the ultimate result .
christie	styles	there are times when it is one ’ s duty to assert oneself . chapter ix . dr. bauerstein i had had no opportunity as yet of passing on poirot ’ s message to lawrence . but now , as i strolled out on the lawn , still nursing a grudge against my friend ’ s high-handedness , i saw lawrence on the croquet lawn , aimlessly knocking a couple of very ancient balls about , with a still more ancient mallet .
christie	styles	it struck me that it would be a good opportunity to deliver my message . otherwise , poirot himself might relieve me of it . it was true that i did not quite gather its purport , but i flattered myself that by lawrence ’ s reply , and perhaps a little skillful cross-examination on my part , i should soon perceive its significance . accordingly i accosted him .
christie	styles	“ i ’ ve been looking for you , ” i remarked untruthfully . “ have you ? ” “ yes . the truth is , i ’ ve got a message for you—from poirot. ” “ yes ? ” “ he told me to wait until i was alone with you , ” i said , dropping my voice significantly , and watching him intently out of the corner of my eye . i have always been rather good at what is called , i believe , creating an atmosphere .
christie	styles	“ well ? ” there was no change of expression in the dark melancholic face . had he any idea of what i was about to say ? “ this is the message. ” i dropped my voice still lower . “ ‘ find the extra coffee-cup , and you can rest in peace . ’ ”
christie	styles	“ what on earth does he mean ? ” lawrence stared at me in quite unaffected astonishment . “ don ’ t you know ? ” “ not in the least . do you ? ” i was compelled to shake my head .
christie	styles	“ what extra coffee-cup ? ” “ i don ’ t know. ” “ he ’ d better ask dorcas , or one of the maids , if he wants to know about coffee-cups . it ’ s their business , not mine . i don ’ t know anything about the coffee-cups , except that we ’ ve got some that are never used , which are a perfect dream ! old worcester . you ’ re not a connoisseur , are you , hastings ? ”
christie	styles	i shook my head . “ you miss a lot . a really perfect bit of old china—it ’ s pure delight to handle it , or even to look at it. ” “ well , what am i to tell poirot ? ”
christie	styles	“ tell him i don ’ t know what he ’ s talking about . it ’ s double dutch to me. ” “ all right. ” i was moving off towards the house again when he suddenly called me back .
christie	styles	“ i say , what was the end of that message ? say it over again , will you ? ” “ ‘ find the extra coffee-cup , and you can rest in peace. ’ are you sure you don ’ t know what it means ? ” i asked him earnestly .
christie	styles	he shook his head . “ no , ” he said musingly , “ i don ’ t . i—i wish i did. ” the boom of the gong sounded from the house , and we went in together . poirot had been asked by john to remain to lunch , and was already seated at the table .
christie	styles	by tacit consent , all mention of the tragedy was barred . we conversed on the war , and other outside topics . but after the cheese and biscuits had been handed round , and dorcas had left the room , poirot suddenly leant forward to mrs. cavendish .
christie	styles	“ pardon me , madame , for recalling unpleasant memories , but i have a little idea ” —poirot ’ s “ little ideas ” were becoming a perfect byword— “ and would like to ask one or two questions. ” “ of me ? certainly . ”
christie	styles	“ you are too amiable , madame . what i want to ask is this : the door leading into mrs. inglethorp ’ s room from that of mademoiselle cynthia , it was bolted , you say ? ” “ certainly it was bolted , ” replied mary cavendish , rather surprised . “ i said so at the inquest . ”
christie	styles	“ bolted ? ” “ yes. ” she looked perplexed . “ i mean , ” explained poirot , “ you are sure it was bolted , and not merely locked ? ” “ oh , i see what you mean . no , i don ’ t know . i said bolted , meaning that it was fastened , and i could not open it , but i believe all the doors were found bolted on the inside . ”
christie	styles	“ still , as far as you are concerned , the door might equally well have been locked ? ” “ oh , yes. ” “ you yourself did not happen to notice , madame , when you entered mrs. inglethorp ’ s room , whether that door was bolted or not ? ”
christie	styles	“ i—i believe it was. ” “ but you did not see it ? ” “ no . i—never looked. ” “ but _i_ did , ” interrupted lawrence suddenly . “ i happened to notice that it _was_ bolted. ” “ ah , that settles it. ” and poirot looked crestfallen .
christie	styles	i could not help rejoicing that , for once , one of his “ little ideas ” had come to naught . after lunch poirot begged me to accompany him home . i consented rather stiffly .
christie	styles	“ you are annoyed , is it not so ? ” he asked anxiously , as we walked through the park . “ not at all , ” i said coldly . “ that is well . that lifts a great load from my mind . ”
christie	styles	this was not quite what i had intended . i had hoped that he would have observed the stiffness of my manner . still , the fervour of his words went towards the appeasing of my just displeasure . i thawed .
christie	styles	“ i gave lawrence your message , ” i said . “ and what did he say ? he was entirely puzzled ? ” “ yes . i am quite sure he had no idea of what you meant. ” i had expected poirot to be disappointed ; but , to my surprise , he replied that that was as he had thought , and that he was very glad . my pride forbade me to ask any questions .
christie	styles	poirot switched off on another tack . “ mademoiselle cynthia was not at lunch to-day ? how was that ? ” “ she is at the hospital again . she resumed work to-day. ” “ ah , she is an industrious little demoiselle . and pretty too . she is like pictures i have seen in italy . i would rather like to see that dispensary of hers . do you think she would show it to me ? ”
christie	styles	“ i am sure she would be delighted . it ’ s an interesting little place. ” “ does she go there every day ? ” “ she has all wednesdays off , and comes back to lunch on saturdays . those are her only times off . ”
christie	styles	“ i will remember . women are doing great work nowadays , and mademoiselle cynthia is clever—oh , yes , she has brains , that little one. ” “ yes . i believe she has passed quite a stiff exam . ”
christie	styles	“ without doubt . after all , it is very responsible work . i suppose they have very strong poisons there ? ” “ yes , she showed them to us . they are kept locked up in a little cupboard . i believe they have to be very careful . they always take out the key before leaving the room . ”
christie	styles	“ indeed . it is near the window , this cupboard ? ” “ no , right the other side of the room . why ? ” poirot shrugged his shoulders . “ i wondered . that is all . will you come in ? ”
christie	styles	we had reached the cottage . “ no . i think i ’ ll be getting back . i shall go round the long way through the woods. ” the woods round styles were very beautiful . after the walk across the open park , it was pleasant to saunter lazily through the cool glades . there was hardly a breath of wind , the very chirp of the birds was faint and subdued . i strolled on a little way , and finally flung myself down at the foot of a grand old beech-tree . my thoughts of mankind were kindly and charitable . i even forgave poirot for his absurd secrecy . in fact , i was at peace with the world . then i yawned .
christie	styles	i thought about the crime , and it struck me as being very unreal and far off . i yawned again . probably , i thought , it really never happened . of course , it was all a bad dream . the truth of the matter was that it was lawrence who had murdered alfred inglethorp with a croquet mallet . but it was absurd of john to make such a fuss about it , and to go shouting out : “ i tell you i won ’ t have it ! ”
christie	styles	i woke up with a start . at once i realized that i was in a very awkward predicament . for , about twelve feet away from me , john and mary cavendish were standing facing each other , and they were evidently quarrelling . and , quite as evidently , they were unaware of my vicinity , for before i could move or speak john repeated the words which had aroused me from my dream .
christie	styles	“ i tell you , mary , i won ’ t have it. ” mary ’ s voice came , cool and liquid : “ have _you_ any right to criticize my actions ? ” “ it will be the talk of the village ! my mother was only buried on saturday , and here you are gadding about with the fellow . ”
christie	styles	“ oh , ” she shrugged her shoulders , “ if it is only village gossip that you mind ! ” “ but it isn ’ t . i ’ ve had enough of the fellow hanging about . he ’ s a polish jew , anyway . ”
christie	styles	“ a tinge of jewish blood is not a bad thing . it leavens the ” —she looked at him— “ stolid stupidity of the ordinary englishman. ” fire in her eyes , ice in her voice . i did not wonder that the blood rose to john ’ s face in a crimson tide .
christie	styles	“ mary ! ” “ well ? ” her tone did not change . the pleading died out of his voice . “ am i to understand that you will continue to see bauerstein against my express wishes ? ” “ if i choose . ”
christie	styles	“ you defy me ? ” “ no , but i deny your right to criticize my actions . have _you_ no friends of whom i should disapprove ? ” john fell back a pace . the colour ebbed slowly from his face .
christie	styles	“ what do you mean ? ” he said , in an unsteady voice . “ you see ! ” said mary quietly . “ you _do_ see , don ’ t you , that _you_ have no right to dictate to _me_ as to the choice of my friends ? ”
christie	styles	john glanced at her pleadingly , a stricken look on his face . “ no right ? have i _no_ right , mary ? ” he said unsteadily . he stretched out his hands . “ mary—— ” for a moment , i thought she wavered . a softer expression came over her face , then suddenly she turned almost fiercely away .
christie	styles	“ none ! ” she was walking away when john sprang after her , and caught her by the arm . “ mary ” —his voice was very quiet now— “ are you in love with this fellow bauerstein ? ” she hesitated , and suddenly there swept across her face a strange expression , old as the hills , yet with something eternally young about it . so might some egyptian sphinx have smiled .
christie	styles	she freed herself quietly from his arm , and spoke over her shoulder . “ perhaps , ” she said ; and then swiftly passed out of the little glade , leaving john standing there as though he had been turned to stone .
christie	styles	rather ostentatiously , i stepped forward , crackling some dead branches with my feet as i did so . john turned . luckily , he took it for granted that i had only just come upon the scene .
christie	styles	“ hullo , hastings . have you seen the little fellow safely back to his cottage ? quaint little chap ! is he any good , though , really ? ” “ he was considered one of the finest detectives of his day . ”
christie	styles	“ oh , well , i suppose there must be something in it , then . what a rotten world it is , though ! ” “ you find it so ? ” i asked . “ good lord , yes ! there ’ s this terrible business to start with . scotland yard men in and out of the house like a jack-in-the-box ! never know where they won ’ t turn up next . screaming headlines in every paper in the country—damn all journalists , i say ! do you know there was a whole crowd staring in at the lodge gates this morning . sort of madame tussaud ’ s chamber of horrors business that can be seen for nothing . pretty thick , isn ’ t it ? ”
christie	styles	“ cheer up , john ! ” i said soothingly . “ it can ’ t last for ever. ” “ can ’ t it , though ? it can last long enough for us never to be able to hold up our heads again . ”
christie	styles	“ no , no , you ’ re getting morbid on the subject. ” “ enough to make a man morbid , to be stalked by beastly journalists and stared at by gaping moon-faced idiots , wherever he goes ! but there ’ s worse than that . ”
christie	styles	“ what ? ” john lowered his voice : “ have you ever thought , hastings—it ’ s a nightmare to me—who did it ? i can ’ t help feeling sometimes it must have been an accident . because—because—who could have done it ? now inglethorp ’ s out of the way , there ’ s no one else ; no one , i mean , except—one of us . ”
christie	styles	yes , indeed , that was nightmare enough for any man ! one of us ? yes , surely it must be so , unless——- a new idea suggested itself to my mind . rapidly , i considered it . the light increased . poirot ’ s mysterious doings , his hints—they all fitted in . fool that i was not to have thought of this possibility before , and what a relief for us all .
christie	styles	“ no , john , ” i said , “ it isn ’ t one of us . how could it be ? ” “ i know , but , still , who else is there ? ” “ can ’ t you guess ? ” “ no. ” i looked cautiously round , and lowered my voice .
christie	styles	“ dr . bauerstein ! ” i whispered . “ impossible ! ” “ not at all. ” “ but what earthly interest could he have in my mother ’ s death ? ” “ that i don ’ t see , ” i confessed , “ but i ’ ll tell you this : poirot thinks so . ”
christie	styles	“ poirot ? does he ? how do you know ? ” i told him of poirot ’ s intense excitement on hearing that dr. bauerstein had been at styles on the fatal night , and added : “ he said twice : ‘ that alters everything. ’ and i ’ ve been thinking . you know inglethorp said he had put down the coffee in the hall ? well , it was just then that bauerstein arrived . isn ’ t it possible that , as inglethorp brought him through the hall , the doctor dropped something into the coffee in passing ? ”
christie	styles	“ h ’ m , ” said john . “ it would have been very risky. ” “ yes , but it was possible. ” “ and then , how could he know it was her coffee ? no , old fellow , i don ’ t think that will wash . ”
christie	styles	but i had remembered something else . “ you ’ re quite right . that wasn ’ t how it was done . listen. ” and i then told him of the cocoa sample which poirot had taken to be analysed .
christie	styles	john interrupted just as i had done . “ but , look here , bauerstein had had it analysed already ? ” “ yes , yes , that ’ s the point . i didn ’ t see it either until now . don ’ t you understand ? bauerstein had it analysed—that ’ s just it ! if bauerstein ’ s the murderer , nothing could be simpler than for him to substitute some ordinary cocoa for his sample , and send that to be tested . and of course they would find no strychnine ! but no one would dream of suspecting bauerstein , or think of taking another sample—except poirot , ” i added , with belated recognition .
christie	styles	“ yes , but what about the bitter taste that cocoa won ’ t disguise ? ” “ well , we ’ ve only his word for that . and there are other possibilities . he ’ s admittedly one of the world ’ s greatest toxicologists—— ”
christie	styles	“ one of the world ’ s greatest what ? say it again. ” “ he knows more about poisons than almost anybody , ” i explained . “ well , my idea is , that perhaps he ’ s found some way of making strychnine tasteless . or it may not have been strychnine at all , but some obscure drug no one has ever heard of , which produces much the same symptoms . ”
christie	styles	“ h ’ m , yes , that might be , ” said john . “ but look here , how could he have got at the cocoa ? that wasn ’ t downstairs ? ” “ no , it wasn ’ t , ” i admitted reluctantly . and then , suddenly , a dreadful possibility flashed through my mind . i hoped and prayed it would not occur to john also . i glanced sideways at him . he was frowning perplexedly , and i drew a deep breath of relief , for the terrible thought that had flashed across my mind was this : that dr. bauerstein might have had an accomplice .
christie	styles	yet surely it could not be ! surely no woman as beautiful as mary cavendish could be a murderess . yet beautiful women had been known to poison . and suddenly i remembered that first conversation at tea on the day of my arrival , and the gleam in her eyes as she had said that poison was a woman ’ s weapon . how agitated she had been on that fatal tuesday evening ! had mrs. inglethorp discovered something between her and bauerstein , and threatened to tell her husband ? was it to stop that denunciation that the crime had been committed ?
christie	styles	then i remembered that enigmatical conversation between poirot and evelyn howard . was this what they had meant ? was this the monstrous possibility that evelyn had tried not to believe ? yes , it all fitted in .
christie	styles	no wonder miss howard had suggested “ hushing it up. ” now i understood that unfinished sentence of hers : “ emily herself—— ” and in my heart i agreed with her . would not mrs. inglethorp have preferred to go unavenged rather than have such terrible dishonour fall upon the name of cavendish .
christie	styles	“ there ’ s another thing , ” said john suddenly , and the unexpected sound of his voice made me start guiltily . “ something which makes me doubt if what you say can be true. ” “ what ’ s that ? ” i asked , thankful that he had gone away from the subject of how the poison could have been introduced into the cocoa .
christie	styles	“ why , the fact that bauerstein demanded a post-mortem . he needn ’ t have done so . little wilkins would have been quite content to let it go at heart disease. ” “ yes , ” i said doubtfully . “ but we don ’ t know . perhaps he thought it safer in the long run . someone might have talked afterwards . then the home office might have ordered exhumation . the whole thing would have come out , then , and he would have been in an awkward position , for no one would have believed that a man of his reputation could have been deceived into calling it heart disease . ”
christie	styles	“ yes , that ’ s possible , ” admitted john . “ still , ” he added , “ i ’ m blest if i can see what his motive could have been. ” i trembled . “ look here , ” i said , “ i may be altogether wrong . and , remember , all this is in confidence . ”
christie	styles	“ oh , of course—that goes without saying. ” we had walked , as we talked , and now we passed through the little gate into the garden . voices rose near at hand , for tea was spread out under the sycamore-tree , as it had been on the day of my arrival .
christie	styles	cynthia was back from the hospital , and i placed my chair beside her , and told her of poirot ’ s wish to visit the dispensary . “ of course ! i ’ d love him to see it . he ’ d better come to tea there one day . i must fix it up with him . he ’ s such a dear little man ! but he _is_ funny . he made me take the brooch out of my tie the other day , and put it in again , because he said it wasn ’ t straight . ”
christie	styles	i laughed . “ it ’ s quite a mania with him. ” “ yes , isn ’ t it ? ” we were silent for a minute or two , and then , glancing in the direction of mary cavendish , and dropping her voice , cynthia said :
christie	styles	“ mr . hastings. ” “ yes ? ” “ after tea , i want to talk to you. ” her glance at mary had set me thinking . i fancied that between these two there existed very little sympathy . for the first time , it occurred to me to wonder about the girl ’ s future . mrs. inglethorp had made no provisions of any kind for her , but i imagined that john and mary would probably insist on her making her home with them—at any rate until the end of the war . john , i knew , was very fond of her , and would be sorry to let her go .
christie	styles	john , who had gone into the house , now reappeared . his good-natured face wore an unaccustomed frown of anger . “ confound those detectives ! i can ’ t think what they ’ re after ! they ’ ve been in every room in the house—turning things inside out , and upside down . it really is too bad ! i suppose they took advantage of our all being out . i shall go for that fellow japp , when i next see him ! ”
christie	styles	“ lot of paul prys , ” grunted miss howard . lawrence opined that they had to make a show of doing something . mary cavendish said nothing . after tea , i invited cynthia to come for a walk , and we sauntered off into the woods together .
melville	moby	after supper , and another social chat and smoke , we went to our room together . he made me a present of his embalmed head ; took out his enormous tobacco wallet , and groping under the tobacco , drew out some thirty dollars in silver ; then spreading them on the table , and mechanically dividing them into two equal portions , pushed one of them towards me , and said it was mine . i was going to remonstrate ; but he silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers ’ pockets . i let them stay . he then went about his evening prayers , took out his idol , and removed the paper fireboard . by certain signs and symptoms , i thought he seemed anxious for me to join him ; but well knowing what was to follow , i deliberated a moment whether , in case he invited me , i would comply or otherwise .
melville	moby	walking the deck with quick , side-lunging strides , ahab commanded the t ’ gallant sails and royals to be set , and every stunsail spread . the best man in the ship must take the helm . then , with every mast-head manned , the piled-up craft rolled down before the wind . the strange , upheaving , lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows of so many sails , made the buoyant , hovering deck to feel like air beneath the feet ; while still she rushed along , as if two antagonistic influences were struggling in her—one to mount direct to heaven , the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal . and had you watched ahab ’ s face that night , you would have thought that in him also two different things were warring . while his one live leg made lively echoes along the deck , every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a coffin-tap . on life and death this old man walked . but though the ship so swiftly sped , and though from every eye , like arrows , the eager glances shot , yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night . every sailor swore he saw it once , but not a second time .
melville	moby	at the time , i devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this beer , beef , and bread , during which many profound thoughts were incidentally suggested to me , capable of a transcendental and platonic application ; and , furthermore , i compiled supplementary tables of my own , touching the probable quantity of stock-fish , etc. , consumed by every low dutch harpooneer in that ancient greenland and spitzbergen whale fishery . in the first place , the amount of butter , and texel and leyden cheese consumed , seems amazing . i impute it , though , to their naturally unctuous natures , being rendered still more unctuous by the nature of their vocation , and especially by their pursuing their game in those frigid polar seas , on the very coasts of that esquimaux country where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil .
melville	moby	“ cook , ” cried stubb , collaring him , “ i won ’ t have that swearing . talk to ’ em gentlemanly. ” once more the sermon proceeded . “ your woraciousness , fellow-critters , i don ’ t blame ye so much for ; dat is natur , and can ’ t be helped ; but to gobern dat wicked natur , dat is de pint . you is sharks , sartin ; but if you gobern de shark in you , why den you be angel ; for all angel is not ’ ing more dan de shark well goberned . now , look here , bred ’ ren , just try wonst to be cibil , a helping yourselbs from dat whale . don ’ t be tearin ’ de blubber out your neighbour ’ s mout , i say . is not one shark dood right as toder to dat whale ? and , by gor , none on you has de right to dat whale ; dat whale belong to some one else . i know some o ’ you has berry brig mout , brigger dan oders ; but den de brig mouts sometimes has de small bellies ; so dat de brigness of de mout is not to swaller wid , but to bit off de blubber for de small fry ob sharks , dat can ’ t get into de scrouge to help demselves . ”
melville	moby	all whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances , originally invented by the nantucket indians , called druggs . two thick squares of wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together , so that they cross each other ’ s grain at right angles ; a line of considerable length is then attached to the middle of this block , and the other end of the line being looped , it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon . it is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used . for then , more whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time . but sperm whales are not every day encountered ; while you may , then , you must kill all you can . and if you can not kill them all at once , you must wing them , so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure . hence it is , that at times like these the drugg , comes into requisition . our boat was furnished with three of them . the first and second were successfully darted , and we saw the whales staggeringly running off , fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg . they were cramped like malefactors with the chain and ball . but upon flinging the third , in the act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block , it caught under one of the seats of the boat , and in an instant tore it out and carried it away , dropping the oarsman in the boat ’ s bottom as the seat slid from under him . on both sides the sea came in at the wounded planks , but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in , and so stopped the leaks for the time .
melville	moby	but were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance , the complete abasement of poor starbuck ’ s fortitude , scarce might i have the heart to write it ; for it is a thing most sorrowful , nay shocking , to expose the fall of valour in the soul . men may seem detestable as joint stock-companies and nations ; knaves , fools , and murderers there may be ; men may have mean and meagre faces ; but man , in the ideal , is so noble and so sparkling , such a grand and glowing creature , that over any ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their costliest robes . that immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves , so far within us , that it remains intact though all the outer character seem gone ; bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a valor-ruined man . nor can piety itself , at such a shameful sight , completely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars . but this august dignity i treat of , is not the dignity of kings and robes , but that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture . thou shalt see it shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike ; that democratic dignity which , on all hands , radiates without end from god ; himself ! the great god absolute ! the centre and circumference of all democracy ! his omnipresence , our divine equality !
melville	moby	so down we went into the cabin , and to my great joy queequeg was soon enrolled among the same ship ’ s company to which i myself belonged . when all preliminaries were over and peleg had got everything ready for signing , he turned to me and said , “ i guess , quohog there don ’ t know how to write , does he ? i say , quohog , blast ye ! dost thou sign thy name or make thy mark ? ”
melville	moby	* * * * * * beyond the duodecimo , this system does not proceed , inasmuch as the porpoise is the smallest of the whales . above , you have all the leviathans of note . but there are a rabble of uncertain , fugitive , half-fabulous whales , which , as an american whaleman , i know by reputation , but not personally . i shall enumerate them by their fore-castle appellations ; for possibly such a list may be valuable to future investigators , who may complete what i have here but begun . if any of the following whales , shall hereafter be caught and marked , then he can readily be incorporated into this system , according to his folio , octavo , or duodecimo magnitude : —the bottle-nose whale ; the junk whale ; the pudding-headed whale ; the cape whale ; the leading whale ; the cannon whale ; the scragg whale ; the coppered whale ; the elephant whale ; the iceberg whale ; the quog whale ; the blue whale ; etc . from icelandic , dutch , and old english authorities , there might be quoted other lists of uncertain whales , blessed with all manner of uncouth names . but i omit them as altogether obsolete ; and can hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds , full of leviathanism , but signifying nothing .
melville	moby	perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those repeated whaling disasters—some few of which are casually chronicled—of this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line , and lost . for , when the line is darting out , to be seated then in the boat , is like being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a steam-engine in full play , when every flying beam , and shaft , and wheel , is grazing you . it is worse ; for you can not sit motionless in the heart of these perils , because the boat is rocking like a cradle , and you are pitched one way and the other , without the slightest warning ; and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of volition and action , can you escape being made a mazeppa of , and run away with where the all-seeing sun himself could never pierce you out .
melville	moby	“ have to burst it open , ” said i , and was running down the entry a little , for a good start , when the landlady caught at me , again vowing i should not break down her premises ; but i tore from her , and with a sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark .
melville	moby	“ forward , there ! heave the log ! ” two seamen came . the golden-hued tahitian and the grizzly manxman . “ take the reel , one of ye , i ’ ll heave. ” they went towards the extreme stern , on the ship ’ s lee side , where the deck , with the oblique energy of the wind , was now almost dipping into the creamy , sidelong-rushing sea .
melville	moby	but soon resuming his horizontal attitude , moby dick swam swiftly round and round the wrecked crew ; sideways churning the water in his vengeful wake , as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault . the sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him , as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before antiochus ’ s elephants in the book of maccabees . meanwhile ahab half smothered in the foam of the whale ’ s insolent tail , and too much of a cripple to swim , —though he could still keep afloat , even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that ; helpless ahab ’ s head was seen , like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock might burst . from the boat ’ s fragmentary stern , fedallah incuriously and mildly eyed him ; the clinging crew , at the other drifting end , could not succor him ; more than enough was it for them to look to themselves . for so revolvingly appalling was the white whale ’ s aspect , and so planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made , that he seemed horizontally swooping upon them . and though the other boats , unharmed , still hovered hard by ; still they dared not pull into the eddy to strike , lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of the jeopardized castaways , ahab and all ; nor in that case could they themselves hope to escape . with straining eyes , then , they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone , whose centre had now become the old man ’ s head .
melville	moby	“ don ’ t be afraid now , ” said he , grinning again , “ queequeg here wouldn ’ t harm a hair of your head. ” “ stop your grinning , ” shouted i , “ and why didn ’ t you tell me that that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal ? ”
melville	moby	it is well to parenthesize here , that of the fatal accidents in the sperm-whale fishery , this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any . sometimes , nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated ; oftener the boat ’ s bow is knocked off , or the thigh-board , in which the headsman stands , is torn from its place and accompanies the body . but strangest of all is the circumstance , that in more instances than one , when the body has been recovered , not a single mark of violence is discernible ; the man being stark dead .
melville	moby	as with the hawaiian savage , so with the white sailor-savage . with the same marvellous patience , and with the same single shark ’ s tooth , of his one poor jack-knife , he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture , not quite as workmanlike , but as close packed in its maziness of design , as the greek savage , achilles ’ s shield ; and full of barbaric spirit and suggestiveness , as the prints of that fine old dutch savage , albert durer .
melville	moby	“ and now the time of tide has come ; the ship casts off her cables ; and from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for tarshish , all careening , glides to sea . that ship , my friends , was the first of recorded smugglers ! the contraband was jonah . but the sea rebels ; he will not bear the wicked burden . a dreadful storm comes on , the ship is like to break . but now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her ; when boxes , bales , and jars are clattering overboard ; when the wind is shrieking , and the men are yelling , and every plank thunders with trampling feet right over jonah ’ s head ; in all this raging tumult , jonah sleeps his hideous sleep . he sees no black sky and raging sea , feels not the reeling timbers , and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale , which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after him . aye , shipmates , jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship—a berth in the cabin as i have taken it , and was fast asleep . but the frightened master comes to him , and shrieks in his dead ear , ‘ what meanest thou , o , sleeper ! arise ! ’ startled from his lethargy by that direful cry , jonah staggers to his feet , and stumbling to the deck , grasps a shroud , to look out upon the sea . but at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks . wave after wave thus leaps into the ship , and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft , till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat . and ever , as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead , aghast jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward , but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep .
melville	moby	“ i will bet something now , ” said stubb , “ that somewhere hereabouts are some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day . i thought they would keel up before long. ” presently , the vapors in advance slid aside ; and there in the distance lay a ship , whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be alongside . as we glided nearer , the stranger showed french colours from his peak ; and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that circled , and hovered , and swooped around him , it was plain that the whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale , that is , a whale that has died unmolested on the sea , and so floated an unappropriated corpse . it may well be conceived , what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale ; worse than an assyrian city in the plague , when the living are incompetent to bury the departed . so intolerable indeed is it regarded by some , that no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it . yet are there those who will still do it ; notwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality , and by no means of the nature of attar-of-rose .
melville	moby	but what most puzzled and confounded you was a long , limber , portentous , black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three blue , dim , perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast . a boggy , soggy , squitchy picture truly , enough to drive a nervous man distracted . yet was there a sort of indefinite , half-attained , unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it , till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant . ever and anon a bright , but , alas , deceptive idea would dart you through.—it ’ s the black sea in a midnight gale.—it ’ s the unnatural combat of the four primal elements.—it ’ s a blasted heath.—it ’ s a hyperborean winter scene.—it ’ s the breaking-up of the icebound stream of time . but at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in the picture ’ s midst . _that_ once found out , and all the rest were plain . but stop ; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish ? even the great leviathan himself ?
melville	moby	but if , in the face of all this , you still declare that whaling has no æsthetically noble associations connected with it , then am i ready to shiver fifty lances with you there , and unhorse you with a split helmet every time .
melville	moby	here then , from three impartial witnesses , i had a deliberate statement of the entire case . considering , therefore , that squalls and capsizings in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep , were matters of common occurrence in this kind of life ; considering that at the superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale i must resign my life into the hands of him who steered the boat—oftentimes a fellow who at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of scuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings ; considering that the particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed to starbuck ’ s driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall , and considering that starbuck , notwithstanding , was famous for his great heedfulness in the fishery ; considering that i belonged to this uncommonly prudent starbuck ’ s boat ; and finally considering in what a devil ’ s chase i was implicated , touching the white whale : taking all things together , i say , i thought i might as well go below and make a rough draft of my will . “ queequeg , ” said i , “ come along , you shall be my lawyer , executor , and legatee . ”
melville	moby	“ dost thee ? ” said bildad , in a hollow tone , and turning round to me . “ i _dost_ , ” said i unconsciously , he was so intense a quaker . “ what do ye think of him , bildad ? ” said peleg .
melville	moby	the manxman took the reel , and holding it high up , by the projecting handle-ends of the spindle , round which the spool of line revolved , so stood with the angular log hanging downwards , till ahab advanced to him .
melville	moby	so powerfully did the whole grim aspect of ahab affect me , and the livid brand which streaked it , that for the first few moments i hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood . it had previously come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of the sperm whale ’ s jaw . “ aye , he was dismasted off japan , ” said the old gay-head indian once ; “ but like his dismasted craft , he shipped another mast without coming home for it . he has a quiver of ’ em . ”
melville	moby	for the long absent ship , the outward-bounder , perhaps , has letters on board ; at any rate , she will be sure to let her have some papers of a date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and thumb-worn files . and in return for that courtesy , the outward-bound ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the cruising-ground to which she may be destined , a thing of the utmost importance to her . and in degree , all this will hold true concerning whaling vessels crossing each other ’ s track on the cruising-ground itself , even though they are equally long absent from home . for one of them may have received a transfer of letters from some third , and now far remote vessel ; and some of those letters may be for the people of the ship she now meets . besides , they would exchange the whaling news , and have an agreeable chat . for not only would they meet with all the sympathies of sailors , but likewise with all the peculiar congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared privations and perils .
melville	moby	“ get along with ye , ” said she to the man , “ or i ’ ll be combing ye ! ” “ come on , queequeg , ” said i , “ all right . there ’ s mrs. hussey. ” and so it turned out ; mr. hosea hussey being from home , but leaving mrs. hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs . upon making known our desires for a supper and a bed , mrs. hussey , postponing further scolding for the present , ushered us into a little room , and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded repast , turned round to us and said— “ clam or cod ? ”
melville	moby	gurry , so called , is a term properly belonging to right whalemen , but sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen . it designates the dark , glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the greenland or right whale , and much of which covers the decks of those inferior souls who hunt that ignoble leviathan .
melville	moby	you could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore . this young fellow ’ s healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue , and would seem to smell almost as musky ; he can not have been three days landed from his indian voyage . that man next him looks a few shades lighter ; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him . in the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn , but slightly bleached withal ; _he_ doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore . but who could show a cheek like queequeg ? which , barred with various tints , seemed like the andes ’ western slope , to show forth in one array , contrasting climates , zone by zone .
melville	moby	abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors , as this was said ; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic might follow . but starbuck looked away . with a blow from the top-maul ahab knocked off the steel head of the lance , and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining , bade him hold it upright , without its touching the deck . then , with the maul , after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod , he placed the blunted needle endwise on the top of it , and less strongly hammered that , several times , the mate still holding the rod as before . then going through some small strange motions with it—whether indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel , or merely intended to augment the awe of the crew , is uncertain—he called for linen thread ; and moving to the binnacle , slipped out the two reversed needles there , and horizontally suspended the sail-needle by its middle , over one of the compass-cards . at first , the steel went round and round , quivering and vibrating at either end ; but at last it settled to its place , when ahab , who had been intently watching for this result , stepped frankly back from the binnacle , and pointing his stretched arm towards it , exclaimed , — “ look ye , for yourselves , if ahab be not lord of the level loadstone ! the sun is east , and that compass swears it ! ”
melville	moby	consider the subtleness of the sea ; how its most dreaded creatures glide under water , unapparent for the most part , and treacherously hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure . consider also the devilish brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes , as the dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks . consider , once more , the universal cannibalism of the sea ; all whose creatures prey upon each other , carrying on eternal war since the world began .
melville	moby	“ i thought ye know ’ d it ; —didn ’ t i tell ye , he was a peddlin ’ heads around town ? —but turn flukes again and go to sleep . queequeg , look here—you sabbee me , i sabbee—you this man sleepe you—you sabbee ? ”
melville	moby	“ not forged ! ” and snatching perth ’ s levelled iron from the crotch , ahab held it out , exclaiming— “ look ye , nantucketer ; here in this hand i hold his death ! tempered in blood , and tempered by lightning are these barbs ; and i swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the fin , where the white whale most feels his accursed life ! ”
melville	moby	chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself . such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity . then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk ; the undeliverable , nameless perils of the whale ; these , with all the attending marvels of a thousand patagonian sights and sounds , helped to sway me to my wish . with other men , perhaps , such things would not have been inducements ; but as for me , i am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote . i love to sail forbidden seas , and land on barbarous coasts . not ignoring what is good , i am quick to perceive a horror , and could still be social with it—would they let me—since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in .
melville	moby	while daggoo and queequeg were stopping the strained planks ; and as the whale swimming out from them , turned , and showed one entire flank as he shot by them again ; at that moment a quick cry went up . lashed round and round to the fish ’ s back ; pinioned in the turns upon turns in which , during the past night , the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines around him , the half torn body of the parsee was seen ; his sable raiment frayed to shreds ; his distended eyes turned full upon old ahab .
melville	moby	nor with the immemorial superstition of their race , and in accordance with the preternaturalness , as it seemed , which in many things invested the pequod , were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that whenever and wherever descried ; at however remote times , or in however far apart latitudes and longitudes , that unnearable spout was cast by one self-same whale ; and that whale , moby dick . for a time , there reigned , too , a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition , as if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on , in order that the monster might turn round upon us , and rend us at last in the remotest and most savage seas .
melville	moby	“ immense as whales , the motion of whose vast bodies can in a peaceful calm trouble the ocean till it boil. ” —_sir william davenant . preface to gondibert_ . “ what spermacetti is , men might justly doubt , since the learned hosmannus in his work of thirty years , saith plainly , _nescio quid sit_. ” —_sir t. browne . of sperma ceti and the sperma ceti whale . vide his v. e._
melville	moby	“ and now behold jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea ; when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east , and the sea is still , as jonah carries down the gale with him , leaving smooth water behind . he goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him ; and the whale shoots-to all his ivory teeth , like so many white bolts , upon his prison . then jonah prayed unto the lord out of the fish ’ s belly . but observe his prayer , and learn a weighty lesson . for sinful as he is , jonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance . he feels that his dreadful punishment is just . he leaves all his deliverance to god , contenting himself with this , that spite of all his pains and pangs , he will still look towards his holy temple . and here , shipmates , is true and faithful repentance ; not clamorous for pardon , but grateful for punishment . and how pleasing to god was this conduct in jonah , is shown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale . shipmates , i do not place jonah before you to be copied for his sin but i do place him before you as a model for repentance . sin not ; but if you do , take heed to repent of it like jonah . ”
melville	moby	coffin ? —spouter ? —rather ominous in that particular connexion , thought i . but it is a common name in nantucket , they say , and i suppose this peter here is an emigrant from there . as the light looked so dim , and the place , for the time , looked quiet enough , and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district , and as the swinging sign had a poverty-stricken sort of creak to it , i thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings , and the best of pea coffee .
melville	moby	all honor to the enderbies , therefore , whose house , i think , exists to the present day ; though doubtless the original samuel must long ago have slipped his cable for the great south sea of the other world .
melville	moby	chief among these latter was a great sperm whale , which , after an unusually long raging gale , had been found dead and stranded , with his head against a cocoa-nut tree , whose plumage-like , tufted droopings seemed his verdant jet . when the vast body had at last been stripped of its fathom-deep enfoldings , and the bones become dust dry in the sun , then the skeleton was carefully transported up the pupella glen , where a grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it .
melville	moby	but come out now , and look at this portentous lower jaw , which seems like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff-box , with the hinge at one end , instead of one side . if you pry it up , so as to get it overhead , and expose its rows of teeth , it seems a terrific portcullis ; and such , alas ! it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery , upon whom these spikes fall with impaling force . but far more terrible is it to behold , when fathoms down in the sea , you see some sulky whale , floating there suspended , with his prodigious jaw , some fifteen feet long , hanging straight down at right-angles with his body , for all the world like a ship ’ s jib-boom . this whale is not dead ; he is only dispirited ; out of sorts , perhaps ; hypochondriac ; and so supine , that the hinges of his jaw have relaxed , leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight , a reproach to all his tribe , who must , no doubt , imprecate lock-jaws upon him .
melville	moby	“ and did none of ye see it before ? ” cried ahab , hailing the perched men all around him . “ i saw him almost that same instant , sir , that captain ahab did , and i cried out , ” said tashtego .

melville	moby	with memories like these in him , and , moreover , given to a certain superstitiousness , as has been said ; the courage of this starbuck which could , nevertheless , still flourish , must indeed have been extreme . but it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized , and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as he had ; it was not in nature that these things should fail in latently engendering an element in him , which , under suitable circumstances , would break out from its confinement , and burn all his courage up . and brave as he might be , it was that sort of bravery chiefly , visible in some intrepid men , which , while generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas , or winds , or whales , or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world , yet can not withstand those more terrific , because more spiritual terrors , which sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man .
melville	moby	as , after this interlude , the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket of the whale , many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild affair . chapter 72 . the monkey-rope .
melville	moby	of late years the manilla rope has in the american fishery almost entirely superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines ; for , though not so durable as hemp , it is stronger , and far more soft and elastic ; and i will add ( since there is an æsthetics in all things ) , is much more handsome and becoming to the boat , than hemp . hemp is a dusky , dark fellow , a sort of indian ; but manilla is as a golden-haired circassian to behold .
melville	moby	“ ‘ damn your eyes ! what ’ s that pump stopping for ? ’ roared radney , pretending not to have heard the sailors ’ talk . ‘ thunder away at it ! ’ “ ‘ aye , aye , sir , ’ said steelkilt , merry as a cricket . ‘ lively , boys , lively , now ! ’ and with that the pump clanged like fifty fire-engines ; the men tossed their hats off to it , and ere long that peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life ’ s utmost energies .
melville	moby	this being told to queequeg , he at once complied , and again politely motioned me to get into bed—rolling over to one side as much as to say— “ i won ’ t touch a leg of ye . ”
melville	moby	as if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate , bildad , without noticing his present irreverence , quietly looked up , and seeing me , glanced again inquiringly towards peleg . “ he says he ’ s our man , bildad , ” said peleg , “ he wants to ship . ”
melville	moby	“ the ship ’ s company being reduced to but a handful , the captain called upon the islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving down the ship to stop the leak . but to such unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated , both by night and by day , and so extreme was the hard work they underwent , that upon the vessel being ready again for sea , they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel . after taking counsel with his officers , he anchored the ship as far off shore as possible ; loaded and ran out his two cannon from the bows ; stacked his muskets on the poop ; and warning the islanders not to approach the ship at their peril , took one man with him , and setting the sail of his best whale-boat , steered straight before the wind for tahiti , five hundred miles distant , to procure a reinforcement to his crew .
melville	moby	chapter 117 . the whale watch . the four whales slain that evening had died wide apart ; one , far to windward ; one , less distant , to leeward ; one ahead ; one astern . these last three were brought alongside ere nightfall ; but the windward one could not be reached till morning ; and the boat that had killed it lay by its side all night ; and that boat was ahab ’ s .

melville	moby	stripped to our shirts and drawers , we sprang to the white-ash , and after several hours ’ pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase , when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating token that they were now at last under the influence of that strange perplexity of inert irresolution , which , when the fishermen perceive it in the whale , they say he is gallied . the compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming , were now broken up in one measureless rout ; and like king porus ’ elephants in the indian battle with alexander , they seemed going mad with consternation . in all directions expanding in vast irregular circles , and aimlessly swimming hither and thither , by their short thick spoutings , they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic . this was still more strangely evinced by those of their number , who , completely paralysed as it were , helplessly floated like water-logged dismantled ships on the sea . had these leviathans been but a flock of simple sheep , pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves , they could not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay . but this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures . though banding together in tens of thousands , the lion-maned buffaloes of the west have fled before a solitary horseman . witness , too , all human beings , how when herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre ’ s pit , they will , at the slightest alarm of fire , rush helter-skelter for the outlets , crowding , trampling , jamming , and remorselessly dashing each other to death . best , therefore , withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales before us , for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men .
melville	moby	but courage ! there is good cheer in store for you , queequeg . for now , as with blue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at last climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over the side ; the steward advances , and with a benevolent , consolatory glance hands him—what ? some hot cognac ? no ! hands him , ye gods ! hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water !

melville	moby	chapter 17 . the ramadan . as queequeg ’ s ramadan , or fasting and humiliation , was to continue all day , i did not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall ; for i cherish the greatest respect towards everybody ’ s religious obligations , never mind how comical , and could not find it in my heart to undervalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad-stool ; or those other creatures in certain parts of our earth , who with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets , bow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name .

melville	moby	“ and thou mayest as well sign the papers right off , ” he added— “ come along with ye. ” and so saying , he led the way below deck into the cabin . seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure . it turned out to be captain bildad , who along with captain peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel ; the other shares , as is sometimes the case in these ports , being held by a crowd of old annuitants ; widows , fatherless children , and chancery wards ; each owning about the value of a timber head , or a foot of plank , or a nail or two in the ship . people in nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels , the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest .

melville	moby	though in many natural objects , whiteness refiningly enhances beauty , as if imparting some special virtue of its own , as in marbles , japonicas , and pearls ; and though various nations have in some way recognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue ; even the barbaric , grand old kings of pegu placing the title “ lord of the white elephants ” above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion ; and the modern kings of siam unfurling the same snow-white quadruped in the royal standard ; and the hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snow-white charger ; and the great austrian empire , cæsarian , heir to overlording rome , having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue ; and though this pre-eminence in it applies to the human race itself , giving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe ; and though , besides , all this , whiteness has been even made significant of gladness , for among the romans a white stone marked a joyful day ; and though in other mortal sympathies and symbolizings , this same hue is made the emblem of many touching , noble things—the innocence of brides , the benignity of age ; though among the red men of america the giving of the white belt of wampum was the deepest pledge of honor ; though in many climes , whiteness typifies the majesty of justice in the ermine of the judge , and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by milk-white steeds ; though even in the higher mysteries of the most august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness and power ; by the persian fire worshippers , the white forked flame being held the holiest on the altar ; and in the greek mythologies , great jove himself being made incarnate in a snow-white bull ; and though to the noble iroquois , the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred white dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology , that spotless , faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could send to the great spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity ; and though directly from the latin word for white , all christian priests derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture , the alb or tunic , worn beneath the cassock ; and though among the holy pomps of the romish faith , white is specially employed in the celebration of the passion of our lord ; though in the vision of st. john , white robes are given to the redeemed , and the four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white before the great white throne , and the holy one that sitteth there white like wool ; yet for all these accumulated associations , with whatever is sweet , and honorable , and sublime , there yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue , which strikes more of panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood .
melville	moby	“ that sea beast leviathan , which god of all his works created hugest that swim the ocean stream. ” —_paradise lost_ . — “ there leviathan , hugest of living creatures , in the deep stretched like a promontory sleeps or swims , and seems a moving land ; and at his gills draws in , and at his breath spouts out a sea. ” —_ibid_ .
melville	moby	now , the spouting canal of the sperm whale , chiefly intended as it is for the conveyance of air , and for several feet laid along , horizontally , just beneath the upper surface of his head , and a little to one side ; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down in a city on one side of a street . but the question returns whether this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe ; in other words , whether the spout of the sperm whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath , or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth , and discharged through the spiracle . it is certain that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal ; but it can not be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle . because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be , when in feeding he accidentally takes in water . but the sperm whale ’ s food is far beneath the surface , and there he can not spout even if he would . besides , if you regard him very closely , and time him with your watch , you will find that when unmolested , there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration .

melville	moby	chapter 10 . a bosom friend . returning to the spouter-inn from the chapel , i found queequeg there quite alone ; he having left the chapel before the benediction some time . he was sitting on a bench before the fire , with his feet on the stove hearth , and in one hand was holding close up to his face that little negro idol of his ; peering hard into its face , and with a jack-knife gently whittling away at its nose , meanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way .
melville	moby	coming still nearer with the expiring breeze , we saw that the frenchman had a second whale alongside ; and this second whale seemed even more of a nosegay than the first . in truth , it turned out to be one of those problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious dyspepsia , or indigestion ; leaving their defunct bodies almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil . nevertheless , in the proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale as this , however much he may shun blasted whales in general .
melville	moby	pulling an oar in the jeroboam ’ s boat , was a man of a singular appearance , even in that wild whaling life where individual notabilities make up all totalities . he was a small , short , youngish man , sprinkled all over his face with freckles , and wearing redundant yellow hair . a long-skirted , cabalistically-cut coat of a faded walnut tinge enveloped him ; the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists . a deep , settled , fanatic delirium was in his eyes .

melville	moby	“ lower away then ; d ’ ye hear ? ” shouting across the deck . “ lower away there , i say. ” such was the thunder of his voice , that spite of their amazement the men sprang over the rail ; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks ; with a wallow , the three boats dropped into the sea ; while , with a dexterous , off-handed daring , unknown in any other vocation , the sailors , goat-like , leaped down the rolling ship ’ s side into the tossed boats below .

melville	moby	but being now interrupted , he put up the image ; and pretty soon , going to the table , took up a large book there , and placing it on his lap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity ; at every fiftieth page—as i fancied—stopping a moment , looking vacantly around him , and giving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment . he would then begin again at the next fifty ; seeming to commence at number one each time , as though he could not count more than fifty , and it was only by such a large number of fifties being found together , that his astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited .
melville	moby	[ _sudden , repeated flashes of lightning ; the nine flames leap lengthwise to thrice their previous height ; ahab , with the rest , closes his eyes , his right hand pressed hard upon them._ ] “ i own thy speechless , placeless power ; said i not so ? nor was it wrung from me ; nor do i now drop these links . thou canst blind ; but i can then grope . thou canst consume ; but i can then be ashes . take the homage of these poor eyes , and shutter-hands . i would not take it . the lightning flashes through my skull ; mine eye-balls ache and ache ; my whole beaten brain seems as beheaded , and rolling on some stunning ground . oh , oh ! yet blindfold , yet will i talk to thee . light though thou be , thou leapest out of darkness ; but i am darkness leaping out of light , leaping out of thee ! the javelins cease ; open eyes ; see , or not ? there burn the flames ! oh , thou magnanimous ! now i do glory in my genealogy . but thou art but my fiery father ; my sweet mother , i know not . oh , cruel ! what hast thou done with her ? there lies my puzzle ; but thine is greater . thou knowest not how came ye , hence callest thyself unbegotten ; certainly knowest not thy beginning , hence callest thyself unbegun . i know that of me , which thou knowest not of thyself , oh , thou omnipotent . there is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee , thou clear spirit , to whom all thy eternity is but time , all thy creativeness mechanical . through thee , thy flaming self , my scorched eyes do dimly see it . oh , thou foundling fire , thou hermit immemorial , thou too hast thy incommunicable riddle , thy unparticipated grief . here again with haughty agony , i read my sire . leap ! leap up , and lick the sky ! i leap with thee ; i burn with thee ; would fain be welded with thee ; defyingly i worship thee ! ”
melville	moby	but this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more abbreviate it . in an instant ’ s compass , great hearts sometimes condense to one deep pang , the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused through feebler men ’ s whole lives . and so , such hearts , though summary in each one suffering ; still , if the gods decree it , in their life-time aggregate a whole age of woe , wholly made up of instantaneous intensities ; for even in their pointless centres , those noble natures contain the entire circumferences of inferior souls .

melville	moby	_ “ sweet fields beyond the swelling flood , stand dressed in living green . so to the jews old canaan stood , while jordan rolled between. ” _ never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then . they were full of hope and fruition . spite of this frigid winter night in the boisterous atlantic , spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket , there was yet , it then seemed to me , many a pleasant haven in store ; and meads and glades so eternally vernal , that the grass shot up by the spring , untrodden , unwilted , remains at midsummer .
melville	moby	let us , then , look at this matter , along with some interesting items contingent . every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills , the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is combined with the element in which they swim ; hence , a herring or a cod might live a century , and never once raise its head above the surface . but owing to his marked internal structure which gives him regular lungs , like a human being ’ s , the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere . wherefore the necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world . but he can not in any degree breathe through his mouth , for , in his ordinary attitude , the sperm whale ’ s mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the surface ; and what is still more , his windpipe has no connexion with his mouth . no , he breathes through his spiracle alone ; and this is on the top of his head .

melville	moby	i should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal , but can not , owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen , and which , in the estimation of some already biased minds , might be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said of the frenchman ’ s two whales . elsewhere in this volume the slanderous aspersion has been disproved , that the vocation of whaling is throughout a slatternly , untidy business . but there is another thing to rebut . they hint that all whales always smell bad . now how did this odious stigma originate ?
melville	moby	one of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long , keen weapon called a boarding-sword , and watching his chance he dexterously slices out a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass . into this hole , the end of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber , in order to prepare for what follows . whereupon , this accomplished swordsman , warning all hands to stand off , once more makes a scientific dash at the mass , and with a few sidelong , desperate , lunging slicings , severs it completely in twain ; so that while the short lower part is still fast , the long upper strip , called a blanket-piece , swings clear , and is all ready for lowering . the heavers forward now resume their song , and while the one tackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale , the other is slowly slackened away , and down goes the first strip through the main hatchway right beneath , into an unfurnished parlor called the blubber-room . into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long blanket-piece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents . and thus the work proceeds ; the two tackles hoisting and lowering simultaneously ; both whale and windlass heaving , the heavers singing , the blubber-room gentlemen coiling , the mates scarfing , the ship straining , and all hands swearing occasionally , by way of assuaging the general friction .

melville	moby	already several fatalities had attended his chase . but though similar disasters , however little bruited ashore , were by no means unusual in the fishery ; yet , in most instances , such seemed the white whale ’ s infernal aforethought of ferocity , that every dismembering or death that he caused , was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an unintelligent agent .

melville	moby	fourth : stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the middle of solitary seas , you find him unbent from the vast corpulence of his dignity , and kitten-like , he plays on the ocean as if it were a hearth . but still you see his power in his play . the broad palms of his tail are flirted high into the air ; then smiting the surface , the thunderous concussion resounds for miles . you would almost think a great gun had been discharged ; and if you noticed the light wreath of vapor from the spiracle at his other extremity , you would think that that was the smoke from the touch-hole .

melville	moby	nor is it , altogether , the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling earthquakes ; nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas ; nor the tearlessness of arid skies that never rain ; nor the sight of her wide field of leaning spires , wrenched cope-stones , and crosses all adroop ( like canted yards of anchored fleets ) ; and her suburban avenues of house-walls lying over upon each other , as a tossed pack of cards ; —it is not these things alone which make tearless lima , the strangest , saddest city thou can ’ st see . for lima has taken the white veil ; and there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe . old as pizarro , this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new ; admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay ; spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions .
melville	moby	and that same day , too , gazing far down from his boat ’ s side into that same golden sea , starbuck lowly murmured : — “ loveliness unfathomable , as ever lover saw in his young bride ’ s eye ! —tell me not of thy teeth-tiered sharks , and thy kidnapping cannibal ways . let faith oust fact ; let fancy oust memory ; i look deep down and do believe . ”
melville	moby	“ screwed at its axis against the side , a swinging lamp slightly oscillates in jonah ’ s room ; and the ship , heeling over towards the wharf with the weight of the last bales received , the lamp , flame and all , though in slight motion , still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the room ; though , in truth , infallibly straight itself , it but made obvious the false , lying levels among which it hung . the lamp alarms and frightens jonah ; as lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place , and this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance . but that contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him . the floor , the ceiling , and the side , are all awry . ‘ oh ! so my conscience hangs in me ! ’ he groans , ‘ straight upwards , so it burns ; but the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness ! ’
melville	moby	chapter 75 . the right whale ’ s head—contrasted view . crossing the deck , let us now have a good long look at the right whale ’ s head . as in general shape the noble sperm whale ’ s head may be compared to a roman war-chariot ( especially in front , where it is so broadly rounded ) ; so , at a broad view , the right whale ’ s head bears a rather inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe . two hundred years ago an old dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a shoemaker ’ s last . and in this same last or shoe , that old woman of the nursery tale , with the swarming brood , might very comfortably be lodged , she and all her progeny .

melville	moby	“ i have heard , ” murmured starbuck , gazing down the scuttle , “ that in violent fevers , men , all ignorance , have talked in ancient tongues ; and that when the mystery is probed , it turns out always that in their wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken in their hearing by some lofty scholars . so , to my fond faith , poor pip , in this strange sweetness of his lunacy , brings heavenly vouchers of all our heavenly homes . where learned he that , but there ? —hark ! he speaks again : but more wildly now . ”
melville	moby	“ there ’ s a pretty fellow , now , ” he banteringly laughed , standing in the ship ’ s bows , “ there ’ s a jackal for ye ! i well know that these crappoes of frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery ; sometimes lowering their boats for breakers , mistaking them for sperm whale spouts ; yes , and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of tallow candles , and cases of snuffers , foreseeing that all the oil they will get won ’ t be enough to dip the captain ’ s wick into ; aye , we all know these things ; but look ye , here ’ s a crappo that is content with our leavings , the drugged whale there , i mean ; aye , and is content too with scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there . poor devil ! i say , pass round a hat , some one , and let ’ s make him a present of a little oil for dear charity ’ s sake . for what oil he ’ ll get from that drugged whale there , wouldn ’ t be fit to burn in a jail ; no , not in a condemned cell . and as for the other whale , why , i ’ ll agree to get more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours , than he ’ ll get from that bundle of bones ; though , now that i think of it , it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil ; yes , ambergris . i wonder now if our old man has thought of that . it ’ s worth trying . yes , i ’ m for it ; ” and so saying he started for the quarter-deck .
melville	moby	in the first place , the enormous cutting tackles , among other ponderous things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green , and which no single man can possibly lift—this vast bunch of grapes was swayed up to the main-top and firmly lashed to the lower mast-head , the strongest point anywhere above a ship ’ s deck . the end of the hawser-like rope winding through these intricacies , was then conducted to the windlass , and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over the whale ; to this block the great blubber hook , weighing some one hundred pounds , was attached . and now suspended in stages over the side , starbuck and stubb , the mates , armed with their long spades , began cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of the hook just above the nearest of the two side-fins . this done , a broad , semicircular line is cut round the hole , the hook is inserted , and the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus , now commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass . when instantly , the entire ship careens over on her side ; every bolt in her starts like the nail-heads of an old house in frosty weather ; she trembles , quivers , and nods her frighted mast-heads to the sky . more and more she leans over to the whale , while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows ; till at last , a swift , startling snap is heard ; with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from the whale , and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber . now as the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange , so is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it . for the strain constantly kept up by the windlass continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the water , and as the blubber in one strip uniformly peels off along the line called the “ scarf , ” simultaneously cut by the spades of starbuck and stubb , the mates ; and just as fast as it is thus peeled off , and indeed by that very act itself , it is all the time being hoisted higher and higher aloft till its upper end grazes the main-top ; the men at the windlass then cease heaving , and for a moment or two the prodigious blood-dripping mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky , and every one present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings , else it may box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard .
melville	moby	but supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at the first rush of the harem ’ s lord , then is it very diverting to watch that lord . gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and revels there awhile , still in tantalizing vicinity to young lothario , like pious solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines . granting other whales to be in sight , the fishermen will seldom give chase to one of these grand turks ; for these grand turks are too lavish of their strength , and hence their unctuousness is small . as for the sons and the daughters they beget , why , those sons and daughters must take care of themselves ; at least , with only the maternal help . for like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named , my lord whale has no taste for the nursery , however much for the bower ; and so , being a great traveller , he leaves his anonymous babies all over the world ; every baby an exotic . in good time , nevertheless , as the ardour of youth declines ; as years and dumps increase ; as reflection lends her solemn pauses ; in short , as a general lassitude overtakes the sated turk ; then a love of ease and virtue supplants the love for maidens ; our ottoman enters upon the impotent , repentant , admonitory stage of life , forswears , disbands the harem , and grown to an exemplary , sulky old soul , goes about all alone among the meridians and parallels saying his prayers , and warning each young leviathan from his amorous errors .
melville	moby	and yet , somehow , did ahab—in his own proper self , as daily , hourly , and every instant , commandingly revealed to his subordinates , —ahab seemed an independent lord ; the parsee but his slave . still again both seemed yoked together , and an unseen tyrant driving them ; the lean shade siding the solid rib . for be this parsee what he may , all rib and keel was solid ahab .
melville	moby	now , mark . unerringly impelling this dead , impregnable , uninjurable wall , and this most buoyant thing within ; there swims behind it all a mass of tremendous life , only to be adequately estimated as piled wood is—by the cord ; and all obedient to one volition , as the smallest insect . so that when i shall hereafter detail to you all the specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this expansive monster ; when i shall show you some of his more inconsiderable braining feats ; i trust you will have renounced all ignorant incredulity , and be ready to abide by this ; that though the sperm whale stove a passage through the isthmus of darien , and mixed the atlantic with the pacific , you would not elevate one hair of your eye-brow . for unless you own the whale , you are but a provincial and sentimentalist in truth . but clear truth is a thing for salamander giants only to encounter ; how small the chances for the provincials then ? what befell the weakling youth lifting the dread goddess ’ s veil at lais ?
melville	moby	“ there , ” said the landlord , placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table ; “ there , make yourself comfortable now , and good night to ye. ” i turned round from eyeing the bed , but he had disappeared .

melville	moby	book iii . ( _duodecimo_ ) , chapter 1 . ( _huzza porpoise_ ) .—this is the common porpoise found almost all over the globe . the name is of my own bestowal ; for there are more than one sort of porpoises , and something must be done to distinguish them . i call him thus , because he always swims in hilarious shoals , which upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to heaven like caps in a fourth-of-july crowd . their appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner . full of fine spirits , they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward . they are the lads that always live before the wind . they are accounted a lucky omen . if you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish , then heaven help ye ; the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye . a well-fed , plump huzza porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil . but the fine and delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable . it is in request among jewellers and watchmakers . sailors put it on their hones . porpoise meat is good eating , you know . it may never have occurred to you that a porpoise spouts . indeed , his spout is so small that it is not very readily discernible . but the next time you have a chance , watch him ; and you will then see the great sperm whale himself in miniature .

melville	moby	chapter 65 . the whale as a dish . that mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp , and , like stubb , eat him by his own light , as you may say ; this seems so outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and philosophy of it .
melville	moby	“ why , blast your eyes , bildad , ” cried peleg , “ thou dost not want to swindle this young man ! he must have more than that. ” “ seven hundred and seventy-seventh , ” again said bildad , without lifting his eyes ; and then went on mumbling— “ for where your treasure is , there will your heart be also . ”
melville	moby	“ very good , then ; good bye now , and i ’ ll call again in a minute. ” then rapidly pulling back towards the pequod , and seeing ahab leaning over the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report , he moulded his two hands into a trumpet and shouted— “ no , sir ! no ! ” upon which ahab retired , and stubb returned to the frenchman .
melville	moby	now , by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis , its bow , by anticipation , was made to face the whale ’ s head while yet under water . but as if perceiving this stratagem , moby dick , with that malicious intelligence ascribed to him , sidelingly transplanted himself , as it were , in an instant , shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat .
melville	moby	the devil fetch that harpooneer , thought i , but stop , couldn ’ t i steal a march on him—bolt his door inside , and jump into his bed , not to be wakened by the most violent knockings ? it seemed no bad idea ; but upon second thoughts i dismissed it . for who could tell but what the next morning , so soon as i popped out of the room , the harpooneer might be standing in the entry , all ready to knock me down !
melville	moby	the opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears . some were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory saws ; others were tufted with knots of human hair ; and one was sickle-shaped , with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed mower . you shuddered as you gazed , and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking , horrifying implement . mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed . some were storied weapons . with this once long lance , now wildly elbowed , fifty years ago did nathan swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset . and that harpoon—so like a corkscrew now—was flung in javan seas , and run away with by a whale , years afterwards slain off the cape of blanco . the original iron entered nigh the tail , and , like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man , travelled full forty feet , and at last was found imbedded in the hump .
melville	moby	but be all this as it may , certain it is that while the subordinate phantoms soon found their place among the crew , though still as it were somehow distinct from them , yet that hair-turbaned fedallah remained a muffled mystery to the last . whence he came in a mannerly world like this , by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be linked with ahab ’ s peculiar fortunes ; nay , so far as to have some sort of a half-hinted influence ; heaven knows , but it might have been even authority over him ; all this none knew . but one can not sustain an indifferent air concerning fedallah . he was such a creature as civilized , domestic people in the temperate zone only see in their dreams , and that but dimly ; but the like of whom now and then glide among the unchanging asiatic communities , especially the oriental isles to the east of the continent—those insulated , immemorial , unalterable countries , which even in these modern days still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earth ’ s primal generations , when the memory of the first man was a distinct recollection , and all men his descendants , unknowing whence he came , eyed each other as real phantoms , and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and to what end ; when though , according to genesis , the angels indeed consorted with the daughters of men , the devils also , add the uncanonical rabbins , indulged in mundane amours .
melville	moby	during these days of preparation , queequeg and i often visited the craft , and as often i asked about captain ahab , and how he was , and when he was going to come on board his ship . to these questions they would answer , that he was getting better and better , and was expected aboard every day ; meantime , the two captains , peleg and bildad , could attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage . if i had been downright honest with myself , i would have seen very plainly in my heart that i did but half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage , without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute dictator of it , so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea . but when a man suspects any wrong , it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in the matter , he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself . and much this way it was with me . i said nothing , and tried to think nothing .
melville	moby	but being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple shirt , who was waiting for it in the entry , and seeming to hear nothing but the word “ clam , ” mrs. hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen , and bawling out “ clam for two , ” disappeared .

melville	moby	chapter 35 . the mast-head . it was during the more pleasant weather , that in due rotation with the other seamen my first mast-head came round . in most american whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost simultaneously with the vessel ’ s leaving her port ; even though she may have fifteen thousand miles , and more , to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground . and if , after a three , four , or five years ’ voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her—say , an empty vial even—then , her mast-heads are kept manned to the last ; and not till her skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port , does she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more .
melville	moby	then turning—the last link held fast in his left hand , he put his foot upon the parsee ; and with fixed upward eye , and high-flung right arm , he stood erect before the lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames .
melville	moby	“ man overboard ! ” cried daggoo , who amid the general consternation first came to his senses . “ swing the bucket this way ! ” and putting one foot into it , so as the better to secure his slippery hand-hold on the whip itself , the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head , almost before tashtego could have reached its interior bottom . meantime , there was a terrible tumult . looking over the side , they saw the before lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea , as if that moment seized with some momentous idea ; whereas it was only the poor indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous depth to which he had sunk .
melville	moby	when serenely advancing on one of these journeys , if any strange suspicious sights are seen , my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his interesting family . should any unwarrantably pert young leviathan coming that way , presume to draw confidentially close to one of the ladies , with what prodigious fury the bashaw assails him , and chases him away ! high times , indeed , if unprincipled young rakes like him are to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss ; though do what the bashaw will , he can not keep the most notorious lothario out of his bed ; for , alas ! all fish bed in common . as ashore , the ladies often cause the most terrible duels among their rival admirers ; just so with the whales , who sometimes come to deadly battle , and all for love . they fence with their long lower jaws , sometimes locking them together , and so striving for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their antlers . not a few are captured having the deep scars of these encounters , —furrowed heads , broken teeth , scolloped fins ; and in some instances , wrenched and dislocated mouths .
melville	moby	* a little item may as well be related here . the strongest and most reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside , is by the flukes or tail ; and as from its greater density that part is relatively heavier than any other ( excepting the side-fins ) , its flexibility even in death , causes it to sink low beneath the surface ; so that with the hand you can not get at it from the boat , in order to put the chain round it . but this difficulty is ingeniously overcome : a small , strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end , and a weight in its middle , while the other end is secured to the ship . by adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side of the mass , so that now having girdled the whale , the chain is readily made to follow suit ; and being slipped along the body , is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail , at the point of junction with its broad flukes or lobes .
melville	moby	“ meantime , at the first tap of the boat ’ s bottom , the lakeman had slackened the line , so as to drop astern from the whirlpool ; calmly looking on , he thought his own thoughts . but a sudden , terrific , downward jerking of the boat , quickly brought his knife to the line . he cut it ; and the whale was free . but , at some distance , moby dick rose again , with some tatters of radney ’ s red woollen shirt , caught in the teeth that had destroyed him . all four boats gave chase again ; but the whale eluded them , and finally wholly disappeared .
melville	moby	holding by a shroud , starbuck was standing on the quarter-deck ; at every flash of the lightning glancing aloft , to see what additional disaster might have befallen the intricate hamper there ; while stubb and flask were directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer lashing of the boats . but all their pains seemed naught . though lifted to the very top of the cranes , the windward quarter boat ( ahab ’ s ) did not escape . a great rolling sea , dashing high up against the reeling ship ’ s high teetering side , stove in the boat ’ s bottom at the stern , and left it again , all dripping through like a sieve .
melville	moby	the pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger , that stubb vowed he recognised his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were knotted round the tail of one of these whales .
melville	moby	it was a terrific , most pitiable , and maddening sight . the whale was now going head out , and sending his spout before him in a continual tormented jet ; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of fright . now to this hand , now to that , he yawed in his faltering flight , and still at every billow that he broke , he spasmodically sank in the sea , or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin . so have i seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circles in the air , vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks . but the bird has a voice , and with plaintive cries will make known her fear ; but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea , was chained up and enchanted in him ; he had no voice , save that choking respiration through his spiracle , and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable ; while still , in his amazing bulk , portcullis jaw , and omnipotent tail , there was enough to appal the stoutest man who so pitied .
melville	moby	though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight , sharks will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship ’ s decks , like hungry dogs round a table where red meat is being carved , ready to bolt down every killed man that is tossed to them ; and though , while the valiant butchers over the deck-table are thus cannibally carving each other ’ s live meat with carving-knives all gilded and tasselled , the sharks , also , with their jewel-hilted mouths , are quarrelsomely carving away under the table at the dead meat ; and though , were you to turn the whole affair upside down , it would still be pretty much the same thing , that is to say , a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties ; and though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships crossing the atlantic , systematically trotting alongside , to be handy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere , or a dead slave to be decently buried ; and though one or two other like instances might be set down , touching the set terms , places , and occasions , when sharks do most socially congregate , and most hilariously feast ; yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless numbers , and in gayer or more jovial spirits , than around a dead sperm whale , moored by night to a whaleship at sea . if you have never seen that sight , then suspend your decision about the propriety of devil-worship , and the expediency of conciliating the devil .
melville	moby	at such times , under an abated sun ; afloat all day upon smooth , slow heaving swells ; seated in his boat , light as a birch canoe ; and so sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves , that like hearth-stone cats they purr against the gunwale ; these are the times of dreamy quietude , when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the ocean ’ s skin , one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it ; and would not willingly remember , that this velvet paw but conceals a remorseless fang .
melville	moby	and half concealed in this queer tenement , i at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority ; and who , it being noon , and the ship ’ s work suspended , was now enjoying respite from the burden of command . he was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair , wriggling all over with curious carving ; and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed .
melville	moby	“ ‘ are you through ? ’ said don sebastian , quietly . “ ‘ i am , don. ’ “ ‘ then i entreat you , tell me if to the best of your own convictions , this your story is in substance really true ? it is so passing wonderful ! did you get it from an unquestionable source ? bear with me if i seem to press . ’
melville	moby	the bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the night previous , and whom i had not as yet had a good look at . they were nearly all whalemen ; chief mates , and second mates , and third mates , and sea carpenters , and sea coopers , and sea blacksmiths , and harpooneers , and ship keepers ; a brown and brawny company , with bosky beards ; an unshorn , shaggy set , all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns .
melville	moby	“ the aorta of a whale is larger in the bore than the main pipe of the water-works at london bridge , and the water roaring in its passage through that pipe is inferior in impetus and velocity to the blood gushing from the whale ’ s heart. ” —_paley ’ s theology_ .
melville	moby	but the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible confirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning . at sun-rise this man went from his hammock to his mast-head at the fore ; and whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep ( for sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state ) , whether it was thus with the man , there is now no telling ; but , be that as it may , he had not been long at his perch , when a cry was heard—a cry and a rushing—and looking up , they saw a falling phantom in the air ; and looking down , a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the sea .
melville	moby	in life , the visible surface of the sperm whale is not the least among the many marvels he presents . almost invariably it is all over obliquely crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in thick array , something like those in the finest italian line engravings . but these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above mentioned , but seem to be seen through it , as if they were engraved upon the body itself . nor is this all . in some instances , to the quick , observant eye , those linear marks , as in a veritable engraving , but afford the ground for far other delineations . these are hieroglyphical ; that is , if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics , then that is the proper word to use in the present connexion . by my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one sperm whale in particular , i was much struck with a plate representing the old indian characters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the upper mississippi . like those mystic rocks , too , the mystic-marked whale remains undecipherable . this allusion to the indian rocks reminds me of another thing . besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the sperm whale presents , he not seldom displays the back , and more especially his flanks , effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance , by reason of numerous rude scratches , altogether of an irregular , random aspect . i should say that those new england rocks on the sea-coast , which agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergs—i should say , that those rocks must not a little resemble the sperm whale in this particular . it also seems to me that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact with other whales ; for i have most remarked them in the large , full-grown bulls of the species .
melville	moby	still , we can hypothesize , even if we can not prove and establish . my hypothesis is this : that the spout is nothing but mist . and besides other reasons , to this conclusion i am impelled , by considerations touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the sperm whale ; i account him no common , shallow being , inasmuch as it is an undisputed fact that he is never found on soundings , or near shores ; all other whales sometimes are . he is both ponderous and profound . and i am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings , such as plato , pyrrho , the devil , jupiter , dante , and so on , there always goes up a certain semi-visible steam , while in the act of thinking deep thoughts . while composing a little treatise on eternity , i had the curiosity to place a mirror before me ; and ere long saw reflected there , a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over my head . the invariable moisture of my hair , while plunged in deep thought , after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic , of an august noon ; this seems an additional argument for the above supposition .
melville	moby	the liquor soon mounted into their heads , as it generally does even with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea , and they began capering about most obstreperously . i observed , however , that one of them held somewhat aloof , and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own sober face , yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as the rest . this man interested me at once ; and since the sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate ( though but a sleeping-partner one , so far as this narrative is concerned ) , i will here venture upon a little description of him . he stood full six feet in height , with noble shoulders , and a chest like a coffer-dam . i have seldom seen such brawn in a man . his face was deeply brown and burnt , making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast ; while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy . his voice at once announced that he was a southerner , and from his fine stature , i thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the alleghanian ridge in virginia . when the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height , this man slipped away unobserved , and i saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea . in a few minutes , however , he was missed by his shipmates , and being , it seems , for some reason a huge favourite with them , they raised a cry of “ bulkington ! bulkington ! where ’ s bulkington ? ” and darted out of the house in pursuit of him .
melville	moby	the english were preceded in the whale fishery by the hollanders , zealanders , and danes ; from whom they derived many terms still extant in the fishery ; and what is yet more , their fat old fashions , touching plenty to eat and drink . for , as a general thing , the english merchant-ship scrimps her crew ; but not so the english whaler . hence , in the english , this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural , but incidental and particular ; and , therefore , must have some special origin , which is here pointed out , and will be still further elucidated .
melville	moby	carpenter ( _resuming his work_ ) . well , well , well ! stubb knows him best of all , and stubb always says he ’ s queer ; says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer ; he ’ s queer , says stubb ; he ’ s queer—queer , queer ; and keeps dinning it into mr. starbuck all the time—queer—sir—queer , queer , very queer . and here ’ s his leg ! yes , now that i think of it , here ’ s his bedfellow ! has a stick of whale ’ s jaw-bone for a wife ! and this is his leg ; he ’ ll stand on this . what was that now about one leg standing in three places , and all three places standing in one hell—how was that ? oh ! i don ’ t wonder he looked so scornful at me ! i ’ m a sort of strange-thoughted sometimes , they say ; but that ’ s only haphazard-like . then , a short , little old body like me , should never undertake to wade out into deep waters with tall , heron-built captains ; the water chucks you under the chin pretty quick , and there ’ s a great cry for life-boats . and here ’ s the heron ’ s leg ! long and slim , sure enough ! now , for most folks one pair of legs lasts a lifetime , and that must be because they use them mercifully , as a tender-hearted old lady uses her roly-poly old coach-horses . but ahab ; oh he ’ s a hard driver . look , driven one leg to death , and spavined the other for life , and now wears out bone legs by the cord . halloa , there , you smut ! bear a hand there with those screws , and let ’ s finish it before the resurrection fellow comes a-calling with his horn for all legs , true or false , as brewery-men go round collecting old beer barrels , to fill ’ em up again . what a leg this is ! it looks like a real live leg , filed down to nothing but the core ; he ’ ll be standing on this to-morrow ; he ’ ll be taking altitudes on it . halloa ! i almost forgot the little oval slate , smoothed ivory , where he figures up the latitude . so , so ; chisel , file , and sand-paper , now !
melville	moby	as this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody pequod , the barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle ; and drawing still nearer , a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge try-pots , which , covered with the parchment-like _poke_ or stomach skin of the black fish , gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched hands of the crew . on the quarter-deck , the mates and harpooneers were dancing with the olive-hued girls who had eloped with them from the polynesian isles ; while suspended in an ornamented boat , firmly secured aloft between the foremast and mainmast , three long island negroes , with glittering fiddle-bows of whale ivory , were presiding over the hilarious jig . meanwhile , others of the ship ’ s company were tumultuously busy at the masonry of the try-works , from which the huge pots had been removed . you would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed bastille , such wild cries they raised , as the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the sea .
melville	moby	“ first congregational church , ” cried bildad , “ what ! that worships in deacon deuteronomy coleman ’ s meeting-house ? ” and so saying , taking out his spectacles , he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief , and putting them on very carefully , came out of the wigwam , and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks , took a good long look at queequeg .
melville	moby	it so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade , the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh , on the lower part of the bunch before described . but as the stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales , with the flesh perfectly healed around them , and no prominence of any kind to denote their place ; therefore , there must needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the ulceration alluded to . but still more curious was the fact of a lance-head of stone being found in him , not far from the buried iron , the flesh perfectly firm about it . who had darted that stone lance ? and when ? it might have been darted by some nor ’ west indian long before america was discovered .

melville	moby	“ ginger ? do i smell ginger ? ” suspiciously asked stubb , coming near . “ yes , this must be ginger , ” peering into the as yet untasted cup . then standing as if incredulous for a while , he calmly walked towards the astonished steward slowly saying , “ ginger ? ginger ? and will you have the goodness to tell me , mr. dough-boy , where lies the virtue of ginger ? ginger ! is ginger the sort of fuel you use , dough-boy , to kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal ? ginger ! —what the devil is ginger ? sea-coal ? firewood ? —lucifer matches ? —tinder ? —gunpowder ? —what the devil is ginger , i say , that you offer this cup to our poor queequeg here . ”
melville	moby	tied up and twisted ; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles ; haggardly firm and unyielding ; his eyes glowing like coals , that still glow in the ashes of ruin ; untottering ahab stood forth in the clearness of the morn ; lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl ’ s forehead of heaven .
melville	moby	at the period of our arrival at the island , the heaviest storage of the pequod had been almost completed ; comprising her beef , bread , water , fuel , and iron hoops and staves . but , as before hinted , for some time there was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and ends of things , both large and small .
melville	moby	squeeze ! squeeze ! squeeze ! all the morning long ; i squeezed that sperm till i myself almost melted into it ; i squeezed that sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me ; and i found myself unwittingly squeezing my co-laborers ’ hands in it , mistaking their hands for the gentle globules . such an abounding , affectionate , friendly , loving feeling did this avocation beget ; that at last i was continually squeezing their hands , and looking up into their eyes sentimentally ; as much as to say , —oh ! my dear fellow beings , why should we longer cherish any social acerbities , or know the slightest ill-humor or envy ! come ; let us squeeze hands all round ; nay , let us all squeeze ourselves into each other ; let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness .
melville	moby	during all this blackness of the elements , ahab , though assuming for the time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck , manifested the gloomiest reserve ; and more seldom than ever addressed his mates . in tempestuous times like these , after everything above and aloft has been secured , nothing more can be done but passively to await the issue of the gale . then captain and crew become practical fatalists . so , with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole , and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud , ahab for hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward , while an occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very eyelashes together . meantime , the crew driven from the forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows , stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist ; and the better to guard against the leaping waves , each man had slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to the rail , in which he swung as in a loosened belt . few or no words were spoken ; and the silent ship , as if manned by painted sailors in wax , day after day tore on through all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves . by night the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed ; still in silence the men swung in the bowlines ; still wordless ahab stood up to the blast . even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not seek that repose in his hammock . never could starbuck forget the old man ’ s aspect , when one night going down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood , he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his floor-screwed chair ; the rain and half-melted sleet of the storm from which he had some time before emerged , still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coat . on the table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and currents which have previously been spoken of . his lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand . though the body was erect , the head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of the tell-tale that swung from a beam in the ceiling . *
melville	moby	“ who ’ s there ? ” hearing the footstep at the door , but not turning round to it . “ on deck ! begone ! ” “ captain ahab mistakes ; it is i . the oil in the hold is leaking , sir . we must up burtons and break out . ”
melville	moby	“ up burtons and break out ? now that we are nearing japan ; heave-to here for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops ? ” “ either do that , sir , or waste in one day more oil than we may make good in a year . what we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth saving , sir . ”
melville	moby	“ no branch of zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled cetology , ” says captain scoresby , a.d. 1820 . “ it is not my intention , were it in my power , to enter into the inquiry as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families . * * * utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal ” ( sperm whale ) , says surgeon beale , a.d. 1839 .
melville	moby	shifting the barrow from my hand to his , he told me a funny story about the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen . it was in sag harbor . the owners of his ship , it seems , had lent him one , in which to carry his heavy chest to his boarding house . not to seem ignorant about the thing—though in truth he was entirely so , concerning the precise way in which to manage the barrow—queequeg puts his chest upon it ; lashes it fast ; and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf . “ why , ” said i , “ queequeg , you might have known better than that , one would think . didn ’ t the people laugh ? ”
melville	moby	as an overladen indiaman bearing down the hindostan coast with a deck load of frightened horses , careens , buries , rolls , and wallows on her way ; so did this old whale heave his aged bulk , and now and then partly turning over on his cumbrous rib-ends , expose the cause of his devious wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin . whether he had lost that fin in battle , or had been born without it , it were hard to say .
melville	moby	“ hast seen the white whale ? ” “ see you this ? ” and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it , he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone , terminating in a wooden head like a mallet .
melville	moby	“ he ’ s dead , mr. stubb , ” said daggoo . “ yes ; both pipes smoked out ! ” and withdrawing his own from his mouth , stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water ; and , for a moment , stood thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made .
melville	moby	broad on both bows , at the distance of some two or three miles , and forming a great semicircle , embracing one half of the level horizon , a continuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the noon-day air . unlike the straight perpendicular twin-jets of the right whale , which , dividing at top , fall over in two branches , like the cleft drooping boughs of a willow , the single forward-slanting spout of the sperm whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist , continually rising and falling away to leeward .
melville	moby	in fact , the artist ’ s design seemed this : a final theory of my own , partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom i conversed upon the subject . the picture represents a cape-horner in a great hurricane ; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its three dismantled masts alone visible ; and an exasperated whale , purposing to spring clean over the craft , is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast-heads .
melville	moby	and though of all men the moody captain of the pequod was the least given to that sort of shallowest assumption ; and though the only homage he ever exacted , was implicit , instantaneous obedience ; though he required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the quarter-deck ; and though there were times when , owing to peculiar circumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed , he addressed them in unusual terms , whether of condescension or _in terrorem_ , or otherwise ; yet even captain ahab was by no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea .
melville	moby	but if the doctrine of fast-fish be pretty generally applicable , the kindred doctrine of loose-fish is still more widely so . that is internationally and universally applicable . what was america in 1492 but a loose-fish , in which columbus struck the spanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and mistress ? what was poland to the czar ? what greece to the turk ? what india to england ? what at last will mexico be to the united states ? all loose-fish .
melville	moby	“ well , suppose i did ? what then ? i ’ ve part changed my flesh since that time , why not my mind ? besides , supposing we _are_ loaded with powder barrels aft and lucifers forward ; how the devil could the lucifers get afire in this drenching spray here ? why , my little man , you have pretty red hair , but you couldn ’ t get afire now . shake yourself ; you ’ re aquarius , or the water-bearer , flask ; might fill pitchers at your coat collar . don ’ t you see , then , that for these extra risks the marine insurance companies have extra guarantees ? here are hydrants , flask . but hark , again , and i ’ ll answer ye the other thing . first take your leg off from the crown of the anchor here , though , so i can pass the rope ; now listen . what ’ s the mighty difference between holding a mast ’ s lightning-rod in the storm , and standing close by a mast that hasn ’ t got any lightning-rod at all in a storm ? don ’ t you see , you timber-head , that no harm can come to the holder of the rod , unless the mast is first struck ? what are you talking about , then ? not one ship in a hundred carries rods , and ahab , —aye , man , and all of us , —were in no more danger then , in my poor opinion , than all the crews in ten thousand ships now sailing the seas . why , you king-post , you , i suppose you would have every man in the world go about with a small lightning-rod running up the corner of his hat , like a militia officer ’ s skewered feather , and trailing behind like his sash . why don ’ t ye be sensible , flask ? it ’ s easy to be sensible ; why don ’ t ye , then ? any man with half an eye can be sensible . ”
melville	moby	“ stand by , men ; he stirs , ” cried starbuck , as the three lines suddenly vibrated in the water , distinctly conducting upwards to them , as by magnetic wires , the life and death throbs of the whale , so that every oarsman felt them in his seat . the next moment , relieved in great part from the downward strain at the bows , the boats gave a sudden bounce upwards , as a small icefield will , when a dense herd of white bears are scared from it into the sea .

melville	moby	third among the harpooneers was daggoo , a gigantic , coal-black negro-savage , with a lion-like tread—an ahasuerus to behold . suspended from his ears were two golden hoops , so large that the sailors called them ring-bolts , and would talk of securing the top-sail halyards to them . in his youth daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler , lying in a lonely bay on his native coast . and never having been anywhere in the world but in africa , nantucket , and the pagan harbors most frequented by whalemen ; and having now led for many years the bold life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of men they shipped ; daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues , and erect as a giraffe , moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his socks . there was a corporeal humility in looking up at him ; and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a fortress . curious to tell , this imperial negro , ahasuerus daggoo , was the squire of little flask , who looked like a chess-man beside him . as for the residue of the pequod ’ s company , be it said , that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the mast employed in the american whale fishery , are americans born , though pretty nearly all the officers are . herein it is the same with the american whale fishery as with the american army and military and merchant navies , and the engineering forces employed in the construction of the american canals and railroads . the same , i say , because in all these cases the native american liberally provides the brains , the rest of the world as generously supplying the muscles . no small number of these whaling seamen belong to the azores , where the outward bound nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores . in like manner , the greenland whalers sailing out of hull or london , put in at the shetland islands , to receive the full complement of their crew . upon the passage homewards , they drop them there again . how it is , there is no telling , but islanders seem to make the best whalemen . they were nearly all islanders in the pequod , _isolatoes_ too , i call such , not acknowledging the common continent of men , but each _isolato_ living on a separate continent of his own . yet now , federated along one keel , what a set these isolatoes were ! an anacharsis clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea , and all the ends of the earth , accompanying old ahab in the pequod to lay the world ’ s grievances before that bar from which not very many of them ever come back . black little pip—he never did—oh , no ! he went before . poor alabama boy ! on the grim pequod ’ s forecastle , ye shall ere long see him , beating his tambourine ; prelusive of the eternal time , when sent for , to the great quarter-deck on high , he was bid strike in with angels , and beat his tambourine in glory ; called a coward here , hailed a hero there !
melville	moby	in the first place , it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish the fact , that among people at large , the business of whaling is not accounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions . if a stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society , it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits , were he presented to the company as a harpooneer , say ; and if in emulation of the naval officers he should append the initials s.w.f . ( sperm whale fishery ) to his visiting card , such a procedure would be deemed pre-eminently presuming and ridiculous .
melville	moby	“ good night , landlord , ” said i , “ you may go. ” i turned in , and never slept better in my life . chapter 4 . the counterpane . upon waking next morning about daylight , i found queequeg ’ s arm thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner . you had almost thought i had been his wife . the counterpane was of patchwork , full of odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles ; and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable cretan labyrinth of a figure , no two parts of which were of one precise shade—owing i suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade , his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times—this same arm of his , i say , looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt . indeed , partly lying on it as the arm did when i first awoke , i could hardly tell it from the quilt , they so blended their hues together ; and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that i could tell that queequeg was hugging me .
melville	moby	“ he says , monsieur , that he ’ s very happy to have been of any service to us. ” hearing this , the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties ( meaning himself and mate ) and concluded by inviting stubb down into his cabin to drink a bottle of bordeaux .
melville	moby	as , blind and deaf , the whale plunged forward , as if by sheer power of speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him ; as we thus tore a white gash in the sea , on all sides menaced as we flew , by the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us ; our beset boat was like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest , and striving to steer through their complicated channels and straits , knowing not at what moment it may be locked in and crushed .
melville	moby	his three boats stove around him , and oars and men both whirling in the eddies ; one captain , seizing the line-knife from his broken prow , had dashed at the whale , as an arkansas duellist at his foe , blindly seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the whale . that captain was ahab . and then it was , that suddenly sweeping his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him , moby dick had reaped away ahab ’ s leg , as a mower a blade of grass in the field . no turbaned turk , no hired venetian or malay , could have smote him with more seeming malice . small reason was there to doubt , then , that ever since that almost fatal encounter , ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale , all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him , not only all his bodily woes , but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations . the white whale swam before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them , till they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung . that intangible malignity which has been from the beginning ; to whose dominion even the modern christians ascribe one-half of the worlds ; which the ancient ophites of the east reverenced in their statue devil ; —ahab did not fall down and worship it like them ; but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale , he pitted himself , all mutilated , against it . all that most maddens and torments ; all that stirs up the lees of things ; all truth with malice in it ; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain ; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought ; all evil , to crazy ahab , were visibly personified , and made practically assailable in moby dick . he piled upon the whale ’ s white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from adam down ; and then , as if his chest had been a mortar , he burst his hot heart ’ s shell upon it .
melville	moby	and as for those who , previously hearing of the white whale , by chance caught sight of him ; in the beginning of the thing they had every one of them , almost , as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him , as for any other whale of that species . but at length , such calamities did ensue in these assaults—not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles , broken limbs , or devouring amputations—but fatal to the last degree of fatality ; those repeated disastrous repulses , all accumulating and piling their terrors upon moby dick ; those things had gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunters , to whom the story of the white whale had eventually come .
melville	moby	“ he waxes brave , but nevertheless obeys ; most careful bravery that ! ” murmured ahab , as starbuck disappeared . “ what ’ s that he said—ahab beware of ahab—there ’ s something there ! ” then unconsciously using the musket for a staff , with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little cabin ; but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed , and returning the gun to the rack , he went to the deck .
melville	moby	“ upon my soul , i am about of the same opinion ; so give the benediction , fleece , and i ’ ll away to my supper. ” upon this , fleece , holding both hands over the fishy mob , raised his shrill voice , and cried—
melville	moby	for the rest , blame not stubb too hardly . the thing is common in that fishery ; and in the sequel of the narrative , it will then be seen what like abandonment befell myself .
melville	moby	“ there he goes now ; to him nothing ’ s happened ; but to me , the skewer seems loosening out of the middle of the world . haul in , haul in , tahitian ! these lines run whole , and whirling out : come in broken , and dragging slow . ha , pip ? come to help ; eh , pip ? ”
melville	moby	* the sperm whale , as with all other species of the leviathan , but unlike most other fish , breeds indifferently at all seasons ; after a gestation which may probably be set down at nine months , producing but one at a time ; though in some few known instances giving birth to an esau and jacob : —a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats , curiously situated , one on each side of the anus ; but the breasts themselves extend upwards from that . when by chance these precious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter ’ s lance , the mother ’ s pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods . the milk is very sweet and rich ; it has been tasted by man ; it might do well with strawberries . when overflowing with mutual esteem , the whales salute _more hominum_ .

melville	moby	as he mounted the deck , ahab abruptly accosted him , without at all heeding what he had in his hand ; but in his broken lingo , the german soon evinced his complete ignorance of the white whale ; immediately turning the conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil can , with some remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in profound darkness—his last drop of bremen oil being gone , and not a single flying-fish yet captured to supply the deficiency ; concluding by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the fishery is technically called a _clean_ one ( that is , an empty one ) , well deserving the name of jungfrau or the virgin .

melville	moby	chapter 60 . the line . with reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described , as well as for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented , i have here to speak of the magical , sometimes horrible whale-line .
melville	moby	this terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their stationary fright . first , the whales forming the margin of our lake began to crowd a little , and tumble against each other , as if lifted by half spent billows from afar ; then the lake itself began faintly to heave and swell ; the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries vanished ; in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central circles began to swim in thickening clusters . yes , the long calm was departing . a low advancing hum was soon heard ; and then like to the tumultuous masses of block-ice when the great river hudson breaks up in spring , the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner centre , as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain . instantly starbuck and queequeg changed places ; starbuck taking the stern .
melville	moby	“ he is . but he will still be hunted , for all that . what is best let alone , that accursed thing is not always what least allures . he ’ s all a magnet ! how long since thou saw ’ st him last ? which way heading ? ”
melville	moby	once more . say you are in the country ; in some high land of lakes . take almost any path you please , and ten to one it carries you down in a dale , and leaves you there by a pool in the stream . there is magic in it . let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries—stand that man on his legs , set his feet a-going , and he will infallibly lead you to water , if water there be in all that region . should you ever be athirst in the great american desert , try this experiment , if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor . yes , as every one knows , meditation and water are wedded for ever .
melville	moby	as for the sign-painters ’ whales seen in the streets hanging over the shops of oil-dealers , what shall be said of them ? they are generally richard iii . whales , with dromedary humps , and very savage ; breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts , that is whaleboats full of mariners : their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue paint .
melville	moby	though the long period of a southern whaling voyage ( by far the longest of all voyages now or ever made by man ) , the peculiar perils of it , and the community of interest prevailing among a company , all of whom , high or low , depend for their profits , not upon fixed wages , but upon their common luck , together with their common vigilance , intrepidity , and hard work ; though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally ; yet , never mind how much like an old mesopotamian family these whalemen may , in some primitive instances , live together ; for all that , the punctilious externals , at least , of the quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed , and in no instance done away . indeed , many are the nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper parading his quarter-deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in any military navy ; nay , extorting almost as much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple , and not the shabbiest of pilot-cloth .
melville	moby	he tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea . the fire hissed in the waves ; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made . with slouched hat , ahab lurchingly paced the planks .
melville	moby	inasmuch , then , as this leviathan comes floundering down upon us from the head-waters of the eternities , it may be fitly inquired , whether , in the long course of his generations , he has not degenerated from the original bulk of his sires .
melville	moby	“ all your oaths to hunt the white whale are as binding as mine ; and heart , soul , and body , lungs and life , old ahab is bound . and that ye may know to what tune this heart beats ; look ye here ; thus i blow out the last fear ! ” and with one blast of his breath he extinguished the flame .
melville	moby	“ bad work , bad work ! mr. starbuck , ” said stubb , regarding the wreck , “ but the sea will have its way . stubb , for one , can ’ t fight it . you see , mr. starbuck , a wave has such a great long start before it leaps , all round the world it runs , and then comes the spring ! but as for me , all the start i have to meet it , is just across the deck here . but never mind ; it ’ s all in fun : so the old song says ; ” — ( _sings_ . )
melville	moby	i might proceed with several more examples , one way or another known to me , of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale . in more than one instance , he has been known , not only to chase the assailing boats back to their ships , but to pursue the ship itself , and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks . the english ship pusie hall can tell a story on that head ; and , as for his strength , let me say , that there have been examples where the lines attached to a running sperm whale have , in a calm , been transferred to the ship , and secured there ; the whale towing her great hull through the water , as a horse walks off with a cart . again , it is very often observed that , if the sperm whale , once struck , is allowed time to rally , he then acts , not so often with blind rage , as with wilful , deliberate designs of destruction to his pursuers ; nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his character , that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth , and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive minutes . but i must be content with only one more and a concluding illustration ; a remarkable and most significant one , by which you will not fail to see , that not only is the most marvellous event in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day , but that these marvels ( like all marvels ) are mere repetitions of the ages ; so that for the millionth time we say amen with solomon—verily there is nothing new under the sun .
melville	moby	thus , while in life the great whale ’ s body may have been a real terror to his foes , in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a world . are you a believer in ghosts , my friend ? there are other ghosts than the cock-lane one , and far deeper men than doctor johnson who believe in them .
melville	moby	meanwhile stubb , the third mate , betrayed no such far-gazing solicitudes . the whales might have made one of their regular soundings , not a temporary dive from mere fright ; and if that were the case , stubb , as his wont in such cases , it seems , was resolved to solace the languishing interval with his pipe . he withdrew it from his hatband , where he always wore it aslant like a feather . he loaded it , and rammed home the loading with his thumb-end ; but hardly had he ignited his match across the rough sandpaper of his hand , when tashtego , his harpooneer , whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed stars , suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat , crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry , “ down , down all , and give way ! —there they are ! ”
melville	moby	nor are the most conscientious compilations of natural history for the benefit of the young and tender , free from the same heinousness of mistake . look at that popular work “ goldsmith ’ s animated nature. ” in the abridged london edition of 1807 , there are plates of an alleged “ whale ” and a “ narwhale. ” i do not wish to seem inelegant , but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow ; and , as for the narwhale , one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one , that in this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent public of schoolboys .
melville	moby	but , though the world scouts at us whale hunters , yet does it unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage ; yea , an all-abounding adoration ! for almost all the tapers , lamps , and candles that burn round the globe , burn , as before so many shrines , to our glory !
melville	moby	a great pity , now , that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped . the fissure is about a foot across . probably the mother during an important interval was sailing down the peruvian coast , when earthquakes caused the beach to gape . over this lip , as over a slippery threshold , we now slide into the mouth . upon my word were i at mackinaw , i should take this to be the inside of an indian wigwam . good lord ! is this the road that jonah went ? the roof is about twelve feet high , and runs to a pretty sharp angle , as if there were a regular ridge-pole there ; while these ribbed , arched , hairy sides , present us with those wondrous , half vertical , scimetar-shaped slats of whalebone , say three hundred on a side , which depending from the upper part of the head or crown bone , form those venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned . the edges of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres , through which the right whale strains the water , and in whose intricacies he retains the small fish , when openmouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feeding time . in the central blinds of bone , as they stand in their natural order , there are certain curious marks , curves , hollows , and ridges , whereby some whalemen calculate the creature ’ s age , as the age of an oak by its circular rings . though the certainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable , yet it has the savor of analogical probability . at any rate , if we yield to it , we must grant a far greater age to the right whale than at first glance will seem reasonable .
melville	moby	by midnight the works were in full operation . we were clear from the carcase ; sail had been made ; the wind was freshening ; the wild ocean darkness was intense . but that darkness was licked up by the fierce flames , which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues , and illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging , as with the famed greek fire . the burning ship drove on , as if remorselessly commissioned to some vengeful deed . so the pitch and sulphur-freighted brigs of the bold hydriote , canaris , issuing from their midnight harbors , with broad sheets of flame for sails , bore down upon the turkish frigates , and folded them in conflagrations .
melville	moby	chapter 29 . enter ahab ; to him , stubb . some days elapsed , and ice and icebergs all astern , the pequod now went rolling through the bright quito spring , which , at sea , almost perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal august of the tropic . the warmly cool , clear , ringing , perfumed , overflowing , redundant days , were as crystal goblets of persian sherbet , heaped up—flaked up , with rose-water snow . the starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets , nursing at home in lonely pride , the memory of their absent conquering earls , the golden helmeted suns ! for sleeping man , ’ twas hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing nights . but all the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward world . inward they turned upon the soul , especially when the still mild hours of eve came on ; then , memory shot her crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights . and all these subtle agencies , more and more they wrought on ahab ’ s texture .
melville	moby	“ what was it , sir ? ” said flask . “ the great live squid , which , they say , few whale-ships ever beheld , and returned to their ports to tell of it. ” but ahab said nothing ; turning his boat , he sailed back to the vessel ; the rest as silently following .
melville	moby	“ on the fourth day of the sail , a large canoe was descried , which seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals . he steered away from it ; but the savage craft bore down on him ; and soon the voice of steelkilt hailed him to heave to , or he would run him under water . the captain presented a pistol . with one foot on each prow of the yoked war-canoes , the lakeman laughed him to scorn ; assuring him that if the pistol so much as clicked in the lock , he would bury him in bubbles and foam .
melville	moby	a whole hour now passed ; gold-beaten out to ages . time itself now held long breaths with keen suspense . but at last , some three points off the weather bow , ahab descried the spout again , and instantly from the three mast-heads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had voiced it .
melville	moby	now , by all odds , the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to be the whale ’ s , is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of elephanta , in india . the brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda , all the trades and pursuits , every conceivable avocation of man , were prefigured ages before any of them actually came into being . no wonder then , that in some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth . the hindoo whale referred to , occurs in a separate department of the wall , depicting the incarnation of vishnu in the form of leviathan , learnedly known as the matse avatar . but though this sculpture is half man and half whale , so as only to give the tail of the latter , yet that small section of him is all wrong . it looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda , than the broad palms of the true whale ’ s majestic flukes .
melville	moby	to accomplish his object ahab must use tools ; and of all tools used in the shadow of the moon , men are most apt to get out of order . he knew , for example , that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was over starbuck , yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership ; for to the purely spiritual , the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation . starbuck ’ s body and starbuck ’ s coerced will were ahab ’ s , so long as ahab kept his magnet at starbuck ’ s brain ; still he knew that for all this the chief mate , in his soul , abhorred his captain ’ s quest , and could he , would joyfully disintegrate himself from it , or even frustrate it . it might be that a long interval would elapse ere the white whale was seen . during that long interval starbuck would ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his captain ’ s leadership , unless some ordinary , prudential , circumstantial influences were brought to bear upon him . not only that , but the subtle insanity of ahab respecting moby dick was noways more significantly manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that , for the present , the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it ; that the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure background ( for few men ’ s courage is proof against protracted meditation unrelieved by action ) ; that when they stood their long night watches , his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of than moby dick . for however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest ; yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable—they live in the varying outer weather , and they inhale its fickleness—and when retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit , however promissory of life and passion in the end , it is above all things requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene and hold them healthily suspended for the final dash .
melville	moby	“ aye , i see ! —wanted to part it ; free the fast-fish—an old trick—i know him. ” “ how it was exactly , ” continued the one-armed commander , “ i do not know ; but in biting the line , it got foul of his teeth , caught there somehow ; but we didn ’ t know it then ; so that when we afterwards pulled on the line , bounce we came plump on to his hump ! instead of the other whale ’ s ; that went off to windward , all fluking . seeing how matters stood , and what a noble great whale it was—the noblest and biggest i ever saw , sir , in my life—i resolved to capture him , spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in . and thinking the hap-hazard line would get loose , or the tooth it was tangled to might draw ( for i have a devil of a boat ’ s crew for a pull on a whale-line ) ; seeing all this , i say , i jumped into my first mate ’ s boat—mr . mounttop ’ s here ( by the way , captain—mounttop ; mounttop—the captain ) ; —as i was saying , i jumped into mounttop ’ s boat , which , d ’ ye see , was gunwale and gunwale with mine , then ; and snatching the first harpoon , let this old great-grandfather have it . but , lord , look you , sir—hearts and souls alive , man—the next instant , in a jiff , i was blind as a bat—both eyes out—all befogged and bedeadened with black foam—the whale ’ s tail looming straight up out of it , perpendicular in the air , like a marble steeple . no use sterning all , then ; but as i was groping at midday , with a blinding sun , all crown-jewels ; as i was groping , i say , after the second iron , to toss it overboard—down comes the tail like a lima tower , cutting my boat in two , leaving each half in splinters ; and , flukes first , the white hump backed through the wreck , as though it was all chips . we all struck out . to escape his terrible flailings , i seized hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him , and for a moment clung to that like a sucking fish . but a combing sea dashed me off , and at the same instant , the fish , taking one good dart forwards , went down like a flash ; and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me caught me here ” ( clapping his hand just below his shoulder ) ; “ yes , caught me just here , i say , and bore me down to hell ’ s flames , i was thinking ; when , when , all of a sudden , thank the good god , the barb ript its way along the flesh—clear along the whole length of my arm—came out nigh my wrist , and up i floated ; —and that gentleman there will tell you the rest ( by the way , captain—dr . bunger , ship ’ s surgeon : bunger , my lad , —the captain ) . now , bunger boy , spin your part of the yarn . ”
melville	moby	“ in black distress , i called my god , when i could scarce believe him mine , he bowed his ear to my complaints— no more the whale did me confine . “ with speed he flew to my relief , as on a radiant dolphin borne ; awful , yet bright , as lightning shone the face of my deliverer god .
melville	moby	“ how old do you suppose fedallah is , stubb ? ” “ do you see that mainmast there ? ” pointing to the ship ; “ well , that ’ s the figure one ; now take all the hoops in the pequod ’ s hold , and string along in a row with that mast , for oughts , do you see ; well , that wouldn ’ t begin to be fedallah ’ s age . nor all the coopers in creation couldn ’ t show hoops enough to make oughts enough . ”
melville	moby	below in his hammock , ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn , when he came to the deck ; it was then recounted to him by flask , not unaccompanied with hinted dark meanings . he hollowly laughed , and thus explained the wonder .
melville	moby	no man prefers to sleep two in a bed . in fact , you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother . i don ’ t know how it is , but people like to be private when they are sleeping . and when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger , in a strange inn , in a strange town , and that stranger a harpooneer , then your objections indefinitely multiply . nor was there any earthly reason why i as a sailor should sleep two in a bed , more than anybody else ; for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea , than bachelor kings do ashore . to be sure they all sleep together in one apartment , but you have your own hammock , and cover yourself with your own blanket , and sleep in your own skin .
melville	moby	but this did by no means prevent all communications . preserving an interval of some few yards between itself and the ship , the jeroboam ’ s boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to the pequod , as she heavily forged through the sea ( for by this time it blew very fresh ) , with her main-topsail aback ; though , indeed , at times by the sudden onset of a large rolling wave , the boat would be pushed some way ahead ; but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper bearings again . subject to this , and other the like interruptions now and then , a conversation was sustained between the two parties ; but at intervals not without still another interruption of a very different sort .
melville	moby	chapter 71 . the jeroboam ’ s story . hand in hand , ship and breeze blew on ; but the breeze came faster than the ship , and soon the pequod began to rock . by and by , through the glass the stranger ’ s boats and manned mast-heads proved her a whale-ship . but as she was so far to windward , and shooting by , apparently making a passage to some other ground , the pequod could not hope to reach her . so the signal was set to see what response would be made .
melville	moby	measured for a leg ! good . well , it ’ s not the first time . about it ! there ; keep thy finger on it . this is a cogent vice thou hast here , carpenter ; let me feel its grip once . so , so ; it does pinch some .
melville	moby	at some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung by the tail for knockers to the road-side door . when the porter is sleepy , the anvil-headed whale would be best . but these knocking whales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays . on the spires of some old-fashioned churches you will see sheet-iron whales placed there for weather-cocks ; but they are so elevated , and besides that are to all intents and purposes so labelled with “ _hands off ! _ ” you can not examine them closely enough to decide upon their merit .
melville	moby	now , when with royal tranquo i visited this wondrous whale , and saw the skull an altar , and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real jet had issued , i marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an object of vertu . he laughed . but more i marvelled that the priests should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine . to and fro i paced before this skeleton—brushed the vines aside—broke through the ribs—and with a ball of arsacidean twine , wandered , eddied long amid its many winding , shaded colonnades and arbours . but soon my line was out ; and following it back , i emerged from the opening where i entered . i saw no living thing within ; naught was there but bones .
melville	moby	but a day or two after , you look about you , and prick your ears in this self-same ship ; and were it not for the tell-tale boats and try-works , you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel , with a most scrupulously neat commander . the unmanufactured sperm oil possesses a singularly cleansing virtue . this is the reason why the decks never look so white as just after what they call an affair of oil . besides , from the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale , a potent lye is readily made ; and whenever any adhesiveness from the back of the whale remains clinging to the side , that lye quickly exterminates it . hands go diligently along the bulwarks , and with buckets of water and rags restore them to their full tidiness . the soot is brushed from the lower rigging . all the numerous implements which have been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed and put away . the great hatch is scrubbed and placed upon the try-works , completely hiding the pots ; every cask is out of sight ; all tackles are coiled in unseen nooks ; and when by the combined and simultaneous industry of almost the entire ship ’ s company , the whole of this conscientious duty is at last concluded , then the crew themselves proceed to their own ablutions ; shift themselves from top to toe ; and finally issue to the immaculate deck , fresh and all aglow , as bridegrooms new-leaped from out the daintiest holland .
melville	moby	the fact is , that among his hunters at least , the whale would by all hands be considered a noble dish , were there not so much of him ; but when you come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet long , it takes away your appetite . only the most unprejudiced of men like stubb , nowadays partake of cooked whales ; but the esquimaux are not so fastidious . we all know how they live upon whales , and have rare old vintages of prime old train oil . zogranda , one of their most famous doctors , recommends strips of blubber for infants , as being exceedingly juicy and nourishing . and this reminds me that certain englishmen , who long ago were accidentally left in greenland by a whaling vessel—that these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber . among the dutch whalemen these scraps are called “ fritters ” ; which , indeed , they greatly resemble , being brown and crisp , and smelling something like old amsterdam housewives ’ dough-nuts or oly-cooks , when fresh . they have such an eatable look that the most self-denying stranger can hardly keep his hands off .
melville	moby	“ fiery pit ! fiery pit ! ye insult me , man ; past all natural bearing , ye insult me . it ’ s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that he ’ s bound to hell . flukes and flames ! bildad , say that again to me , and start my soul-bolts , but i ’ ll—i ’ ll—yes , i ’ ll swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on . out of the cabin , ye canting , drab-coloured son of a wooden gun—a straight wake with ye ! ”
melville	moby	see with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of lamps—often but old bottles and vials , though—to the copper cooler at the try-works , and replenishes them there , as mugs of ale at a vat . he burns , too , the purest of oil , in its unmanufactured , and , therefore , unvitiated state ; a fluid unknown to solar , lunar , or astral contrivances ashore . it is sweet as early grass butter in april . he goes and hunts for his oil , so as to be sure of its freshness and genuineness , even as the traveller on the prairie hunts up his own supper of game .
melville	moby	“ i will wager something now , ” whispered stubb to flask , “ that some one in that missing boat wore off that captain ’ s best coat ; mayhap , his watch—he ’ s so cursed anxious to get it back . who ever heard of two pious whale-ships cruising after one missing whale-boat in the height of the whaling season ? see , flask , only see how pale he looks—pale in the very buttons of his eyes—look—it wasn ’ t the coat—it must have been the— ”
melville	moby	you observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the sperm whale , the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the water ; you observe that the lower part of that front slopes considerably backwards , so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which receives the boom-like lower jaw ; you observe that the mouth is entirely under the head , much in the same way , indeed , as though your own mouth were entirely under your chin . moreover you observe that the whale has no external nose ; and that what nose he has—his spout hole—is on the top of his head ; you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides of his head , nearly one third of his entire length from the front . wherefore , you must now have perceived that the front of the sperm whale ’ s head is a dead , blind wall , without a single organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever . furthermore , you are now to consider that only in the extreme , lower , backward sloping part of the front of the head , is there the slightest vestige of bone ; and not till you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the full cranial development . so that this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad . finally , though , as will soon be revealed , its contents partly comprise the most delicate oil ; yet , you are now to be apprised of the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all that apparent effeminacy . in some previous place i have described to you how the blubber wraps the body of the whale , as the rind wraps an orange . just so with the head ; but with this difference : about the head this envelope , though not so thick , is of a boneless toughness , inestimable by any man who has not handled it . the severest pointed harpoon , the sharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm , impotently rebounds from it . it is as though the forehead of the sperm whale were paved with horses ’ hoofs . i do not think that any sensation lurks in it .
melville	moby	furthermore , as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting canal , and as that long canal—like the grand erie canal—is furnished with a sort of locks ( that open and shut ) for the downward retention of air or the upward exclusion of water , therefore the whale has no voice ; unless you insult him by saying , that when he so strangely rumbles , he talks through his nose . but then again , what has the whale to say ? seldom have i known any profound being that had anything to say to this world , unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a living . oh ! happy that the world is such an excellent listener !
melville	moby	“ there she blows ! there ! there ! there ! she blows ! she blows ! ” “ where-away ? ” “ on the lee-beam , about two miles off ! a school of them ! ” instantly all was commotion . the sperm whale blows as a clock ticks , with the same undeviating and reliable uniformity . and thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from other tribes of his genus .
melville	moby	but how now ? in this zoned quest , does ahab touch no land ? does his crew drink air ? surely , he will stop for water . nay . for a long time , now , the circus-running sun has raced within his fiery ring , and needs no sustenance but what ’ s in himself . so ahab . mark this , too , in the whaler . while other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff , to be transferred to foreign wharves ; the world-wandering whale-ship carries no cargo but herself and crew , their weapons and their wants . she has a whole lake ’ s contents bottled in her ample hold . she is ballasted with utilities ; not altogether with unusable pig-lead and kentledge . she carries years ’ water in her . clear old prime nantucket water ; which , when three years afloat , the nantucketer , in the pacific , prefers to drink before the brackish fluid , but yesterday rafted off in casks , from the peruvian or indian streams . hence it is , that , while other ships may have gone to china from new york , and back again , touching at a score of ports , the whale-ship , in all that interval , may not have sighted one grain of soil ; her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like themselves . so that did you carry them the news that another flood had come ; they would only answer— “ well , boys , here ’ s the ark ! ”
melville	moby	the story told , the stranger captain immediately went on to reveal his object in boarding the pequod . he desired that ship to unite with his own in the search ; by sailing over the sea some four or five miles apart , on parallel lines , and so sweeping a double horizon , as it were .
melville	moby	but all these foolish arguments of old sag-harbor only evinced his foolish pride of reason—a thing still more reprehensible in him , seeing that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the sun and the sea . i say it only shows his foolish , impious pride , and abominable , devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy . for by a portuguese catholic priest , this very idea of jonah ’ s going to nineveh via the cape of good hope was advanced as a signal magnification of the general miracle . and so it was . besides , to this day , the highly enlightened turks devoutly believe in the historical story of jonah . and some three centuries ago , an english traveller in old harris ’ s voyages , speaks of a turkish mosque built in honor of jonah , in which mosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil .
melville	moby	“ captain ahab , ” said tashtego , “ that white whale must be the same that some call moby dick. ” “ moby dick ? ” shouted ahab . “ do ye know the white whale then , tash ? ” “ does he fan-tail a little curious , sir , before he goes down ? ” said the gay-header deliberately .
melville	moby	then , again , in 1825 , bernard germain , count de lacépède , a great naturalist , published a scientific systemized whale book , wherein are several pictures of the different species of the leviathan . all these are not only incorrect , but the picture of the mysticetus or greenland whale ( that is to say , the right whale ) , even scoresby , a long experienced man as touching that species , declares not to have its counterpart in nature .
melville	moby	“ ‘ turn to ! i make no promises , turn to , i say ! ’ “ ‘ look ye , now , ’ cried the lakeman , flinging out his arm towards him , ‘ there are a few of us here ( and i am one of them ) who have shipped for the cruise , d ’ ye see ; now as you well know , sir , we can claim our discharge as soon as the anchor is down ; so we don ’ t want a row ; it ’ s not our interest ; we want to be peaceable ; we are ready to work , but we won ’ t be flogged . ’
melville	moby	in that sloping afternoon sunlight , the shadows that the three boats sent down beneath the surface , must have been long enough and broad enough to shade half xerxes ’ army . who can tell how appalling to the wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head !
melville	moby	but fortunately the special point i here seek can be established upon testimony entirely independent of my own . that point is this : the sperm whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful , knowing , and judiciously malicious , as with direct aforethought to stave in , utterly destroy , and sink a large ship ; and what is more , the sperm whale _has_ done it .
melville	moby	the more i consider this mighty tail , the more do i deplore my inability to express it . at times there are gestures in it , which , though they would well grace the hand of man , remain wholly inexplicable . in an extensive herd , so remarkable , occasionally , are these mystic gestures , that i have heard hunters who have declared them akin to free-mason signs and symbols ; that the whale , indeed , by these methods intelligently conversed with the world . nor are there wanting other motions of the whale in his general body , full of strangeness , and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant . dissect him how i may , then , i but go skin deep ; i know him not , and never will . but if i know not even the tail of this whale , how understand his head ? much more , how comprehend his face , when face he has none ? thou shalt see my back parts , my tail , he seems to say , but my face shall not be seen . but i can not completely make out his back parts ; and hint what he will about his face , i say again he has no face .

melville	moby	“ good again . now then , thou not only wantest to go a-whaling , to find out by experience what whaling is , but ye also want to go in order to see the world ? was not that what ye said ? i thought so . well then , just step forward there , and take a peep over the weather-bow , and then back to me and tell me what ye see there . ”
melville	moby	second : it is a little significant , that while one sperm whale only fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw , nevertheless , in his conflicts with man , he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail . in striking at a boat , he swiftly curves away his flukes from it , and the blow is only inflicted by the recoil . if it be made in the unobstructed air , especially if it descend to its mark , the stroke is then simply irresistible . no ribs of man or boat can withstand it . your only salvation lies in eluding it ; but if it comes sideways through the opposing water , then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the whale-boat , and the elasticity of its materials , a cracked rib or a dashed plank or two , a sort of stitch in the side , is generally the most serious result . these submerged side blows are so often received in the fishery , that they are accounted mere child ’ s play . some one strips off a frock , and the hole is stopped .
melville	moby	lord save me , thinks i , that must be the harpooneer , the infernal head-peddler . but i lay perfectly still , and resolved not to say a word till spoken to . holding a light in one hand , and that identical new zealand head in the other , the stranger entered the room , and without looking towards the bed , placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner , and then began working away at the knotted cords of the large bag i before spoke of as being in the room . i was all eagerness to see his face , but he kept it averted for some time while employed in unlacing the bag ’ s mouth . this accomplished , however , he turned round—when , good heavens ! what a sight ! such a face ! it was of a dark , purplish , yellow colour , here and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares . yes , it ’ s just as i thought , he ’ s a terrible bedfellow ; he ’ s been in a fight , got dreadfully cut , and here he is , just from the surgeon . but at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light , that i plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all , those black squares on his cheeks . they were stains of some sort or other . at first i knew not what to make of this ; but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me . i remembered a story of a white man—a whaleman too—who , falling among the cannibals , had been tattooed by them . i concluded that this harpooneer , in the course of his distant voyages , must have met with a similar adventure . and what is it , thought i , after all ! it ’ s only his outside ; a man can be honest in any sort of skin . but then , what to make of his unearthly complexion , that part of it , i mean , lying round about , and completely independent of the squares of tattooing . to be sure , it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning ; but i never heard of a hot sun ’ s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one . however , i had never been in the south seas ; and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin . now , while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning , this harpooneer never noticed me at all . but , after some difficulty having opened his bag , he commenced fumbling in it , and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk , and a seal-skin wallet with the hair on . placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room , he then took the new zealand head—a ghastly thing enough—and crammed it down into the bag . he now took off his hat—a new beaver hat—when i came nigh singing out with fresh surprise . there was no hair on his head—none to speak of at least—nothing but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead . his bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull . had not the stranger stood between me and the door , i would have bolted out of it quicker than ever i bolted a dinner .
melville	moby	there was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his delirious but still methodical scheme . but not so in the reality , perhaps . though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons for particular grounds , yet in general you can not conclude that the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year , say , will turn out to be identically the same with those that were found there the preceding season ; though there are peculiar and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true . in general , the same remark , only within a less wide limit , applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured , aged sperm whales . so that though moby dick had in a former year been seen , for example , on what is called the seychelle ground in the indian ocean , or volcano bay on the japanese coast ; yet it did not follow , that were the pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season , she would infallibly encounter him there . so , too , with some other feeding grounds , where he had at times revealed himself . but all these seemed only his casual stopping-places and ocean-inns , so to speak , not his places of prolonged abode . and where ahab ’ s chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken of , allusion has only been made to whatever way-side , antecedent , extra prospects were his , ere a particular set time or place were attained , when all possibilities would become probabilities , and , as ahab fondly thought , every possibility the next thing to a certainty . that particular set time and place were conjoined in the one technical phrase—the season-on-the-line . for there and then , for several consecutive years , moby dick had been periodically descried , lingering in those waters for awhile , as the sun , in its annual round , loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of the zodiac . there it was , too , that most of the deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place ; there the waves were storied with his deeds ; there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance . but in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with which ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt , he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning fact above mentioned , however flattering it might be to those hopes ; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest .
melville	moby	as if to strike a quick terror into them , by this time being the first assailant himself , moby dick had turned , and was now coming for the three crews . ahab ’ s boat was central ; and cheering his men , he told them he would take the whale head-and-head , —that is , pull straight up to his forehead , —a not uncommon thing ; for when within a certain limit , such a course excludes the coming onset from the whale ’ s sidelong vision . but ere that close limit was gained , and while yet all three boats were plain as the ship ’ s three masts to his eye ; the white whale churning himself into furious speed , almost in an instant as it were , rushing among the boats with open jaws , and a lashing tail , offered appalling battle on every side ; and heedless of the irons darted at him from every boat , seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank of which those boats were made . but skilfully manœuvred , incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in the field ; the boats for a while eluded him ; though , at times , but by a plank ’ s breadth ; while all the time , ahab ’ s unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds .
melville	moby	then gazing at his quadrant , and handling , one after the other , its numerous cabalistical contrivances , he pondered again , and muttered : “ foolish toy ! babies ’ plaything of haughty admirals , and commodores , and captains ; the world brags of thee , of thy cunning and might ; but what after all canst thou do , but tell the poor , pitiful point , where thou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet , and the hand that holds thee : no ! not one jot more ! thou canst not tell where one drop of water or one grain of sand will be to-morrow noon ; and yet with thy impotence thou insultest the sun ! science ! curse thee , thou vain toy ; and cursed be all the things that cast man ’ s eyes aloft to that heaven , whose live vividness but scorches him , as these old eyes are even now scorched with thy light , o sun ! level by nature to this earth ’ s horizon are the glances of man ’ s eyes ; not shot from the crown of his head , as if god had meant him to gaze on his firmament . curse thee , thou quadrant ! ” dashing it to the deck , “ no longer will i guide my earthly way by thee ; the level ship ’ s compass , and the level dead-reckoning , by log and by line ; _these_ shall conduct me , and show me my place on the sea . aye , ” lighting from the boat to the deck , “ thus i trample on thee , thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high ; thus i split and destroy thee ! ”
melville	moby	“ the birds ! —the birds ! ” cried tashtego . in long indian file , as when herons take wing , the white birds were now all flying towards ahab ’ s boat ; and when within a few yards began fluttering over the water there , wheeling round and round , with joyous , expectant cries . their vision was keener than man ’ s ; ahab could discover no sign in the sea . but suddenly as he peered down and down into its depths , he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white weasel , with wonderful celerity uprising , and magnifying as it rose , till it turned , and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked rows of white , glistening teeth , floating up from the undiscoverable bottom . it was moby dick ’ s open mouth and scrolled jaw ; his vast , shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea . the glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open-doored marble tomb ; and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar , ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous apparition . then , calling upon fedallah to change places with him , went forward to the bows , and seizing perth ’ s harpoon , commanded his crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern .
melville	moby	abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison . though true cylinders without—within , the villanous green goggling glasses deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom . parallel meridians rudely pecked into the glass , surround these footpads ’ goblets . fill to _this_ mark , and your charge is but a penny ; to _this_ a penny more ; and so on to the full glass—the cape horn measure , which you may gulp down for a shilling .
melville	moby	as before , the attentive ship having descried the whole fight , again came bearing down to the rescue , and dropping a boat , picked up the floating mariners , tubs , oars , and whatever else could be caught at , and safely landed them on her decks . some sprained shoulders , wrists , and ankles ; livid contusions ; wrenched harpoons and lances ; inextricable intricacies of rope ; shattered oars and planks ; all these were there ; but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen any one . as with fedallah the day before , so ahab was now found grimly clinging to his boat ’ s broken half , which afforded a comparatively easy float ; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous day ’ s mishap .
melville	moby	“ fellow-critters : i ’ se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam noise dare . you hear ? stop dat dam smackin ’ ob de lip ! massa stubb say dat you can fill your dam bellies up to de hatchings , but by gor ! you must stop dat dam racket ! ”
melville	moby	i was a little alarmed by his energy , perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation , but said as calmly as i could , “ what you say is no doubt true enough , sir ; but how could i know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale , though indeed i might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident . ”
melville	moby	there now is your insular city of the manhattoes , belted round by wharves as indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with her surf . right and left , the streets take you waterward . its extreme downtown is the battery , where that noble mole is washed by waves , and cooled by breezes , which a few hours previous were out of sight of land . look at the crowds of water-gazers there .
melville	moby	so soon as this figure had been first descried , stubb had exclaimed— “ that ’ s he ! that ’ s he ! —the long-togged scaramouch the town-ho ’ s company told us of ! ” stubb here alluded to a strange story told of the jeroboam , and a certain man among her crew , some time previous when the pequod spoke the town-ho . according to this account and what was subsequently learned , it seemed that the scaramouch in question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the jeroboam . his story was this :
melville	moby	were this world an endless plain , and by sailing eastward we could for ever reach new distances , and discover sights more sweet and strange than any cyclades or islands of king solomon , then there were promise in the voyage . but in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of , or in tormented chase of that demon phantom that , some time or other , swims before all human hearts ; while chasing such over this round globe , they either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed .
melville	moby	“ he says , monsieur , that his principles won ’ t admit of his drinking ; but that if monsieur wants to live another day to drink , then monsieur had best drop all four boats , and pull the ship away from these whales , for it ’ s so calm they won ’ t drift . ”
melville	moby	first : the mariner , when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands , if by night he hear the roar of breakers , starts to vigilance , and feels just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties ; but under precisely similar circumstances , let him be called from his hammock to view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness—as if from encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming round him , then he feels a silent , superstitious dread ; the shrouded phantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost ; in vain the lead assures him he is still off soundings ; heart and helm they both go down ; he never rests till blue water is under him again . yet where is the mariner who will tell thee , “ sir , it was not so much the fear of striking hidden rocks , as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so stirred me ? ”
melville	moby	seen from the pequod ’ s deck , then , as she would rise on a high hill of the sea , this host of vapory spouts , individually curling up into the air , and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze , showed like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis , descried of a balmy autumnal morning , by some horseman on a height .
melville	moby	“ believe it or not , thou canst not die till it be seen , old man. ” “ and what was that saying about thyself ? ” “ though it come to the last , i shall still go before thee thy pilot . ”
melville	moby	“ cook , ” here interposed stubb , accompanying the word with a sudden slap on the shoulder , — “ cook ! why , damn your eyes , you mustn ’ t swear that way when you ’ re preaching . that ’ s no way to convert sinners , cook ! ”
melville	moby	chapter 96 . the try-works . besides her hoisted boats , an american whaler is outwardly distinguished by her try-works . she presents the curious anomaly of the most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the completed ship . it is as if from the open field a brick-kiln were transported to her planks .
melville	moby	but , taken for all in all , by far the finest , though in some details not the most correct , presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be anywhere found , are two large french engravings , well executed , and taken from paintings by one garnery . respectively , they represent attacks on the sperm and right whale . in the first engraving a noble sperm whale is depicted in full majesty of might , just risen beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean , and bearing high in the air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks . the prow of the boat is partially unbroken , and is drawn just balancing upon the monster ’ s spine ; and standing in that prow , for that one single incomputable flash of time , you behold an oarsman , half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale , and in the act of leaping , as if from a precipice . the action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and true . the half-emptied line-tub floats on the whitened sea ; the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it ; the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions of affright ; while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene . serious fault might be found with the anatomical details of this whale , but let that pass ; since , for the life of me , i could not draw so good a one .
melville	moby	“ ‘ a pretty scholar , ’ laughed the lakeman . ‘ adios , senor ! ’ and leaping into the sea , he swam back to his comrades . “ watching the boat till it was fairly beached , and drawn up to the roots of the cocoa-nut trees , steelkilt made sail again , and in due time arrived at tahiti , his own place of destination . there , luck befriended him ; two ships were about to sail for france , and were providentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headed . they embarked ; and so for ever got the start of their former captain , had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution .
melville	moby	“ wood-house ! ” cried i , “ which way to it ? run for god ’ s sake , and fetch something to pry open the door—the axe ! —the axe ! he ’ s had a stroke ; depend upon it ! ” —and so saying i was unmethodically rushing up stairs again empty-handed , when mrs. hussey interposed the mustard-pot and vinegar-cruet , and the entire castor of her countenance .
melville	moby	it was a sight full of quick wonder and awe ! the vast swells of the omnipotent sea ; the surging , hollow roar they made , as they rolled along the eight gunwales , like gigantic bowls in a boundless bowling-green ; the brief suspended agony of the boat , as it would tip for an instant on the knife-like edge of the sharper waves , that almost seemed threatening to cut it in two ; the sudden profound dip into the watery glens and hollows ; the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the top of the opposite hill ; the headlong , sled-like slide down its other side ; —all these , with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers , and the shuddering gasps of the oarsmen , with the wondrous sight of the ivory pequod bearing down upon her boats with outstretched sails , like a wild hen after her screaming brood ; —all this was thrilling .
melville	moby	“ espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the rest , the lakeman affected not to notice him , but unawed , went on with his gay banterings .
melville	moby	when this last task was accomplished it was noon , and the seamen went below to their dinner . silence reigned over the before tumultuous but now deserted deck . an intense copper calm , like a universal yellow lotus , was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves upon the sea .
melville	moby	“ faith , sir , i ’ ve—— ” “ faith ? what ’ s that ? ” “ why , faith , sir , it ’ s only a sort of exclamation-like—that ’ s all , sir. ” “ um , um ; go on. ” “ i was about to say , sir , that—— ” “ art thou a silk-worm ? dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself ? look at thy bosom ! despatch ! and get these traps out of sight . ”
melville	moby	his story being ended with his pipe ’ s last dying puff , queequeg embraced me , pressed his forehead against mine , and blowing out the light , we rolled over from each other , this way and that , and very soon were sleeping .
melville	moby	chapter 31 . queen mab . next morning stubb accosted flask . “ such a queer dream , king-post , i never had . you know the old man ’ s ivory leg , well i dreamed he kicked me with it ; and when i tried to kick back , upon my soul , my little man , i kicked my leg right off ! and then , presto ! ahab seemed a pyramid , and i , like a blazing fool , kept kicking at it . but what was still more curious , flask—you know how curious all dreams are—through all this rage that i was in , i somehow seemed to be thinking to myself , that after all , it was not much of an insult , that kick from ahab . ‘ why , ’ thinks i , ‘ what ’ s the row ? it ’ s not a real leg , only a false leg. ’ and there ’ s a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump . that ’ s what makes a blow from the hand , flask , fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane . the living member—that makes the living insult , my little man . and thinks i to myself all the while , mind , while i was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramid—so confoundedly contradictory was it all , all the while , i say , i was thinking to myself , ‘ what ’ s his leg now , but a cane—a whalebone cane . yes , ’ thinks i , ‘ it was only a playful cudgelling—in fact , only a whaleboning that he gave me—not a base kick . besides , ’ thinks i , ‘ look at it once ; why , the end of it—the foot part—what a small sort of end it is ; whereas , if a broad footed farmer kicked me , _there ’ s_ a devilish broad insult . but this insult is whittled down to a point only. ’ but now comes the greatest joke of the dream , flask . while i was battering away at the pyramid , a sort of badger-haired old merman , with a hump on his back , takes me by the shoulders , and slews me round . ‘ what are you ’ bout ? ’ says he . slid ! man , but i was frightened . such a phiz ! but , somehow , next moment i was over the fright . ‘ what am i about ? ’ says i at last . ‘ and what business is that of yours , i should like to know , mr. humpback ? do _you_ want a kick ? ’ by the lord , flask , i had no sooner said that , than he turned round his stern to me , bent over , and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a clout—what do you think , i saw ? —why thunder alive , man , his stern was stuck full of marlinspikes , with the points out . says i , on second thoughts , ‘ i guess i won ’ t kick you , old fellow. ’ ‘ wise stubb , ’ said he , ‘ wise stubb ; ’ and kept muttering it all the time , a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag . seeing he wasn ’ t going to stop saying over his ‘ wise stubb , wise stubb , ’ i thought i might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again . but i had only just lifted my foot for it , when he roared out , ‘ stop that kicking ! ’ ‘ halloa , ’ says i , ‘ what ’ s the matter now , old fellow ? ’ ‘ look ye here , ’ says he ; ‘ let ’ s argue the insult . captain ahab kicked ye , didn ’ t he ? ’ ‘ yes , he did , ’ says i— ‘ right _here_ it was. ’ ‘ very good , ’ says he— ‘ he used his ivory leg , didn ’ t he ? ’ ‘ yes , he did , ’ says i . ‘ well then , ’ says he , ‘ wise stubb , what have you to complain of ? didn ’ t he kick with right good will ? it wasn ’ t a common pitch pine leg he kicked with , was it ? no , you were kicked by a great man , and with a beautiful ivory leg , stubb . it ’ s an honor ; i consider it an honor . listen , wise stubb . in old england the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen , and made garter-knights of ; but , be _your_ boast , stubb , that ye were kicked by old ahab , and made a wise man of . remember what i say ; _be_ kicked by him ; account his kicks honors ; and on no account kick back ; for you can ’ t help yourself , wise stubb . don ’ t you see that pyramid ? ’ with that , he all of a sudden seemed somehow , in some queer fashion , to swim off into the air . i snored ; rolled over ; and there i was in my hammock ! now , what do you think of that dream , flask ? ”
melville	moby	“ well , captain bildad , ” interrupted peleg , “ what d ’ ye say , what lay shall we give this young man ? ” “ thou knowest best , ” was the sepulchral reply , “ the seven hundred and seventy-seventh wouldn ’ t be too much , would it ? — ‘ where moth and rust do corrupt , but _lay_— ’ ”
melville	moby	“ ‘ how ? how ? ’ cried all the young spaniards , crowding . “ ‘ nay , dons , dons—nay , nay ! i can not rehearse that now . let me get more into the air , sirs. ’ “ ‘ the chicha ! the chicha ! ’ cried don pedro ; ‘ our vigorous friend looks faint ; —fill up his empty glass ! ’
melville	moby	but when three or four days had slided by , after meeting the children-seeking rachel ; and no spout had yet been seen ; the monomaniac old man seemed distrustful of his crew ’ s fidelity ; at least , of nearly all except the pagan harpooneers ; he seemed to doubt , even , whether stubb and flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought . but if these suspicions were really his , he sagaciously refrained from verbally expressing them , however his actions might seem to hint them .
melville	moby	“ ‘ will you be so good as to bring the priest also , don ? ’ “ ‘ though there are no auto-da-fés in lima now , ’ said one of the company to another ; ‘ i fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy . let us withdraw more out of the moonlight . i see no need of this . ’
melville	moby	now , the captain d ’ wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in question , is a new englander , who , after a long life of unusual adventures as a sea-captain , this day resides in the village of dorchester near boston . i have the honor of being a nephew of his . i have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in langsdorff . he substantiates every word . the ship , however , was by no means a large one : a russian craft built on the siberian coast , and purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home .
melville	moby	for some time past , though at intervals only , the unaccompanied , secluded white whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly frequented by the sperm whale fishermen . but not all of them knew of his existence ; only a few of them , comparatively , had knowingly seen him ; while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given battle to him , was small indeed . for , owing to the large number of whale-cruisers ; the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire watery circumference , many of them adventurously pushing their quest along solitary latitudes , so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth or more on a stretch , to encounter a single news-telling sail of any sort ; the inordinate length of each separate voyage ; the irregularity of the times of sailing from home ; all these , with other circumstances , direct and indirect , long obstructed the spread through the whole world-wide whaling-fleet of the special individualizing tidings concerning moby dick . it was hardly to be doubted , that several vessels reported to have encountered , at such or such a time , or on such or such a meridian , a sperm whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity , which whale , after doing great mischief to his assailants , had completely escaped them ; to some minds it was not an unfair presumption , i say , that the whale in question must have been no other than moby dick . yet as of late the sperm whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity , cunning , and malice in the monster attacked ; therefore it was , that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle to moby dick ; such hunters , perhaps , for the most part , were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred , more , as it were , to the perils of the sperm whale fishery at large , than to the individual cause . in that way , mostly , the disastrous encounter between ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded .
melville	moby	in one of those southern whalesmen , on a long three or four years ’ voyage , as often happens , the sum of the various hours you spend at the mast-head would amount to several entire months . and it is much to be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural life , should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness , or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling , such as pertains to a bed , a hammock , a hearse , a sentry box , a pulpit , a coach , or any other of those small and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves . your most usual point of perch is the head of the t ’ gallant-mast , where you stand upon two thin parallel sticks ( almost peculiar to whalemen ) called the t ’ gallant cross-trees . here , tossed about by the sea , the beginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull ’ s horns . to be sure , in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you , in the shape of a watch-coat ; but properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more of a house than the unclad body ; for as the soul is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle , and can not freely move about in it , nor even move out of it , without running great risk of perishing ( like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy alps in winter ) ; so a watch-coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope , or additional skin encasing you . you can not put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body , and no more can you make a convenient closet of your watch-coat .
melville	moby	it was far down the afternoon ; and when all the spearings of the crimson fight were done : and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky , sun and whale both stilly died together ; then , such a sweetness and such plaintiveness , such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy air , that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent valleys of the manilla isles , the spanish land-breeze , wantonly turned sailor , had gone to sea , freighted with these vesper hymns .
melville	moby	he ate in the same open air ; that is , his two only meals , —breakfast and dinner : supper he never touched ; nor reaped his beard ; which darkly grew all gnarled , as unearthed roots of trees blown over , which still grow idly on at naked base , though perished in the upper verdure . but though his whole life was now become one watch on deck ; and though the parsee ’ s mystic watch was without intermission as his own ; yet these two never seemed to speak—one man to the other—unless at long intervals some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary . though such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the twain ; openly , and to the awe-struck crew , they seemed pole-like asunder . if by day they chanced to speak one word ; by night , dumb men were both , so far as concerned the slightest verbal interchange . at times , for longest hours , without a single hail , they stood far parted in the starlight ; ahab in his scuttle , the parsee by the mainmast ; but still fixedly gazing upon each other ; as if in the parsee ahab saw his forethrown shadow , in ahab the parsee his abandoned substance .
melville	moby	soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist ; neither ship nor boat to be seen . “ give way , men , ” whispered starbuck , drawing still further aft the sheet of his sail ; “ there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes . there ’ s white water again ! —close to ! spring ! ”
melville	moby	with much interest i sat watching him . savage though he was , and hideously marred about the face—at least to my taste—his countenance yet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable . you can not hide the soul . through all his unearthly tattooings , i thought i saw the traces of a simple honest heart ; and in his large , deep eyes , fiery black and bold , there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils . and besides all this , there was a certain lofty bearing about the pagan , which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim . he looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a creditor . whether it was , too , that his head being shaved , his forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief , and looked more expansive than it otherwise would , this i will not venture to decide ; but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent one . it may seem ridiculous , but it reminded me of general washington ’ s head , as seen in the popular busts of him . it had the same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows , which were likewise very projecting , like two long promontories thickly wooded on top . queequeg was george washington cannibalistically developed .

melville	moby	thus much being said , attend now , i pray you , to that marvellous and—in this particular instance—almost fatal operation whereby the sperm whale ’ s great heidelburgh tun is tapped . chapter 78 . cistern and buckets .
melville	moby	nor was this long wanting . tall spouts were seen to leeward ; and two boats , stubb ’ s and flask ’ s , were detached in pursuit . pulling further and further away , they at last became almost invisible to the men at the mast-head . but suddenly in the distance , they saw a great heap of tumultuous white water , and soon after news came from aloft that one or both the boats must be fast . an interval passed and the boats were in plain sight , in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the towing whale . so close did the monster come to the hull , that at first it seemed as if he meant it malice ; but suddenly going down in a maelstrom , within three rods of the planks , he wholly disappeared from view , as if diving under the keel . “ cut , cut ! ” was the cry from the ship to the boats , which , for one instant , seemed on the point of being brought with a deadly dash against the vessel ’ s side . but having plenty of line yet in the tubs , and the whale not sounding very rapidly , they paid out abundance of rope , and at the same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship . for a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical ; for while they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction , and still plied their oars in another , the contending strain threatened to take them under . but it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain . and they stuck to it till they did gain it ; when instantly , a swift tremor was felt running like lightning along the keel , as the strained line , scraping beneath the ship , suddenly rose to view under her bows , snapping and quivering ; and so flinging off its drippings , that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water , while the whale beyond also rose to sight , and once more the boats were free to fly . but the fagged whale abated his speed , and blindly altering his course , went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after him , so that they performed a complete circuit .
melville	moby	look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was settled by the red-men . thus goes the legend . in olden times an eagle swooped down upon the new england coast , and carried off an infant indian in his talons . with loud lament the parents saw their child borne out of sight over the wide waters . they resolved to follow in the same direction . setting out in their canoes , after a perilous passage they discovered the island , and there they found an empty ivory casket , —the poor little indian ’ s skeleton .
melville	moby	“ hold on , hold on , won ’ t ye ? ” cried stubb to the body , “ don ’ t be in such a devil of a hurry to sink ! by thunder , men , we must do something or go for it . no use prying there ; avast , i say with your handspikes , and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife , and cut the big chains . ”
melville	moby	and thus , while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze , the other stubbornly fought against it ; and so the two vessels parted ; the crew of the pequod looking with grave , lingering glances towards the receding bachelor ; but the bachelor ’ s men never heeding their gaze for the lively revelry they were in . and as ahab , leaning over the taffrail , eyed the homeward-bound craft , he took from his pocket a small vial of sand , and then looking from the ship to the vial , seemed thereby bringing two remote associations together , for that vial was filled with nantucket soundings .

melville	moby	but , though these barbarians dined in the cabin , and nominally lived there ; still , being anything but sedentary in their habits , they were scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes , and just before sleeping-time , when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters .
melville	moby	we borrowed a wheelbarrow , and embarking our things , including my own poor carpet-bag , and queequeg ’ s canvas sack and hammock , away we went down to “ the moss , ” the little nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf . as we were going along the people stared ; not at queequeg so much—for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their streets , —but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms . but we heeded them not , going along wheeling the barrow by turns , and queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs . i asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore , and whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons . to this , in substance , he replied , that though what i hinted was true enough , yet he had a particular affection for his own harpoon , because it was of assured stuff , well tried in many a mortal combat , and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales . in short , like many inland reapers and mowers , who go into the farmers ’ meadows armed with their own scythes—though in no wise obliged to furnish them—even so , queequeg , for his own private reasons , preferred his own harpoon .
melville	moby	but this is not the half ; look again . i freely assert , that the cosmopolite philosopher can not , for his life , point out one single peaceful influence , which within the last sixty years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world , taken in one aggregate , than the high and mighty business of whaling . one way and another , it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves , and so continuously momentous in their sequential issues , that whaling may well be regarded as that egyptian mother , who bore offspring themselves pregnant from her womb . it would be a hopeless , endless task to catalogue all these things . let a handful suffice . for many years past the whale-ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and least known parts of the earth . she has explored seas and archipelagoes which had no chart , where no cook or vancouver had ever sailed . if american and european men-of-war now peacefully ride in once savage harbors , let them fire salutes to the honor and glory of the whale-ship , which originally showed them the way , and first interpreted between them and the savages . they may celebrate as they will the heroes of exploring expeditions , your cooks , your krusensterns ; but i say that scores of anonymous captains have sailed out of nantucket , that were as great , and greater than your cook and your krusenstern . for in their succourless empty-handedness , they , in the heathenish sharked waters , and by the beaches of unrecorded , javelin islands , battled with virgin wonders and terrors that cook with all his marines and muskets would not willingly have dared . all that is made such a flourish of in the old south sea voyages , those things were but the life-time commonplaces of our heroic nantucketers . often , adventures which vancouver dedicates three chapters to , these men accounted unworthy of being set down in the ship ’ s common log . ah , the world ! oh , the world !
melville	moby	“ queequeg , ” said i , when they had dragged me , the last man , to the deck , and i was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water ; “ queequeg , my fine friend , does this sort of thing often happen ? ” without much emotion , though soaked through just like me , he gave me to understand that such things did often happen .

melville	moby	poor queequeg ! when the ship was about half disembowelled , you should have stooped over the hatchway , and peered down upon him there ; where , stripped to his woollen drawers , the tattooed savage was crawling about amid that dampness and slime , like a green spotted lizard at the bottom of a well . and a well , or an ice-house , it somehow proved to him , poor pagan ; where , strange to say , for all the heat of his sweatings , he caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever ; and at last , after some days ’ suffering , laid him in his hammock , close to the very sill of the door of death . how he wasted and wasted away in those few long-lingering days , till there seemed but little left of him but his frame and tattooing . but as all else in him thinned , and his cheek-bones grew sharper , his eyes , nevertheless , seemed growing fuller and fuller ; they became of a strange softness of lustre ; and mildly but deeply looked out at you there from his sickness , a wondrous testimony to that immortal health in him which could not die , or be weakened . and like circles on the water , which , as they grow fainter , expand ; so his eyes seemed rounding and rounding , like the rings of eternity . an awe that can not be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of this waning savage , and saw as strange things in his face , as any beheld who were bystanders when zoroaster died . for whatever is truly wondrous and fearful in man , never yet was put into words or books . and the drawing near of death , which alike levels all , alike impresses all with a last revelation , which only an author from the dead could adequately tell . so that—let us say it again—no dying chaldee or greek had higher and holier thoughts than those , whose mysterious shades you saw creeping over the face of poor queequeg , as he quietly lay in his swaying hammock , and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his final rest , and the ocean ’ s invisible flood-tide lifted him higher and higher towards his destined heaven .

melville	moby	[ _a burst of revelry from the forecastle_ . ] oh , god ! to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch of human mothers in them ! whelped somewhere by the sharkish sea . the white whale is their demigorgon . hark ! the infernal orgies ! that revelry is forward ! mark the unfaltering silence aft ! methinks it pictures life . foremost through the sparkling sea shoots on the gay , embattled , bantering bow , but only to drag dark ahab after it , where he broods within his sternward cabin , builded over the dead water of the wake , and further on , hunted by its wolfish gurglings . the long howl thrills me through ! peace ! ye revellers , and set the watch ! oh , life ! ’ tis in an hour like this , with soul beat down and held to knowledge , —as wild , untutored things are forced to feed—oh , life ! ’ tis now that i do feel the latent horror in thee ! but ’ tis not me ! that horror ’ s out of me ! and with the soft feeling of the human in me , yet will i try to fight ye , ye grim , phantom futures ! stand by me , hold me , bind me , o ye blessed influences !
melville	typee	the trees are stripped of their nodding burdens , which , easily freed from the rind and core , are gathered together in capacious wooden vessels , where the pulpy fruit is soon worked by a stone pestle , vigorously applied , into a blended mass of a doughy consistency , called by the natives ‘ tutao ’ . this is then divided into separate parcels , which , after being made up into stout packages , enveloped in successive folds of leaves , and bound round with thongs of bark , are stored away in large receptacles hollowed in the earth , from whence they are drawn as occasion may require . in this condition the tutao sometimes remains for years , and even is thought to improve by age . before it is fit to be eaten , however , it has to undergo an additional process . a primitive oven is scooped in the ground , and its bottom being loosely covered with stones , a large fire is kindled within it . as soon as the requisite degree of heat is attained , the embers are removed , and the surface of the stones being covered with thick layers of leaves , one of the large packages of tutao is deposited upon them and overspread with another layer of leaves . the whole is then quickly heaped up with earth , and forms a sloping mound .
melville	typee	the tutao thus baked is called ‘ amar ’ ; the action of the oven having converted it into an amber-coloured caky substance , a little tart , but not at all disagreeable to the taste .
melville	typee	by another and final process the ‘ amar ’ is changed into ‘ poee-poee ’ . this transition is rapidly effected . the amar is placed in a vessel , and mixed with water until it gains a proper pudding-like consistency , when , without further preparation , it is in readiness for use . this is the form in which the ‘ tutao ’ is generally consumed . the singular mode of eating it i have already described .
melville	typee	were it not that the bread-fruit is thus capable of being preserved for a length of time , the natives might be reduced to a state of starvation ; for owing to some unknown cause the trees sometimes fail to bear fruit ; and on such occasions the islanders chiefly depend upon the supplies they have been enabled to store away .
melville	typee	this stately tree , which is rarely met with upon the sandwich islands , and then only of a very inferior quality , and at tahiti does not abound to a degree that renders its fruit the principal article of food , attains its greatest excellence in the genial climate of the marquesan group , where it grows to an enormous magnitude , and flourishes in the utmost abundance .
melville	typee	chapter sixteen melancholy condition -- occurrence at the ti -- anecdote of marheyo -- shaving the head of a warrior in looking back to this period , and calling to remembrance the numberless proofs of kindness and respect which i received from the natives of the valley , i can scarcely understand how it was that , in the midst of so many consolatory circumstances , my mind should still have been consumed by the most dismal forebodings , and have remained a prey to the profoundest melancholy . it is true that the suspicious circumstances which had attended the disappearance of toby were enough of themselves to excite distrust with regard to the savages , in whose power i felt myself to be entirely placed , especially when it was combined with the knowledge that these very men , kind and respectful as they were to me , were , after all , nothing better than a set of cannibals .
melville	typee	but my chief source of anxiety , and that which poisoned every temporary enjoyment , was the mysterious disease in my leg , which still remained unabated . all the herbal applications of tinor , united with the severer discipline of the old leech , and the affectionate nursing of kory-kory , had failed to relieve me . i was almost a cripple , and the pain i endured at intervals was agonizing . the unaccountable malady showed no signs of amendment : on the contrary , its violence increased day by day , and threatened the most fatal results , unless some powerful means were employed to counteract it . it seemed as if i were destined to sink under this grievous affliction , or at least that it would hinder me from availing myself of any opportunity of escaping from the valley .
melville	typee	an incident which occurred as nearly as i can estimate about three weeks after the disappearance of toby , convinced me that the natives , from some reason or other , would interpose every possible obstacle to my leaving them .
melville	typee	one morning there was no little excitement evinced by the people near my abode , and which i soon discovered proceeded from a vague report that boats , had been seen at a great distance approaching the bay . immediately all was bustle and animation . it so happened that day that the pain i suffered having somewhat abated , and feeling in much better spirits than usual , i had complied with kory-kory ’ s invitation to visit the chief mehevi at the place called the ‘ ti ’ , which i have before described as being situated within the precincts of the taboo groves . these sacred recesses were at no great distance from marheyo ’ s habitation , and lay between it and the sea ; the path that conducted to the beach passing directly in front of the ti , and thence skirting along the border of the groves .
melville	typee	i was reposing upon the mats , within the sacred building , in company with mehevi and several other chiefs , when the announcement was first made . it sent a thrill of joy through my whole frame ; -- perhaps toby was about to return . i rose at once to my feet , and my instinctive impulse was to hurry down to the beach , equally regardless of the distance that separated me from it , and of my disabled condition . as soon as mehevi noticed the effect the intelligence had produced upon me , and the impatience i betrayed to reach the sea , his countenance assumed that inflexible rigidity of expression which had so awed me on the afternoon of our arrival at the house of marheyo . as i was proceeding to leave the ti , he laid his hand upon my shoulder , and said gravely , ‘ abo , abo ’ ( wait , wait ) . solely intent upon the one thought that occupied my mind , and heedless of his request , i was brushing past him , when suddenly he assumed a tone of authority , and told me to ‘ moee ’ ( sit down ) . though struck by the alteration in his demeanour , the excitement under which i laboured was too strong to permit me to obey the unexpected command , and i was still limping towards the edge of the pi-pi with kory-kory clinging to one arm in his efforts to restrain me , when the natives around started to their feet , ranged themselves along the open front of the building , while mehevi looked at me scowlingly , and reiterated his commands still more sternly .
melville	typee	it was at this moment , when fifty savage countenances were glaring upon me , that i first truly experienced i was indeed a captive in the valley . the conviction rushed upon me with staggering force , and i was overwhelmed by this confirmation of my worst fears . i saw at once that it was useless for me to resist , and sick at heart , i reseated myself upon the mats , and for the moment abandoned myself to despair .
melville	typee	i now perceived the natives one after the other hurrying past the ti and pursuing the route that conducted to the sea . these savages , thought i , will soon be holding communication with some of my own countrymen perhaps , who with ease could restore me to liberty did they know of the situation i was in . no language can describe the wretchedness which i felt ; and in the bitterness of my soul i imprecated a thousand curses on the perfidious toby , who had thus abandoned me to destruction . it was in vain that kory-kory tempted me with food , or lighted my pipe , or sought to attract my attention by performing the uncouth antics that had sometimes diverted me . i was fairly knocked down by this last misfortune , which , much as i had feared it , i had never before had the courage calmly to contemplate .
melville	typee	regardless of everything but my own sorrow , i remained in the ti for several hours , until shouts proceeding at intervals from the groves beyond the house proclaimed the return of the natives from the beach .
melville	typee	whether any boats visited the bay that morning or not , i never could ascertain . the savages assured me that there had not -- but i was inclined to believe that by deceiving me in this particular they sought to allay the violence of my grief . however that might be , this incident showed plainly that the typees intended to hold me a prisoner . as they still treated me with the same sedulous attention as before , i was utterly at a loss how to account for their singular conduct . had i been in a situation to instruct them in any of the rudiments of the mechanic arts , or had i manifested a disposition to render myself in any way useful among them , their conduct might have been attributed to some adequate motive , but as it was , the matter seemed to me inexplicable .
melville	typee	during my whole stay on the island there occurred but two or three instances where the natives applied to me with the view of availing themselves of my superior information ; and these now appear so ludicrous that i can not forbear relating them .
melville	typee	the few things we had brought from nukuheva had been done up into a small bundle which we had carried with us in our descent to the valley . this bundle , the first night of our arrival , i had used as a pillow , but on the succeeding morning , opening it for the inspection of the natives , they gazed upon the miscellaneous contents as though i had just revealed to them a casket of diamonds , and they insisted that so precious a treasure should be properly secured . a line was accordingly attached to it , and the other end being passed over the ridge-pole of the house , it was hoisted up to the apex of the roof , where it hung suspended directly over the mats where i usually reclined . when i desired anything from it i merely raised my finger to a bamboo beside me , and taking hold of the string which was there fastened , lowered the package . this was exceedingly handy , and i took care to let the natives understand how much i applauded the invention . of this package the chief contents were a razor with its case , a supply of needles and thread , a pound or two of tobacco and a few yards of bright-coloured calico .
melville	typee	i should have mentioned that shortly after toby ’ s disappearance , perceiving the uncertainty of the time i might be obliged to remain in the valley -- if , indeed , i ever should escape from it -- and considering that my whole wardrobe consisted of a shirt and a pair of trousers , i resolved to doff these garments at once , in order to preserve them in a suitable condition for wear should i again appear among civilized beings . i was consequently obliged to assume the typee costume , a little altered , however , to suit my own views of propriety , and in which i have no doubt i appeared to as much advantage as a senator of rome enveloped in the folds of his toga . a few folds of yellow tappa tucked about my waist , descended to my feet in the style of a lady ’ s petticoat , only i did not have recourse to those voluminous paddings in the rear with which our gentle dames are in the habit of augmenting the sublime rotundity of their figures . this usually comprised my in-door dress ; whenever i walked out , i superadded to it an ample robe of the same material , which completely enveloped my person , and screened it from the rays of the sun .
melville	typee	one morning i made a rent in this mantle ; and to show the islanders with what facility it could be repaired , i lowered my bundle , and taking from it a needle and thread , proceeded to stitch up the opening . they regarded this wonderful application of science with intense admiration ; and whilst i was stitching away , old marheyo , who was one of the lookers-on , suddenly clapped his hand to his forehead , and rushing to a corner of the house , drew forth a soiled and tattered strip of faded calico which he must have procured some time or other in traffic on the beach -- and besought me eagerly to exercise a little of my art upon it . i willingly complied , though certainly so stumpy a needle as mine never took such gigantic strides over calico before . the repairs completed , old marheyo gave me a paternal hug ; and divesting himself of his ‘ maro ’ ( girdle ) , swathed the calico about his loins , and slipping the beloved ornaments into his ears , grasped his spear and sallied out of the house , like a valiant templar arrayed in a new and costly suit of armour .
melville	typee	i never used my razor during my stay in the island , but although a very subordinate affair , it had been vastly admired by the typees ; and narmonee , a great hero among them , who was exceedingly precise in the arrangements of his toilet and the general adjustment of is person , being the most accurately tattooed and laboriously horrified individual in all the valley , thought it would be a great advantage to have it applied to the already shaven crown of his head .
melville	typee	the implement they usually employ is a shark ’ s tooth , which is about as well adapted to the purpose as a one-pronged fork for pitching hay . no wonder , then , that the acute narmonee perceived the advantage my razor possessed over the usual implement . accordingly , one day he requested as a personal favour that i would just run over his head with the razor . in reply , i gave him to understand that it was too dull , and could not be used to any purpose without being previously sharpened . to assist my meaning , i went through an imaginary honing process on the palm of my hand . narmonee took my meaning in an instant , and running out of the house , returned the next moment with a huge rough mass of rock as big as a millstone , and indicated to me that that was exactly the thing i wanted . of course there was nothing left for me but to proceed to business , and i began scraping away at a great rate . he writhed and wriggled under the infliction , but , fully convinced of my skill , endured the pain like a martyr .
melville	typee	though i never saw narmonee in battle i will , from what i then observed , stake my life upon his courage and fortitude . before commencing operations , his head had presented a surface of short bristling hairs , and by the time i had concluded my unskilful operation it resembled not a little a stubble field after being gone over with a harrow . however , as the chief expressed the liveliest satisfaction at the result , i was too wise to dissent from his opinion .
melville	typee	chapter seventeen improvement in health and spirits -- felicity of the typees -- their enjoyments compared with those of more enlightened communities -- comparative wickedness of civilized and unenlightened people -- a skirmish in the mountain with the warriors of happar
melville	typee	day after day wore on , and still there was no perceptible change in the conduct of the islanders towards me . gradually i lost all knowledge of the regular recurrence of the days of the week , and sunk insensibly into that kind of apathy which ensues after some violent outburst of despair . my limb suddenly healed , the swelling went down , the pain subsided , and i had every reason to suppose i should soon completely recover from the affliction that had so long tormented me .
melville	typee	as soon as i was enabled to ramble about the valley in company with the natives , troops of whom followed me whenever i sallied out of the house , i began to experience an elasticity of mind which placed me beyond the reach of those dismal forebodings to which i had so lately been a prey . received wherever i went with the most deferential kindness ; regaled perpetually with the most delightful fruits ; ministered to by dark-eyed nymphs , and enjoying besides all the services of the devoted kory-kory , i thought that , for a sojourn among cannibals , no man could have well made a more agreeable one .
melville	typee	to be sure there were limits set to my wanderings . toward the sea my progress was barred by an express prohibition of the savages ; and after having made two or three ineffectual attempts to reach it , as much to gratify my curiosity as anything else , i gave up the idea . it was in vain to think of reaching it by stealth , since the natives escorted me in numbers wherever i went , and not for one single moment that i can recall to mind was i ever permitted to be alone .
melville	typee	the green and precipitous elevations that stood ranged around the head of the vale where marheyo ’ s habitation was situated effectually precluded all hope of escape in that quarter , even if i could have stolen away from the thousand eyes of the savages .
melville	typee	but these reflections now seldom obtruded upon me ; i gave myself up to the passing hour , and if ever disagreeable thoughts arose in my mind , i drove them away . when i looked around the verdant recess in which i was buried , and gazed up to the summits of the lofty eminence that hemmed me in , i was well disposed to think that i was in the ‘ happy valley ’ , and that beyond those heights there was naught but a world of care and anxiety . as i extended my wanderings in the valley and grew more familiar with the habits of its inmates , i was fain to confess that , despite the disadvantages of his condition , the polynesian savage , surrounded by all the luxurious provisions of nature , enjoyed an infinitely happier , though certainly a less intellectual existence than the self-complacent european .
melville	typee	the naked wretch who shivers beneath the bleak skies , and starves among the inhospitable wilds of tierra-del-fuego , might indeed be made happier by civilization , for it would alleviate his physical wants . but the voluptuous indian , with every desire supplied , whom providence has bountifully provided with all the sources of pure and natural enjoyment , and from whom are removed so many of the ills and pains of life -- what has he to desire at the hands of civilization ? she may ‘ cultivate his mind -- may elevate his thoughts , ’ -- these i believe are the established phrases -- but will he be the happier ? let the once smiling and populous hawaiian islands , with their now diseased , starving , and dying natives , answer the question . the missionaries may seek to disguise the matter as they will , but the facts are incontrovertible ; and the devoutest christian who visits that group with an unbiased mind , must go away mournfully asking -- ‘ are these , alas ! the fruits of twenty-five years of enlightening ? ’
melville	typee	in a primitive state of society , the enjoyments of life , though few and simple , are spread over a great extent , and are unalloyed ; but civilization , for every advantage she imparts , holds a hundred evils in reserve ; -- the heart-burnings , the jealousies , the social rivalries , the family dissentions , and the thousand self-inflicted discomforts of refined life , which make up in units the swelling aggregate of human misery , are unknown among these unsophisticated people .
melville	typee	but it will be urged that these shocking unprincipled wretches are cannibals . very true ; and a rather bad trait in their character it must be allowed . but they are such only when they seek to gratify the passion of revenge upon their enemies ; and i ask whether the mere eating of human flesh so very far exceeds in barbarity that custom which only a few years since was practised in enlightened england : -- a convicted traitor , perhaps a man found guilty of honesty , patriotism , and suchlike heinous crimes , had his head lopped off with a huge axe , his bowels dragged out and thrown into a fire ; while his body , carved into four quarters , was with his head exposed upon pikes , and permitted to rot and fester among the public haunts of men !
melville	typee	the fiend-like skill we display in the invention of all manner of death-dealing engines , the vindictiveness with which we carry on our wars , and the misery and desolation that follow in their train , are enough of themselves to distinguish the white civilized man as the most ferocious animal on the face of the earth .
melville	typee	his remorseless cruelty is seen in many of the institutions of our own favoured land . there is one in particular lately adopted in one of the states of the union , which purports to have been dictated by the most merciful considerations . to destroy our malefactors piece-meal , drying up in their veins , drop by drop , the blood we are too chicken-hearted to shed by a single blow which would at once put a period to their sufferings , is deemed to be infinitely preferable to the old-fashioned punishment of gibbeting -- much less annoying to the victim , and more in accordance with the refined spirit of the age ; and yet how feeble is all language to describe the horrors we inflict upon these wretches , whom we mason up in the cells of our prisons , and condemn to perpetual solitude in the very heart of our population .
melville	typee	but it is needless to multiply the examples of civilized barbarity ; they far exceed in the amount of misery they cause the crimes which we regard with such abhorrence in our less enlightened fellow-creatures .
melville	typee	the term ‘ savage ’ is , i conceive , often misapplied , and indeed , when i consider the vices , cruelties , and enormities of every kind that spring up in the tainted atmosphere of a feverish civilization , i am inclined to think that so far as the relative wickedness of the parties is concerned , four or five marquesan islanders sent to the united states as missionaries might be quite as useful as an equal number of americans despatched to the islands in a similar capacity .
melville	typee	i once heard it given as an instance of the frightful depravity of a certain tribe in the pacific that they had no word in their language to express the idea of virtue . the assertion was unfounded ; but were it otherwise , it might be met by stating that their language is almost entirely destitute of terms to express the delightful ideas conveyed by our endless catalogue of civilized crimes .
melville	typee	in the altered frame of mind to which i have referred , every object that presented itself to my notice in the valley struck me in a new light , and the opportunities i now enjoyed of observing the manners of its inmates , tended to strengthen my favourable impressions . one peculiarity that fixed my admiration was the perpetual hilarity reigning through the whole extent of the vale .
melville	typee	there seemed to be no cares , griefs , troubles , or vexations , in all typee . the hours tripped along as gaily as the laughing couples down a country dance . there were none of those thousand sources of irritation that the ingenuity of civilized man has created to mar his own felicity . there were no foreclosures of mortgages , no protested notes , no bills payable , no debts of honour in typee ; no unreasonable tailors and shoemakers perversely bent on being paid ; no duns of any description and battery attorneys , to foment discord , backing their clients up to a quarrel , and then knocking their heads together ; no poor relations , everlastingly occupying the spare bed-chamber , and diminishing the elbow room at the family table ; no destitute widows with their children starving on the cold charities of the world ; no beggars ; no debtors ’ prisons ; no proud and hard-hearted nabobs in typee ; or to sum up all in one word -- no money ! ‘ that root of all evil ’ was not to be found in the valley .
melville	typee	in this secluded abode of happiness there were no cross old women , no cruel step-dames , no withered spinsters , no lovesick maidens , no sour old bachelors , no inattentive husbands , no melancholy young men , no blubbering youngsters , and no squalling brats . all was mirth , fun and high good humour . blue devils , hypochondria , and doleful dumps , went and hid themselves among the nooks and crannies of the rocks .
melville	typee	here you would see a parcel of children frolicking together the live-long day , and no quarrelling , no contention , among them . the same number in our own land could not have played together for the space of an hour without biting or scratching one another . there you might have seen a throng of young females , not filled with envyings of each other ’ s charms , nor displaying the ridiculous affectations of gentility , nor yet moving in whalebone corsets , like so many automatons , but free , inartificially happy , and unconstrained .
melville	typee	there were some spots in that sunny vale where they would frequently resort to decorate themselves with garlands of flowers . to have seen them reclining beneath the shadows of one of the beautiful groves ; the ground about them strewn with freshly gathered buds and blossoms , employed in weaving chaplets and necklaces , one would have thought that all the train of flora had gathered together to keep a festival in honour of their mistress .
melville	typee	with the young men there seemed almost always some matter of diversion or business on hand that afforded a constant variety of enjoyment . but whether fishing , or carving canoes , or polishing their ornaments , never was there exhibited the least sign of strife or contention among them . as for the warriors , they maintained a tranquil dignity of demeanour , journeying occasionally from house to house , where they were always sure to be received with the attention bestowed upon distinguished guests . the old men , of whom there were many in the vale , seldom stirred from their mats , where they would recline for hours and hours , smoking and talking to one another with all the garrulity of age .
melville	typee	but the continual happiness , which so far as i was able to judge appeared to prevail in the valley , sprang principally from that all-pervading sensation which rousseau has told us be at one time experienced , the mere buoyant sense of a healthful physical existence . and indeed in this particular the typees had ample reason to felicitate themselves , for sickness was almost unknown . during the whole period of my stay i saw but one invalid among them ; and on their smooth skins you observed no blemish or mark of disease .
melville	typee	the general repose , however , upon which i have just been descanting , was broken in upon about this time by an event which proved that the islanders were not entirely exempt from those occurrences which disturb the quiet of more civilized communities .
melville	typee	having now been a considerable time in the valley , i began to feel surprised that the violent hostility subsisting between its inhabitants , and those of the adjoining bay of happar , should never have manifested itself in any warlike encounter . although the valiant typees would often by gesticulations declare their undying hatred against their enemies , and the disgust they felt at their cannibal propensities ; although they dilated upon the manifold injuries they had received at their hands , yet with a forbearance truly commendable , they appeared to sit down under their grievances , and to refrain from making any reprisals . the happars , entrenched behind their mountains , and never even showing themselves on their summits , did not appear to me to furnish adequate cause for that excess of animosity evinced towards them by the heroic tenants of our vale , and i was inclined to believe that the deeds of blood attributed to them had been greatly exaggerated .
melville	typee	on the other hand , as the clamours of war had not up to this period disturbed the serenity of the tribe , i began to distrust the truth of those reports which ascribed so fierce and belligerent a character to the typee nation . surely , thought i , all these terrible stories i have heard about the inveteracy with which they carried on the feud , their deadly intensity , of hatred and the diabolical malice with which they glutted their revenge upon the inanimate forms of the slain , are nothing more than fables , and i must confess that i experienced something like a sense of regret at having my hideous anticipations thus disappointed . i felt in some sort like a ‘ prentice boy who , going to the play in the expectation of being delighted with a cut-and-thrust tragedy , is almost moved to tears of disappointment at the exhibition of a genteel comedy .
melville	typee	i could not avoid thinking that i had fallen in with a greatly traduced people , and i moralized not a little upon the disadvantage of having a bad name , which in this instance had given a tribe of savages , who were as pacific as so many lambkins , the reputation of a confederacy of giant-killers .
melville	typee	but subsequent events proved that i had been a little too premature in coming to this conclusion . one , day about noon , happening to be at the ti , i had lain down on the mats with several of the chiefs , and had gradually sunk into a most luxurious siesta , when i was awakened by a tremendous outcry , and starting up beheld the natives seizing their spears and hurrying out , while the most puissant of the chiefs , grasping the six muskets which were ranged against the bamboos , followed after , and soon disappeared in the groves . these movements were accompanied by wild shouts , in which ‘ happar , happar , ’ greatly predominated . the islanders were now seen running past the ti , and striking across the valley to the happar side . presently i heard the sharp report of a musket from the adjoining hills , and then a burst of voices in the same direction . at this the women who had congregated in the groves , set up the most violent clamours , as they invariably do here as elsewhere on every occasion of excitement and alarm , with a view of tranquillizing their own minds and disturbing other people . on this particular occasion they made such an outrageous noise , and continued it with such perseverance , that for awhile , had entire volleys of musketry been fired off in the neighbouring mountains , i should not have been able to have heard them .
melville	typee	when this female commotion had a little subsided i listened eagerly for further information . at last bang went another shot , and then a second volley of yells from the hills . again all was quiet , and continued so for such a length of time that i began to think the contending armies had agreed upon a suspension of hostilities ; when pop went a third gun , followed as before with a yell . after this , for nearly two hours nothing occurred worthy of comment , save some straggling shouts from the hillside , sounding like the halloos of a parcel of truant boys who had lost themselves in the woods .
melville	typee	during this interval i had remained standing on the piazza of the ‘ ti , ’ which directly fronted the happar mountain , and with no one near me but kory-kory and the old superannuated savages i have described . these latter never stirred from their mats , and seemed altogether unconscious that anything unusual was going on .
melville	typee	as for kory-kory , he appeared to think that we were in the midst of great events , and sought most zealously to impress me with a due sense of their importance . every sound that reached us conveyed some momentous item of intelligence to him . at such times , as if he were gifted with second sight , he would go through a variety of pantomimic illustrations , showing me the precise manner in which the redoubtable typees were at that very moment chastising the insolence of the enemy . ‘ mehevi hanna pippee nuee happar , ’ he exclaimed every five minutes , giving me to understand that under that distinguished captain the warriors of his nation were performing prodigies of valour .
melville	typee	having heard only four reports from the muskets , i was led to believe that they were worked by the islanders in the same manner as the sultan solyman ’ s ponderous artillery at the siege of byzantium , one of them taking an hour or two to load and train . at last , no sound whatever proceeding from the mountains , i concluded that the contest had been determined one way or the other . such appeared , indeed , to be the case , for in a little while a courier arrived at the ‘ ti ’ , almost breathless with his exertions , and communicated the news of a great victory having been achieved by his countrymen : ‘ happar poo arva ! -- happar poo arva ! ’ ( the cowards had fled ) . kory-kory was in ecstasies , and commenced a vehement harangue , which , so far as i understood it , implied that the result exactly agreed with his expectations , and which , moreover , was intended to convince me that it would be a perfectly useless undertaking , even for an army of fire-eaters , to offer battle to the irresistible heroes of our valley . in all this i of course acquiesced , and looked forward with no little interest to the return of the conquerors , whose victory i feared might not have been purchased without cost to themselves .
melville	typee	but here i was again mistaken ; for mehevi , in conducting his warlike operations , rather inclined to the fabian than to the bonapartean tactics , husbanding his resources and exposing his troops to no unnecessary hazards . the total loss of the victors in this obstinately contested affair was , in killed , wounded , and missing -- one forefinger and part of a thumb-nail ( which the late proprietor brought along with him in his hand ) , a severely contused arm , and a considerable effusion of blood flowing from the thigh of a chief , who had received an ugly thrust from a happar spear . what the enemy had suffered i could not discover , but i presume they had succeeded in taking off with them the bodies of their slain .
melville	typee	such was the issue of the battle , as far as its results came under my observation : and as it appeared to be considered an event of prodigious importance , i reasonably concluded that the wars of the natives were marked by no very sanguinary traits . i afterwards learned how the skirmish had originated . a number of the happars had been discovered prowling for no good purpose on the typee side of the mountain ; the alarm sounded , and the invaders , after a protracted resistance , had been chased over the frontier . but why had not the intrepid mehevi carried the war into happar ? why had he not made a descent into the hostile vale , and brought away some trophy of his victory -- some materials for the cannibal entertainment which i had heard usually terminated every engagement ? after all , i was much inclined to believe that these shocking festivals must occur very rarely among the islanders , if , indeed , they ever take place .
melville	typee	for two or three days the late event was the theme of general comment ; after which the excitement gradually wore away , and the valley resumed its accustomed tranquility . chapter eighteen
melville	typee	swimming in company with the girls of the valley -- a canoe -- effects of the taboo -- a pleasure excursion on the pond -- beautiful freak of fayaway -- mantua-making -- a stranger arrives in the valley -- his mysterious conduct -- native oratory -- the interview -- its results -- departure of the stranger
melville	typee	returning health and peace of mind gave a new interest to everything around me . i sought to diversify my time by as many enjoyments as lay within my reach . bathing in company with troops of girls formed one of my chief amusements . we sometimes enjoyed the recreation in the waters of a miniature lake , to which the central stream of the valley expanded . this lovely sheet of water was almost circular in figure , and about three hundred yards across . its beauty was indescribable . all around its banks waved luxuriant masses of tropical foliage , soaring high above which were seen , here and there , the symmetrical shaft of the cocoanut tree , surmounted by its tufts of graceful branches , drooping in the air like so many waving ostrich plumes .
melville	typee	the ease and grace with which the maidens of the valley propelled themselves through the water , and their familiarity with the element , were truly astonishing . sometimes they might be seen gliding along just under the surface , without apparently moving hand or foot -- then throwing themselves on their sides , they darted through the water , revealing glimpses of their forms , as , in the course of their rapid progress , they shot for an instant partly into the air -- at one moment they dived deep down into the water , and the next they rose bounding to the surface .
melville	typee	i remember upon one occasion plunging in among a parcel of these river-nymphs , and counting vainly on my superior strength , sought to drag some of them under the water , but i quickly repented my temerity . the amphibious young creatures swarmed about me like a shoal of dolphins , and seizing hold of my devoted limbs , tumbled me about and ducked me under the surface , until from the strange noises which rang in my ears , and the supernatural visions dancing before my eyes , i thought i was in the land of the spirits . i stood indeed as little chance among them as a cumbrous whale attacked on all sides by a legion of swordfish . when at length they relinquished their hold of me , they swam away in every direction , laughing at my clumsy endeavours to reach them .
melville	typee	there was no boat on the lake ; but at my solicitation and for my special use , some of the young men attached to marheyo ’ s household , under the direction of the indefatigable kory-kory , brought up a light and tastefully carved canoe from the sea . it was launched upon the sheet of water , and floated there as gracefully as a swan . but , melancholy to relate , it produced an effect i had not anticipated . the sweet nymphs , who had sported with me before on the lake , now all fled its vicinity . the prohibited craft , guarded by the edicts of the ‘ taboo , ’ extended the prohibition to the waters in which it lay .
melville	typee	for a few days , kory-kory , with one or two other youths , accompanied me in my excursions to the lake , and while i paddled about in my light canoe , would swim after me shouting and gambolling in pursuit . but i as ever partial to what is termed in the ‘ young men ’ s own book ’ -- ‘ the society of virtuous and intelligent young ladies ; ’ and in the absence of the mermaids , the amusement became dull and insipid . one morning i expressed to my faithful servitor my desire for the return of the nymphs . the honest fellow looked at me bewildered for a moment , and then shook his head solemnly , and murmured ‘ taboo ! taboo ! ’ giving me to understand that unless the canoe was removed i could not expect to have the young ladies back again . but to this procedure i was averse ; i not only wanted the canoe to stay where it was , but i wanted the beauteous fayaway to get into it , and paddle with me about the lake . this latter proposition completely horrified kory-kory ’ s notions of propriety . he inveighed against it , as something too monstrous to be thought of . it not only shocked their established notions of propriety , but was at variance with all their religious ordinances .
melville	typee	however , although the ‘ taboo ’ was a ticklish thing to meddle with , i determined to test its capabilities of resisting an attack . i consulted the chief mehevi , who endeavoured to dissuade me from my object ; but i was not to be repulsed ; and accordingly increased the warmth of my solicitations . at last he entered into a long , and i have no doubt a very learned and eloquent exposition of the history and nature of the ‘ taboo ’ as affecting this particular case ; employing a variety of most extraordinary words , which , from their amazing length and sonorousness , i have every reason to believe were of a theological nature . but all that he said failed to convince me : partly , perhaps , because i could not comprehend a word that he uttered ; but chiefly , that for the life of me i could not understand why a woman would not have as much right to enter a canoe as a man . at last he became a little more rational , and intimated that , out of the abundant love he bore me , he would consult with the priests and see what could be done .
melville	typee	how it was that the priesthood of typee satisfied the affair with their consciences , i know not ; but so it was , and fayaway dispensation from this portion of the taboo was at length procured . such an event i believe never before had occurred in the valley ; but it was high time the islanders should be taught a little gallantry , and i trust that the example i set them may produce beneficial effects . ridiculous , indeed , that the lovely creatures should be obliged to paddle about in the water , like so many ducks , while a parcel of great strapping fellows skimmed over its surface in their canoes .
melville	typee	the first day after fayaway ’ s emancipation , i had a delightful little party on the lake -- the damsels ’ kory-kory , and myself . my zealous body-servant brought from the house a calabash of poee-poee , half a dozen young cocoanuts -- stripped of their husks -- three pipes , as many yams , and me on his back a part of the way . something of a load ; but kory-kory was a very strong man for his size , and by no means brittle in the spine . we had a very pleasant day ; my trusty valet plied the paddle and swept us gently along the margin of the water , beneath the shades of the overhanging thickets . fayaway and i reclined in the stern of the canoe , on the very best terms possible with one another ; the gentle nymph occasionally placing her pipe to her lip , and exhaling the mild fumes of the tobacco , to which her rosy breath added a fresh perfume . strange as it may seem , there is nothing in which a young and beautiful female appears to more advantage than in the act of smoking . how captivating is a peruvian lady , swinging in her gaily-woven hammock of grass , extended between two orange-trees , and inhaling the fragrance of a choice cigarro !
melville	typee	but fayaway , holding in her delicately formed olive hand the long yellow reed of her pipe , with its quaintly carved bowl , and every few moments languishingly giving forth light wreaths of vapour from her mouth and nostrils , looked still more engaging .
melville	typee	we floated about thus for several hours , when i looked up to the warm , glowing , tropical sky , and then down into the transparent depths below ; and when my eye , wandering from the bewitching scenery around , fell upon the grotesquely-tattooed form of kory-kory , and finally , encountered the pensive gaze of fayaway , i thought i had been transported to some fairy region , so unreal did everything appear .
melville	typee	this lovely piece of water was the coolest spot in all the valley , and i now made it a place of continual resort during the hottest period of the day . one side of it lay near the termination of a long gradually expanding gorge , which mounted to the heights that environed the vale . the strong trade wind , met in its course by these elevations , circled and eddied about their summits , and was sometimes driven down the steep ravine and swept across the valley , ruffling in its passage the otherwise tranquil surface of the lake .
melville	typee	one day , after we had been paddling about for some time , i disembarked kory-kory , and paddled the canoe to the windward side of the lake . as i turned the canoe , fayaway , who was with me , seemed all at once to be struck with some happy idea . with a wild exclamation of delight , she disengaged from her person the ample robe of tappa which was knotted over her shoulder ( for the purpose of shielding her from the sun ) , and spreading it out like a sail , stood erect with upraised arms in the head of the canoe . we american sailors pride ourselves upon our straight , clean spars , but a prettier little mast than fayaway made was never shipped aboard of any craft .
melville	typee	in a moment the tappa was distended by the breeze -- the long brown tresses of fayaway streamed in the air -- and the canoe glided rapidly through the water , and shot towards the shore . seated in the stern , i directed its course with my paddle until it dashed up the soft sloping bank , and fayaway , with a light spring alighted on the ground ; whilst kory-kory , who had watched our manoeuvres with admiration , now clapped his hands in transport , and shouted like a madman . many a time afterwards was this feat repeated .
melville	typee	if the reader has not observed ere this that i was the declared admirer of miss fayaway , all i can say is that he is little conversant with affairs of the heart , and i certainly shall not trouble myself to enlighten him any farther . out of the calico i had brought from the ship i made a dress for this lovely girl . in it she looked , i must confess , something like an opera-dancer .
melville	typee	the drapery of the latter damsel generally commences a little above the elbows , but my island beauty ’ s began at the waist , and terminated sufficiently far above the ground to reveal the most bewitching ankle in the universe .
melville	typee	the day that fayaway first wore this robe was rendered memorable by a new acquaintance being introduced to me . in the afternoon i was lying in the house when i heard a great uproar outside ; but being by this time pretty well accustomed to the wild halloos which were almost continually ringing through the valley , i paid little attention to it , until old marheyo , under the influence of some strange excitement , rushed into my presence and communicated the astounding tidings , ‘ marnoo pemi ! ’ which being interpreted , implied that an individual by the name of marnoo was approaching .
melville	typee	my worthy old friend evidently expected that this intelligence would produce a great effect upon me , and for a time he stood earnestly regarding me , as if curious to see how i should conduct myself , but as i remained perfectly unmoved , the old gentleman darted out of the house again , in as great a hurry as he had entered it .
melville	typee	‘ marnoo , marnoo , ’ cogitated i , ‘ i have never heard that name before . some distinguished character , i presume , from the prodigious riot the natives are making ; ’ the tumultuous noise drawing nearer and nearer every moment , while ‘ marnoo ! -- marnoo ! ’ was shouted by every tongue .
melville	typee	i made up my mind that some savage warrior of consequence , who had not yet enjoyed the honour of an audience , was desirous of paying his respects on the present occasion . so vain had i become by the lavish attention to which i had been accustomed , that i felt half inclined , as a punishment for such neglect , to give this marnoo a cold reception , when the excited throng came within view , convoying one of the most striking specimens of humanity that i ever beheld .
melville	typee	the stranger could not have been more than twenty-five years of age , and was a little above the ordinary height ; had he a single hair ’ s breadth taller , the matchless symmetry of his form would have been destroyed . his unclad limbs were beautifully formed ; whilst the elegant outline of his figure , together with his beardless cheeks , might have entitled him to the distinction of standing for the statue of the polynesian apollo ; and indeed the oval of his countenance and the regularity of every feature reminded one of an antique bust . but the marble repose of art was supplied by a warmth and liveliness of expression only to be seen in the south sea islander under the most favourable developments of nature . the hair of marnoo was a rich curling brown , and twined about his temples and neck in little close curling ringlets , which danced up and down continually , when he was animated in conversation . his cheek was of a feminine softness , and his face was free from the least blemish of tattooing , although the rest of his body was drawn all over with fanciful figures , which -- unlike the unconnected sketching usual among these natives -- appeared to have been executed in conformity with some general design .
melville	typee	the tattooing on his back in particular attracted my attention . the artist employed must indeed have excelled in his profession . traced along the course of the spine was accurately delineated the slender , tapering and diamond checkered shaft of the beautiful ‘ artu ’ tree . branching from the stem on each side , and disposed alternately , were the graceful branches drooping with leaves all correctly drawn and elaborately finished . indeed the best specimen of the fine arts i had yet seen in typee . a rear view of the stranger might have suggested the idea of a spreading vine tacked against a garden wall . upon his breast , arms and legs , were exhibited an infinite variety of figures ; every one of which , however , appeared to have reference to the general effect sought to be produced . the tattooing i have described was of the brightest blue , and when contrasted with the light olive-colour of the skin , produced an unique and even elegant effect . a slight girdle of white tappa , scarcely two inches in width , but hanging before and behind in spreading tassels , composed the entire costume of the stranger .
melville	typee	he advanced surrounded by the islanders , carrying under one arm a small roll of native cloth , and grasping in his other hand a long and richly decorated spear . his manner was that of a traveller conscious that he is approaching a comfortable stage in his journey . every moment he turned good-humouredly on the throng around him , and gave some dashing sort of reply to their incessant queries , which appeared to convulse them with uncontrollable mirth .
melville	typee	struck by his demeanour , and the peculiarity of his appearance , so unlike that of the shaven-crowned and face-tattooed natives in general , i involuntarily rose as he entered the house , and proffered him a seat on the mats beside me . but without deigning to notice the civility , or even the more incontrovertible fact of my existence , the stranger passed on , utterly regardless of me , and flung himself upon the further end of the long couch that traversed the sole apartment of marheyo ’ s habitation .
melville	typee	had the belle of the season , in the pride of her beauty and power , been cut in a place of public resort by some supercilious exquisite , she could not have felt greater indignation than i did at this unexpected slight .
melville	typee	i was thrown into utter astonishment . the conduct of the savages had prepared me to anticipate from every newcomer the same extravagant expressions of curiosity and regard . the singularity of his conduct , however , only roused my desire to discover who this remarkable personage might be , who now engrossed the attention of every one .
melville	typee	tinor placed before him a calabash of poee-poee , from which the stranger regaled himself , alternating every mouthful with some rapid exclamation , which was eagerly caught up and echoed by the crowd that completely filled the house . when i observed the striking devotion of the natives to him , and their temporary withdrawal of all attention from myself , i felt not a little piqued . the glory of tommo is departed , thought i , and the sooner he removes from the valley the better . these were my feelings at the moment , and they were prompted by that glorious principle inherent in all heroic natures -- the strong-rooted determination to have the biggest share of the pudding or to go without any of it .
melville	typee	marnoo , that all-attractive personage , having satisfied his hunger and inhaled a few whiffs from a pipe which was handed to him , launched out into an harangue which completely enchained the attention of his auditors .
melville	typee	little as i understood of the language , yet from his animated gestures and the varying expression of his features -- reflected as from so many mirrors in the countenances around him , i could easily discover the nature of those passions which he sought to arouse . from the frequent recurrence of the words ‘ nukuheva ’ and ‘ frannee ’ ( french ) , and some others with the meaning of which i was acquainted , he appeared to be rehearsing to his auditors events which had recently occurred in the neighbouring bays . but how he had gained the knowledge of these matters i could not understand , unless it were that he had just come from nukuheva -- a supposition which his travel-stained appearance not a little supported . but , if a native of that region , i could not account for his friendly reception at the hands of the typees .
melville	typee	never , certainly , had i beheld so powerful an exhibition of natural eloquence as marnoo displayed during the course of his oration . the grace of the attitudes into which he threw his flexible figure , the striking gestures of his naked arms , and above all , the fire which shot from his brilliant eyes , imparted an effect to the continually changing accents of his voice , of which the most accomplished orator might have been proud . at one moment reclining sideways upon the mat , and leaning calmly upon his bended arm , he related circumstantially the aggressions of the french -- their hostile visits to the surrounding bays , enumerating each one in succession -- happar , puerka , nukuheva , tior , -- and then starting to his feet and precipitating himself forward with clenched hands and a countenance distorted with passion , he poured out a tide of invectives . falling back into an attitude of lofty command , he exhorted the typees to resist these encroachments ; reminding them , with a fierce glance of exultation , that as yet the terror of their name had preserved them from attack , and with a scornful sneer he sketched in ironical terms the wondrous intrepidity of the french , who , with five war-canoes and hundreds of men , had not dared to assail the naked warriors of their valley .
melville	typee	the effect he produced upon his audience was electric ; one and all they stood regarding him with sparkling eyes and trembling limbs , as though they were listening to the inspired voice of a prophet .
melville	typee	but it soon appeared that marnoo ’ s powers were as versatile as they were extraordinary . as soon as he had finished his vehement harangue , he threw himself again upon the mats , and , singling out individuals in the crowd , addressed them by name , in a sort of bantering style , the humour of which , though nearly hidden from me filled the whole assembly with uproarious delight .
melville	typee	he had a word for everybody ; and , turning rapidly from one to another , gave utterance to some hasty witticism , which was sure to be followed by peals of laughter . to the females as well as to the men , he addressed his discourse . heaven only knows what he said to them , but he caused smiles and blushes to mantle their ingenuous faces . i am , indeed , very much inclined to believe that marnoo , with his handsome person and captivating manners , was a sad deceiver among the simple maidens of the island .
melville	typee	during all this time he had never , for one moment , deigned to regard me . he appeared , indeed , to be altogether unconscious of my presence . i was utterly at a loss how to account for this extraordinary conduct . i easily perceived that he was a man of no little consequence among the islanders ; that he possessed uncommon talents ; and was gifted with a higher degree of knowledge than the inmates of the valley . for these reasons , i therefore greatly feared lest having , from some cause or other , unfriendly feelings towards me , he might exert his powerful influence to do me mischief .
melville	typee	it seemed evident that he was not a permanent resident of the vale , and yet , whence could he have come ? on all sides the typees were girt in by hostile tribes , and how could he possibly , if belonging to any of these , be received with so much cordiality ?
melville	typee	the personal appearance of the enigmatical stranger suggested additional perplexities . the face , free from tattooing , and the unshaven crown , were peculiarities i had never before remarked in any part of the island , and i had always heard that the contrary were considered the indispensable distinction of a marquesan warrior . altogether the matter was perfectly incomprehensible to me , and i awaited its solution with no small degree of anxiety .
melville	typee	at length , from certain indications , i suspected that he was making me the subject of his remarks , although he appeared cautiously to avoid either pronouncing my name , or looking in the direction where i lay . all at once he rose from the mats where he had been reclining , and , still conversing , moved towards me , his eye purposely evading mine , and seated himself within less than a yard of me . i had hardly recovered from my surprise , when he suddenly turned round , and , with a most benignant countenance extended his right hand gracefully towards me . of course i accepted the courteous challenge , and , as soon as our palms met , he bent towards me , and murmured in musical accents -- ‘ how you do ? ’ ‘ how long you been in this bay ? ’ ‘ you like this bay ? ’
melville	typee	had i been pierced simultaneously by three happar spears , i could not have started more than i did at hearing these simple questions . for a moment i was overwhelmed with astonishment , and then answered something i know not what ; but as soon as i regained my self-possession , the thought darted through my mind that from this individual i might obtain that information regarding toby which i suspected the natives had purposely withheld from me . accordingly i questioned him concerning the disappearance of my companion , but he denied all knowledge of the matter . i then inquired from whence he had come ? he replied , from nukuheva . when i expressed my surprise , he looked at me for a moment , as if enjoying my perplexity , and then with his strange vivacity , exclaimed , -- ‘ ah ! me taboo , -- me go nukuheva , -- me go tior , -- me go typee , -- me go everywhere , -- nobody harm me , -- me taboo . ’
melville	typee	this explanation would have been altogether unintelligible to me , had it not recalled to my mind something i had previously heard concerning a singular custom among these islanders . though the country is possessed by various tribes , whose mutual hostilities almost wholly prelude any intercourse between them ; yet there are instances where a person having ratified friendly relations with some individual belonging longing to the valley , whose inmates are at war with his own , may , under particular restrictions , venture with impunity into the country of his friend , where , under other circumstances , he would have been treated as an enemy . in this light are personal friendships regarded among them , and the individual so protected is said to be ‘ taboo ’ , and his person , to a certain extent , is held as sacred . thus the stranger informed me he had access to all the valleys in the island .
melville	typee	curious to know how he had acquired his knowledge of english , i questioned him on the subject . at first , for some reason or other , he evaded the inquiry , but afterwards told me that , when a boy , he had been carried to sea by the captain of a trading vessel , with whom he had stayed three years , living part of the time with him at sidney in australia , and that at a subsequent visit to the island , the captain had , at his own request , permitted him to remain among his countrymen . the natural quickness of the savage had been wonderfully improved by his intercourse with the white men , and his partial knowledge of a foreign language gave him a great ascendancy over his less accomplished countrymen .
melville	typee	when i asked the now affable marnoo why it was that he had not previously spoken to me , he eagerly inquired what i had been led to think of him from his conduct in that respect . i replied , that i had supposed him to be some great chief or warrior , who had seen plenty of white men before , and did not think it worth while to notice a poor sailor . at this declaration of the exalted opinion i had formed of him , he appeared vastly gratified , and gave me to understand that he had purposely behaved in that manner , in order to increase my astonishment , as soon as he should see proper to address me .
melville	typee	marnoo now sought to learn my version of the story as to how i came to be an inmate of the typee valley . when i related to him the circumstances under which toby and i had entered it , he listened with evident interest ; but as soon as i alluded to the absence , yet unaccounted for , of my comrade , he endeavoured to change the subject , as if it were something he desired not to agitate . it seemed , indeed , as if everything connected with toby was destined to beget distrust and anxiety in my bosom . notwithstanding marnoo ’ s denial of any knowledge of his fate , i could not avoid suspecting that he was deceiving me ; and this suspicion revived those frightful apprehensions with regard to my own fate , which , for a short time past , had subsided in my breast .
melville	typee	influenced by these feelings , i now felt a strong desire to avail myself of the stranger ’ s protection , and under his safeguard to return to nukuheva . but as soon as i hinted at this , he unhesitatingly pronounced it to be entirely impracticable ; assuring me that the typees would never consent to my leaving the valley . although what he said merely confirmed the impression which i had before entertained , still it increased my anxiety to escape from a captivity which , however endurable , nay , delightful it might be in some respects , involved in its issues a fate marked by the most frightful contingencies .
melville	typee	i could not conceal from my mind that toby had been treated in the same friendly manner as i had been , and yet all their kindness terminated with his mysterious disappearance . might not the same fate await me ? -- a fate too dreadful to think of . stimulated by these considerations , i urged anew my request to marnoo ; but he only set forth in stronger colours the impossibility of my escape , and repeated his previous declaration that the typees would never be brought to consent to my departure .
melville	typee	when i endeavoured to learn from him the motives which prompted them to hold me a prisoner , marnoo again presumed that mysterious tone which had tormented me with apprehension when i had questioned him with regard to the fate of my companion .
melville	typee	thus repulsed , in a manner which only served , by arousing the most dreadful forebodings , to excite me to renewed attempts , i conjured him to intercede for me with the natives , and endeavour to procure their consent to my leaving them . to this he appeared strongly averse ; but , yielding at last to my importunities , he addressed several of the chiefs , who with the rest had been eyeing us intently during the whole of our conversation . his petition , however , was at once met with the most violent disapprobation , manifesting itself in angry glances and gestures , and a perfect torrent of passionate words , directed to both him and myself . marnoo , evidently repenting the step he had taken , earnestly deprecated the resentment of the crowd , and , in a few moments succeeded in pacifying to some extent the clamours which had broken out as soon as his proposition had been understood .
melville	typee	with the most intense interest had i watched the reception his intercession might receive ; and a bitter pang shot through my heart at the additional evidence , now furnished , of the unchangeable determination of the islanders . marnoo told me with evident alarm in his countenance , that although admitted into the bay on a friendly footing with its inhabitants , he could not presume to meddle with their concerns , as such procedure , if persisted in , would at once absolve the typees from the restraints of the ‘ taboo ’ , although so long as he refrained from such conduct , it screened him effectually from the consequences of the enmity they bore his tribe . at this moment , mehevi , who was present , angrily interrupted him ; and the words which he uttered in a commanding tone , evidently meant that he must at once cease talking to me and withdraw to the other part of the house . marnoo immediately started up , hurriedly enjoining me not to address him again , and as i valued my safety , to refrain from all further allusion to the subject of my departure ; and then , in compliance with the order of the determined chief , but not before it had again been angrily repeated , he withdrew to a distance .
melville	typee	i now perceived , with no small degree of apprehension , the same savage expression in the countenances of the natives , which had startled me during the scene at the ti . they glanced their eyes suspiciously from marnoo to me , as if distrusting the nature of an intercourse carried on , as it was , in a language they could not understand , and they seemed to harbour the belief that already we had concerted measures calculated to elude their vigilance .
melville	typee	the lively countenances of these people are wonderfully indicative of the emotions of the soul , and the imperfections of their oral language are more than compensated for by the nervous eloquence of their looks and gestures . i could plainly trace , in every varying expression of their faces , all those passions which had been thus unexpectedly aroused in their bosoms .
melville	typee	it required no reflection to convince me , from what was going on , that the injunction of marnoo was not to be rashly slighted ; and accordingly , great as was the effort to suppress my feelings , i accosted mehevi in a good-humoured tone , with a view of dissipating any ill impression he might have received . but the ireful , angry chief was not so easily mollified . he rejected my advances with that peculiarly stern expression i have before described , and took care by the whole of his behaviour towards me to show the displeasure and resentment which he felt .
melville	typee	marnoo , at the other extremity of the house , apparently desirous of making a diversion in my favour , exerted himself to amuse with his pleasantries the crowd about him ; but his lively attempts were not so successful as they had previously been , and , foiled in his efforts , he rose gravely to depart . no one expressed any regret at this movement , so seizing his roll of tappa , and grasping his spear , he advanced to the front of the pi-pi , and waving his hand in adieu to the now silent throng , cast upon me a glance of mingled pity and reproach , and flung himself into the path which led from the house . i watched his receding figure until it was lost in the obscurity of the grove , and then gave myself up to the most desponding reflections .
melville	typee	chapter nineteen reflections after marnoo ’ s departure-battle of the pop-guns -- strange conceit of marheyo -- process of making tappa the knowledge i had now obtained as to the intention of the savages deeply affected me .
melville	typee	marnoo , i perceived , was a man who , by reason of his superior acquirements , and the knowledge he possessed of the events which were taking place in the different bays of the island , was held in no little estimation by the inhabitants of the valley . he had been received with the most cordial welcome and respect . the natives had hung upon the accents of his voice , and , had manifested the highest gratification at being individually noticed by him . and yet despite all this , a few words urged in my behalf , with the intent of obtaining my release from captivity , had sufficed not only to banish all harmony and good-will ; but , if i could believe what he told me , had gone on to endanger his own personal safety .
melville	typee	how strongly rooted , then , must be the determination of the typees with regard to me , and how suddenly could they display the strangest passions ! the mere suggestion of my departure had estranged from me , for the time at least , mehevi , who was the most influential of all the chiefs , and who had previously exhibited so many instances of his friendly sentiments . the rest of the natives had likewise evinced their strong repugnance to my wishes , and even kory-kory himself seemed to share in the general disapprobation bestowed upon me .
melville	typee	in vain i racked my invention to find out some motive for them , but i could discover none . but however this might be , the scene which had just occurred admonished me of the danger of trifling with the wayward and passionate spirits against whom it was vain to struggle , and might even be fatal to do go . my only hope was to induce the natives to believe that i was reconciled to my detention in the valley , and by assuming a tranquil and cheerful demeanour , to allay the suspicions which i had so unfortunately aroused . their confidence revived , they might in a short time remit in some degree their watchfulness over my movements , and i should then be the better enabled to avail myself of any opportunity which presented itself for escape . i determined , therefore , to make the best of a bad bargain , and to bear up manfully against whatever might betide . in this endeavour , i succeeded beyond my own expectations . at the period of marnoo ’ s visit , i had been in the valley , as nearly as i could conjecture , some two months . although not completely recovered from my strange illness , which still lingered about me , i was free from pain and able to take exercise . in short , i had every reason to anticipate a perfect recovery . freed from apprehension on this point , and resolved to regard the future without flinching , i flung myself anew into all the social pleasures of the valley , and sought to bury all regrets , and all remembrances of my previous existence in the wild enjoyments it afforded .
melville	typee	in my various wanderings through the vale , and as i became better acquainted with the character of its inhabitants , i was more and more struck with the light-hearted joyousness that everywhere prevailed . the minds of these simple savages , unoccupied by matters of graver moment , were capable of deriving the utmost delight from circumstances which would have passed unnoticed in more intelligent communities . all their enjoyment , indeed , seemed to be made up of the little trifling incidents of the passing hour ; but these diminutive items swelled altogether to an amount of happiness seldom experienced by more enlightened individuals , whose pleasures are drawn from more elevated but rarer sources .
melville	typee	what community , for instance , of refined and intellectual mortals would derive the least satisfaction from shooting pop-guns ? the mere supposition of such a thing being possible would excite their indignation , and yet the whole population of typee did little else for ten days but occupy themselves with that childish amusement , fairly screaming , too , with the delight it afforded them .
melville	typee	one day i was frolicking with a little spirited urchin , some six years old , who chased me with a piece of bamboo about three feet long , with which he occasionally belaboured me . seizing the stick from him , the idea happened to suggest itself , that i might make for the youngster , out of the slender tube , one of those nursery muskets with which i had sometimes seen children playing .
melville	typee	accordingly , with my knife i made two parallel slits in the cane several inches in length , and cutting loose at one end the elastic strip between them , bent it back and slipped the point into a little notch made for the purse . any small substance placed against this would be projected with considerable force through the tube , by merely springing the bent strip out of the notch .
melville	typee	had i possessed the remotest idea of the sensation this piece of ordnance was destined to produce , i should certainly have taken out a patent for the invention . the boy scampered away with it , half delirious with ecstasy , and in twenty minutes afterwards i might have been seen surrounded by a noisy crowd -- venerable old graybeards -- responsible fathers of families -- valiant warriors -- matrons -- young men -- girls and children , all holding in their hands bits of bamboo , and each clamouring to be served first .
melville	typee	for three or four hours i was engaged in manufacturing pop-guns , but at last made over my good-will and interest in the concern to a lad of remarkably quick parts , whom i soon initiated into the art and mystery .
melville	typee	pop , pop , pop , pop , now resounded all over the valley . duels , skirmishes , pitched battles , and general engagements were to be seen on every side . here , as you walked along a path which led through a thicket , you fell into a cunningly laid ambush , and became a target for a body of musketeers whose tattooed limbs you could just see peeping into view through the foliage . there you were assailed by the intrepid garrison of a house , who levelled their bamboo rifles at you from between the upright canes which composed its sides . farther on you were fired upon by a detachment of sharpshooters , mounted upon the top of a pi-pi .
melville	typee	pop , pop , pop , pop ! green guavas , seeds , and berries were flying about in every direction , and during this dangerous state of affairs i was half afraid that , like the man and his brazen bull , i should fall a victim to my own ingenuity . like everything else , however , the excitement gradually wore away , though ever after occasionally pop-guns might be heard at all hours of the day .
melville	typee	it was towards the close of the pop-gun war , that i was infinitely diverted with a strange freak of marheyo ’ s . i had worn , when i quitted the ship , a pair of thick pumps , which , from the rough usage they had received in scaling precipices and sliding down gorges , were so dilapidated as to be altogether unfit for use -- so , at least , would have thought the generality of people , and so they most certainly were , when considered in the light of shoes . but things unservicable in one way , may with advantage be applied in another , that is , if one have genius enough for the purpose . this genius marheyo possessed in a superlative degree , as he abundantly evinced by the use to which he put those sorely bruised and battered old shoes .
melville	typee	every article , however trivial , which belonged to me , the natives appeared to regard as sacred ; and i observed that for several days after becoming an inmate of the house , my pumps were suffered to remain , untouched , where i had first happened to throw them . i remembered , however , that after awhile i had missed them from their accustomed place ; but the matter gave me no concern , supposing that tinor -- like any other tidy housewife , having come across them in some of her domestic occupations -- had pitched the useless things out of the house . but i was soon undeceived .
melville	typee	one day i observed old marheyo bustling about me with unusual activity , and to such a degree as almost to supersede kory-kory in the functions of his office . one moment he volunteered to trot off with me on his back to the stream ; and when i refused , noways daunted by the repulse , he continued to frisk about me like a superannuated house-dog . i could not for the life of me conjecture what possessed the old gentleman , until all at once , availing himself of the temporary absence of the household , he went through a variety of of uncouth gestures , pointing eagerly down to my feet , then up to a little bundle , which swung from the ridge pole overhead . at last i caught a faint idea of his meaning , and motioned him to lower the package . he executed the order in the twinkling of an eye , and unrolling a piece of tappa , displayed to my astonished gaze the identical pumps which i thought had been destroyed long before .
melville	typee	i immediately comprehended his desire , and very generously gave him the shoes , which had become quite mouldy , wondering for what earthly purpose he could want them . the same afternoon i descried the venerable warrior approaching the house , with a slow , stately gait , ear-rings in ears , and spear in hand , with this highly ornamental pair of shoes suspended from his neck by a strip of bark , and swinging backwards and forwards on his capacious chest . in the gala costume of the tasteful marheyo , these calf-skin pendants ever after formed the most striking feature .
melville	typee	but to turn to something a little more important . although the whole existence of the inhabitants of the valley seemed to pass away exempt from toil , yet there were some light employments which , although amusing rather than laborious as occupations , contributed to their comfort and luxury . among these the most important was the manufacture of the native cloth , -- ‘ tappa ’ , -- so well known , under various modifications , throughout the whole polynesian archipelago . as is generally understood , this useful and sometimes elegant article is fabricated from the bark of different trees . but , as i believe that no description of its manufacture has ever been given , i shall state what i know regarding it .
melville	typee	in the manufacture of the beautiful white tappa generally worn on the marquesan islands , the preliminary operation consists in gathering a certain quantity of the young branches of the cloth-tree . the exterior green bark being pulled off as worthless , there remains a slender fibrous substance , which is carefully stripped from the stick , to which it closely adheres . when a sufficient quantity of it has been collected , the various strips are enveloped in a covering of large leaves , which the natives use precisely as we do wrapping-paper , and which are secured by a few turns of a line passed round them . the package is then laid in the bed of some running stream , with a heavy stone placed over it , to prevent its being swept away . after it has remained for two or three days in this state , it is drawn out , and exposed , for a short time , to the action of the air , every distinct piece being attentively inspected , with a view of ascertaining whether it has yet been sufficiently affected by the operation . this is repeated again and again , until the desired result is obtained .
melville	typee	when the substance is in a proper state for the next process , it betrays evidences of incipient decomposition ; the fibres are relaxed and softened , and rendered perfectly malleable . the different strips are now extended , one by one , in successive layers , upon some smooth surface -- generally the prostrate trunk of a cocoanut tree -- and the heap thus formed is subjected , at every new increase , to a moderate beating , with a sort of wooden mallet , leisurely applied . the mallet is made of a hard heavy wood resembling ebony , is about twelve inches in length , and perhaps two in breadth , with a rounded handle at one end , and in shape is the exact counterpart of one of our four-sided razor-strops . the flat surfaces of the implement are marked with shallow parallel indentations , varying in depth on the different sides , so as to be adapted to the several stages of the operation . these marks produce the corduroy sort of stripes discernible in the tappa in its finished state . after being beaten in the manner i have described , the material soon becomes blended in one mass , which , moistened occasionally with water , is at intervals hammered out , by a kind of gold-beating process , to any degree of thinness required . in this way the cloth is easily made to vary in strength and thickness , so as to suit the numerous purposes to which it is applied .
melville	typee	when the operation last described has been concluded , the new-made tappa is spread out on the grass to bleach and dry , and soon becomes of a dazzling whiteness . sometimes , in the first stages of the manufacture , the substance is impregnated with a vegetable juice , which gives it a permanent colour . a rich brown and a bright yellow are occasionally seen , but the simple taste of the typee people inclines them to prefer the natural tint .
melville	typee	the notable wife of kamehameha , the renowned conqueror and king of the sandwich islands , used to pride herself in the skill she displayed in dyeing her tappa with contrasting colours disposed in regular figures ; and , in the midst of the innovations of the times , was regarded , towards the decline of her life , as a lady of the old school , clinging as she did to the national cloth , in preference to the frippery of the european calicoes . but the art of printing the tappa is unknown upon the marquesan islands . in passing along the valley , i was often attracted by the noise of the mallet , which , when employed in the manufacture of the cloth produces at every stroke of its hard , heavy wood , a clear , ringing , and musical sound , capable of being heard at a great distance . when several of these implements happen to be in operation at the same time , near one another , the effect upon the ear of a person , at a little distance , is really charming .
melville	typee	chapter twenty history of a day as usually spent in typee valley -- dances of the marquesan girls nothing can be more uniform and undiversified than the life of the typees ; one tranquil day of ease and happiness follows another in quiet succession ; and with these unsophisicated savages the history of a day is the history of a life . i will , therefore , as briefly as i can , describe one of our days in the valley .
melville	typee	to begin with the morning . we were not very early risers -- the sun would be shooting his golden spikes above the happar mountain , ere i threw aside my tappa robe , and girding my long tunic about my waist , sallied out with fayaway and kory-kory , and the rest of the household , and bent my steps towards the stream . here we found congregated all those who dwelt in our section of the valley ; and here we bathed with them . the fresh morning air and the cool flowing waters put both soul and body in a glow , and after a half-hour employed in this recreation , we sauntered back to the house -- tinor and marheyo gathering dry sticks by the way for fire-wood ; some of the young men laying the cocoanut trees under contribution as they passed beneath them ; while kory-kory played his outlandish pranks for my particular diversion , and fayaway and i , not arm in arm to be sure , but sometimes hand in hand , strolled along , with feelings of perfect charity for all the world , and especial good-will towards each other .
melville	typee	our morning meal was soon prepared . the islanders are somewhat abstemious at this repast ; reserving the more powerful efforts of their appetite to a later period of the day . for my own part , with the assistance of my valet , who , as i have before stated , always officiated as spoon on these occasions , i ate sparingly from one of tinor ’ s trenchers , of poee-poee ; which was devoted exclusively for my own use , being mixed with the milky meat of ripe cocoanut . a section of a roasted bread-fruit , a small cake of ‘ amar ’ , or a mess of ‘ cokoo , ’ two or three bananas , or a mammee-apple ; an annuee , or some other agreeable and nutritious fruit served from day to day to diversify the meal , which was finished by tossing off the liquid contents of a young cocoanut or two .
melville	typee	while partaking of this simple repast , the inmates of marheyo ’ s house , after the style of the ancient romans , reclined in sociable groups upon the divan of mats , and digestion was promoted by cheerful conversation .
melville	typee	after the morning meal was concluded , pipes were lighted ; and among them my own especial pipe , a present from the noble mehevi . the islanders , who only smoke a whiff or two at a time , and at long intervals , and who keep their pipes going from hand to hand continually , regarded my systematic smoking of four or five pipefuls of tobacco in succession , as something quite wonderful . when two or three pipes had circulated freely , the company gradually broke up . marheyo went to the little hut he was forever building . tinor began to inspect her rolls of tappa , or employed her busy fingers in plaiting grass-mats . the girls anointed themselves with their fragrant oils , dressed their hair , or looked over their curious finery , and compared together their ivory trinkets , fashioned out of boar ’ s tusks or whale ’ s teeth . the young men and warriors produced their spears , paddles , canoe-gear , battle-clubs , and war-conchs , and occupied themselves in carving , all sorts of figures upon them with pointed bits of shell or flint , and adorning them , especially the war-conchs , with tassels of braided bark and tufts of human hair . some , immediately after eating , threw themselves once more upon the inviting mats , and resumed the employment of the previous night , sleeping as soundly as if they had not closed their eyes for a week . others sallied out into the groves , for the purpose of gathering fruit or fibres of bark and leaves ; the last two being in constant requisition , and applied to a hundred uses . a few , perhaps , among the girls , would slip into the woods after flowers , or repair to the stream will ; small calabashes and cocoanut shells , in order to polish them by friction with a smooth stone in the water . in truth these innocent people seemed to be at no loss for something to occupy their time ; and it would be no light task to enumerate all their employments , or rather pleasures .
melville	typee	my own mornings i spent in a variety of ways . sometimes i rambled about from house to house , sure of receiving a cordial welcome wherever i went ; or from grove to grove , and from one shady place to another , in company with kory-kory and fayaway , and a rabble rout of merry young idlers . sometimes i was too indolent for exercise , and accepting one of the many invitations i was continually receiving , stretched myself out on the mats of some hospitable dwelling , and occupied myself pleasantly either in watching the proceedings of those around me or taking part in them myself . whenever i chose to do the latter , the delight of the islanders was boundless ; and there was always a throng of competitors for the honour of instructing me in any particular craft . i soon became quite an accomplished hand at making tappa -- could braid a grass sling as well as the best of them -- and once , with my knife , carved the handle of a javelin so exquisitely , that i have no doubt , to this day , karnoonoo , its owner , preserves it as a surprising specimen of my skill . as noon approached , all those who had wandered forth from our habitation , began to return ; and when midday was fairly come scarcely a sound was to be heard in the valley : a deep sleep fell upon all . the luxurious siesta was hardly ever omitted , except by old marheyo , who was so eccentric a character , that he seemed to be governed by no fixed principles whatever ; but acting just according to the humour of the moment , slept , ate , or tinkered away at his little hut , without regard to the proprieties of time or place . frequently he might have been seen taking a nap in the sun at noon-day , or a bath in the stream of mid-night . once i beheld him perched eighty feet from the ground , in the tuft of a cocoanut tree , smoking ; and often i saw him standing up to the waist in water , engaged in plucking out the stray hairs of his beard , using a piece of muscle-shell for tweezers .
melville	typee	the noon-tide slumber lasted generally an hour and a half : very often longer ; and after the sleepers had arisen from their mats they again had recourse to their pipes , and then made preparations for the most important meal of the day .
melville	typee	i , however , like those gentlemen of leisure who breakfast at home and dine at their club , almost invariably , during my intervals of health , enjoyed the afternoon repast with the bachelor chiefs of the ti , who were always rejoiced to see me , and lavishly spread before me all the good things which their larder afforded . mehevi generally introduced among other dainties a baked pig , an article which i have every reason to suppose was provided for my sole gratification .
melville	typee	the ti was a right jovial place . it did my heart , as well as my body , good to visit it . secure from female intrusion , there was no restraint upon the hilarity of the warriors , who , like the gentlemen of europe after the cloth is drawn and the ladies retire , freely indulged their mirth .
melville	typee	after spending a considerable portion of the afternoon at the ti , i usually found myself , as the cool of the evening came on , either sailing on the little lake with fayaway , or bathing in the waters of the stream with a number of the savages , who , at this hour , always repaired thither . as the shadows of night approached marheyo ’ s household were once more assembled under his roof : tapers were lit , long curious chants were raised , interminable stories were told ( for which one present was little the wiser ) , and all sorts of social festivities served to while away the time .
melville	typee	the young girls very often danced by moonlight in front of their dwellings . there are a great variety of these dances , in which , however , i never saw the men take part . they all consist of active , romping , mischievous evolutions , in which every limb is brought into requisition . indeed , the marquesan girls dance all over , as it were ; not only do their feet dance , but their arms , hands , fingers , ay , their very eyes , seem to dance in their heads .
melville	typee	the damsels wear nothing but flowers and their compendious gala tunics ; and when they plume themselves for the dance , they look like a band of olive-coloured sylphides on the point of taking wing . in good sooth , they so sway their floating forms , arch their necks , toss aloft their naked arms , and glide , and swim , and whirl , that it was almost too much for a quiet , sober-minded , modest young man like myself .
melville	typee	unless some particular festivity was going forward , the inmates of marheyo ’ s house retired to their mats rather early in the evening ; but not for the night , since , after slumbering lightly for a while , they rose again , relit their tapers , partook of the third and last meal of the day , at which poee-poee alone was eaten , and then , after inhaling a narcotic whiff from a pipe of tobacco , disposed themselves for the great business of night , sleep . with the marquesans it might almost most be styled the great business of life , for they pass a large portion of their time in the arms of somnus . the native strength of their constitution is no way shown more emphatically than in the quantity of sleep they can endure . to many of them , indeed , life is little else than an often interrupted and luxurious nap .
melville	typee	chapter twenty-one the spring of arva wai -- remarkable monumental remains -- some ideas with regard to the history of the pi-pis found in the valley almost every country has its medicinal springs famed for their healing virtues . the cheltenham of typee is embosomed in the deepest solitude , and but seldom receives a visitor . it is situated remote from any dwelling , a little way up the mountain , near the head of the valley ; and you approach it by a pathway shaded by the most beautiful foliage , and adorned with a thousand fragrant plants .
melville	typee	the mineral waters of arva wai * ooze forth from the crevices of a rock , and gliding down its mossy side , fall at last , in many clustering drops , into a natural basin of stone fringed round with grass and dewy-looking little violet-coloured flowers , as fresh and beautiful as the perpetual moisture they enjoy can make them .
melville	typee	* i presume this might be translated into ‘ strong waters ’ . arva is the name bestowed upon a root the properties of which are both inebriating and medicinal . ‘ wai ’ is the marquesan word for water .
melville	typee	the water is held in high estimation by the islanders , some of whom consider it an agreeable as well as a medicinal beverage ; they bring it from the mountain in their calabashes , and store it away beneath heaps of leaves in some shady nook near the house . old marheyo had a great love for the waters of the spring . every now and then he lugged off to the mountain a great round demijohn of a calabash , and , panting with his exertions , brought it back filled with his darling fluid .
melville	typee	the water tasted like a solution of a dozen disagreeable things , and was sufficiently nauseous to have made the fortune of the proprietor , had the spa been situated in the midst of any civilized community .
melville	typee	as i am no chemist , i can not give a scientific analysis of the water . all i know about the matter is , that one day marheyo in my presence poured out the last drop from his huge calabash , and i observed at the bottom of the vessel a small quantity of gravelly sediment very much resembling our common sand . whether this is always found in the water , and gives it its peculiar flavour and virtues , or whether its presence was merely incidental , i was not able to ascertain .
melville	typee	one day in returning from this spring by a circuitous path , i came upon a scene which reminded me of stonehenge and the architectural labours of the druids . at the base of one of the mountains , and surrounded on all sides by dense groves , a series of vast terraces of stone rises , step by step , for a considerable distance up the hill side . these terraces can not be less than one hundred yards in length and twenty in width . their magnitude , however , is less striking than the immense size of the blocks composing them . some of the stones , of an oblong shape , are from ten to fifteen feet in length , and five or six feet thick . their sides are quite smooth , but though square , and of pretty regular formation , they bear no mark of the chisel . they are laid together without cement , and here and there show gaps between . the topmost terrace and the lower one are somewhat peculiar in their construction . they have both a quadrangular depression in the centre , leaving the rest of the terrace elevated several feet above it . in the intervals of the stones immense trees have taken root , and their broad boughs stretching far over , and interlacing together , support a canopy almost impenetrable to the sun . overgrowing the greater part of them , and climbing from one to another , is a wilderness of vines , in whose sinewy embrace many of the stones lie half-hidden , while in some places a thick growth of bushes entirely covers them . there is a wild pathway which obliquely crosses two of these terraces ; and so profound is the shade , so dense the vegetation , that a stranger to the place might pass along it without being aware of their existence .
melville	typee	these structures bear every indication of a very high antiquity and kory-kory , who was my authority in all matters of scientific research , gave me to understand that they were coeval with the creation of the world ; that the great gods themselves were the builders ; and that they would endure until time shall be no more .
melville	typee	kory-kory ’ s prompt explanation and his attributing the work to a divine origin , at once convinced me that neither he nor the rest of his country-men knew anything about them . as i gazed upon this monument , doubtless the work of an extinct and forgotten race , thus buried in the green nook of an island at the ends of the earth , the existence of which was yesterday unknown , a stronger feeling of awe came over me than if i had stood musing at the mighty base of the pyramid of cheops . there are no inscriptions , no sculpture , no clue , by which to conjecture its history ; nothing but the dumb stones . how many generations of the majestic trees which overshadow them have grown and flourished and decayed since first they were erected !
melville	typee	these remains naturally suggest many interesting reflections . they establish the great age of the island , an opinion which the builders of theories concerning , the creation of the various groups in the south seas are not always inclined to admit . for my own part , i think it just as probable that human beings were living in the valleys of the marquesas three thousand years ago as that they were inhabiting the land of egypt . the origin of the island of nukuheva can not be imputed to the coral insect ; for indefatigable as that wonderful creature is , it would be hardly muscular enough to pile rocks one upon the other more than three thousand feet above the level of the sea . that the land may have been thrown up by a submarine volcano is as possible as anything else . no one can make an affidavit to the contrary , and therefore i still say nothing against the supposition : indeed , were geologists to assert that the whole continent of america had in like manner been formed by the simultaneous explosion of a train of etnas laid under the water all the way from the north pole to the parallel of cape horn , i am the last man in the world to contradict them .
melville	typee	i have already mentioned that the dwellings of the islanders were almost invariably built upon massive stone foundations , which they call pi-pis . the dimensions of these , however , as well as of the stones composing them , are comparatively small : but there are other and larger erections of a similar description comprising the ‘ morais ’ , or burying grounds , and festival-places , in nearly all the valleys of the island . some of these piles are so extensive , and so great a degree of labour and skill must have been requisite in constructing them , that i can scarcely believe they were built by the ancestors of the present inhabitants . if indeed they were , the race has sadly deteriorated in their knowledge of the mechanic arts . to say nothing of their habitual indolence , by what contrivance within the reach of so simple a people could such enormous masses have been moved or fixed in their places ? and how could they with their rude implements have chiselled and hammered them into shape ?
melville	typee	all of these larger pi-pis -- like that of the hoolah hoolah ground in the typee valley -- bore incontestible marks of great age ; and i am disposed to believe that their erection may be ascribed to the same race of men who were the builders of the still more ancient remains i have just described .
melville	typee	according to kory-kory ’ s account , the pi-pi upon which stands the hoolah hoolah ground was built a great many moons ago , under the direction of monoo , a great chief and warrior , and , as it would appear , master-mason among the typees . it was erected for the express purpose to which it is at present devoted , in the incredibly short period of one sun ; and was dedicated to the immortal wooden idols by a grand festival , which lasted ten days and nights .
melville	typee	among the smaller pi-pis , upon which stand the dwelling-houses of the natives , i never observed any which intimated a recent erection . there are in every part of the valley a great many of these massive stone foundations which have no houses upon them . this is vastly convenient , for whenever an enterprising islander chooses to emigrate a few hundred yards from the place where he was born , all he has to do in order to establish himself in some new locality , is to select one of the many unappropriated pi-pis , and without further ceremony pitch his bamboo tent upon it .
melville	typee	chapter twenty-two preparations for a grand festival in the valley -- strange doings in the taboo groves -- monument of calabashes -- gala costume of the typee damsels -- departure for the festival from the time that my lameness had decreased i had made a daily practice of visiting mehevi at the ti , who invariably gave me a most cordial reception . i was always accompanied in these excursions by fayaway and the ever-present kory-kory . the former , as soon as we reached the vicinity of the ti -- which was rigorously tabooed to the whole female sex -- withdrew to a neighbouring hut , as if her feminine delicacy ‘ restricted ’ her from approaching a habitation which might be regarded as a sort of bachelor ’ s hall .
melville	typee	and in good truth it might well have been so considered . although it was the permanent residence of several distinguished chiefs , and of the noble mehevi in particular , it was still at certain seasons the favourite haunt of all the jolly , talkative , and elderly savages of the vale , who resorted thither in the same way that similar characters frequent a tavern in civilized countries . there they would remain hour after hour , chatting , smoking , eating poee-poee , or busily engaged in sleeping for the good of their constitutions .
melville	typee	this building appeared to be the head-quarters of the valley , where all flying rumours concentrated ; and to have seen it filled with a crowd of the natives , all males , conversing in animated clusters , while multitudes were continually coming and going , one would have thought it a kind of savage exchange , where the rise and fall of polynesian stock was discussed .
melville	typee	mehevi acted as supreme lord over the place , spending the greater portion of his time there : and often when , at particular hours of the day , it was deserted by nearly every one else except the verd-antique looking centenarians , who were fixtures in the building , the chief himself was sure to be found enjoying his ‘ otium cum dignitate ’ -- upon the luxurious mats which covered the floor . whenever i made my appearance he invariably rose , and like a gentleman doing the honours of his mansion , invited me to repose myself wherever i pleased , and calling out ‘ tamaree ! ’ ( boy ) , a little fellow would appear , and then retiring for an instant , return with some savoury mess , from which the chief would press me to regale myself . to tell the truth , mehevi was indebted to the excellence of his viands for the honour of my repeated visits -- a matter which can not appear singular , when it is borne in mind that bachelors , all the world over , are famous for serving up unexceptionable repasts .
melville	typee	one day , on drawing near to the ti , i observed that extensive preparations were going forward , plainly betokening some approaching festival . some of the symptoms reminded me of the stir produced among the scullions of a large hotel , where a grand jubilee dinner is about to be given . the natives were hurrying about hither and thither , engaged in various duties , some lugging off to the stream enormous hollow bamboos , for the purpose of filling them with water ; others chasing furious-looking hogs through the bushes , in their endeavours to capture them ; and numbers employed in kneading great mountains of poee-poee heaped up in huge wooden vessels .
melville	typee	after observing these lively indications for a while , i was attracted to a neighbouring grove by a prodigious squeaking which i heard there . on reaching the spot i found it proceeded from a large hog which a number of natives were forcibly holding to the earth , while a muscular fellow , armed with a bludgeon , was ineffectually aiming murderous blows at the skull of the unfortunate porker . again and again he missed his writhing and struggling victim , but though puffing and panting with his exertions , he still continued them ; and after striking a sufficient number of blows to have demolished an entire drove of oxen , with one crashing stroke he laid him dead at his feet .
melville	typee	without letting any blood from the body , it was immediately carried to a fire which had been kindled near at hand and four savages taking hold of the carcass by its legs , passed it rapidly to and fro in the flames . in a moment the smell of burning bristles betrayed the object of this procedure . having got thus far in the matter , the body was removed to a little distance and , being disembowelled , the entrails were laid aside as choice parts , and the whole carcass thoroughly washed with water . an ample thick green cloth , composed of the long thick leaves of a species of palm-tree , ingeniously tacked together with little pins of bamboo , was now spread upon the ground , in which the body being carefully rolled , it was borne to an oven previously prepared to receive it . here it was at once laid upon the heated stones at the bottom , and covered with thick layers of leaves , the whole being quickly hidden from sight by a mound of earth raised over it .
melville	typee	such is the summary style in which the typees convert perverse-minded and rebellious hogs into the most docile and amiable pork ; a morsel of which placed on the tongue melts like a soft smile from the lips of beauty .
melville	typee	i commend their peculiar mode of proceeding to the consideration of all butchers , cooks , and housewives . the hapless porker whose fate i have just rehearsed , was not the only one who suffered in that memorable day . many a dismal grunt , many an imploring squeak , proclaimed what was going on throughout the whole extent of the valley ; and i verily believe the first-born of every litter perished before the setting of that fatal sun .
melville	typee	the scene around the ti was now most animated . hogs and poee-poee were baking in numerous ovens , which , heaped up with fresh earth into slight elevations , looked like so many ant-hills . scores of the savages were vigorously plying their stone pestles in preparing masses of poee-poee , and numbers were gathering green bread-fruit and young cocoanuts in the surrounding groves ; when an exceeding great multitude , with a view of encouraging the rest in their labours , stood still , and kept shouting most lustily without intermission .
melville	typee	it is a peculiarity among these people , that , when engaged in an employment , they always make a prodigious fuss about it . so seldom do they ever exert themselves , that when they do work they seem determined that so meritorious an action shall not escape the observation of those around if , for example , they have occasion to remove a stone to a little distance , which perhaps might be carried by two able-bodied men , a whole swarm gather about it , and , after a vast deal of palavering , lift it up among them , every one struggling to get hold of it , and bear it off yelling and panting as if accomplishing some mighty achievement . seeing them on these occasions , one is reminded of an infinity of black ants clustering about and dragging away to some hole the leg of a deceased fly .
melville	typee	having for some time attentively observed these demonstrations of good cheer , i entered the ti , where mehevi sat complacently looking out upon the busy scene , and occasionally issuing his orders . the chief appeared to be in an extraordinary flow of spirits and gave me to understand that on the morrow there would be grand doings in the groves generally , and at the ti in particular ; and urged me by no means to absent myself . in commemoration of what event , however , or in honour of what distinguished personage , the feast was to be given , altogether passed my comprehension . mehevi sought to enlighten my ignorance , but he failed as signally as when he had endeavoured to initiate me into the perplexing arcana of the taboo .
melville	typee	on leaving the ti , kory-kory , who had as a matter of course accompanied me , observing that my curiosity remained unabated , resolved to make everything plain and satisfactory . with this intent , he escorted me through the taboo groves , pointing out to my notice a variety of objects , and endeavoured to explain them in such an indescribable jargon of words , that it almost put me in bodily pain to listen to him . in particular , he led me to a remarkable pyramidical structure some three yards square at the base , and perhaps ten feet in height , which had lately been thrown up , and occupied a very conspicuous position . it was composed principally of large empty calabashes , with a few polished cocoanut shells , and looked not unlike a cenotaph of skulls . my cicerone perceived the astonishment with which i gazed at this monument of savage crockery , and immediately addressed himself in the task of enlightening me : but all in vain ; and to this hour the nature of the monument remains a complete mystery to me . as , however , it formed so prominent a feature in the approaching revels , i bestowed upon the latter , in my own mind , the title of the ‘ feast of calabashes ’ .
melville	typee	the following morning , awaking rather late , i perceived the whole of marheyo ’ s family busily engaged in preparing for the festival . the old warrior himself was arranging in round balls the two grey locks of hair that were suffered to grow from the crown of his head ; his earrings and spear , both well polished , lay beside him , while the highly decorative pair of shoes hung suspended from a projecting cane against the side of the house . the young men were similarly employed ; and the fair damsels , including fayaway , were anointing themselves with ‘ aka ’ , arranging their long tresses , and performing other matters connected with the duties of the toilet .
melville	typee	having completed their preparations , the girls now exhibited themselves in gala costume ; the most conspicuous feature of which was a necklace of beautiful white flowers , with the stems removed , and strung closely together upon a single fibre of tappa . corresponding ornaments were inserted in their ears , and woven garlands upon their heads . about their waist they wore a short tunic of spotless white tappa , and some of them super-added to this a mantle of the same material , tied in an elaborate bow upon the left shoulder , and falling about the figure in picturesque folds .
melville	typee	thus arrayed , i would have matched the charming fayaway against any beauty in the world . people may say what they will about the taste evinced by our fashionable ladies in dress . their jewels , their feathers , their silks , and their furbelows , would have sunk into utter insignificance beside the exquisite simplicity of attire adopted by the nymphs of the vale on this festive occasion . i should like to have seen a gallery of coronation beauties , at westminster abbey , confronted for a moment by this band of island girls ; their stiffness , formality , and affectation , contrasted with the artless vivacity and unconcealed natural graces of these savage maidens . it would be the venus de ’ medici placed beside a milliner ’ s doll . it was not long before kory-kory and myself were left alone in the house , the rest of its inmates having departed for the taboo groves . my valet was all impatience to follow them ; and was as fidgety about my dilatory movements as a diner out waiting hat in hand at the bottom of the stairs for some lagging companion . at last , yielding to his importunities , i set out for the ti . as we passed the houses peeping out from the groves through which our route lay , i noticed that they were entirely deserted by their inhabitants .
melville	typee	when we reached the rock that abruptly terminated the path , and concealed from us the festive scene , wild shouts and a confused blending of voices assured me that the occasion , whatever it might be , had drawn together a great multitude . kory-kory , previous to mounting the elevation , paused for a moment , like a dandy at a ball-room door , to put a hasty finish to his toilet . during this short interval , the thought struck me that i ought myself perhaps to be taking some little pains with my appearance .
melville	typee	but as i had no holiday raiment , i was not a little puzzled to devise some means of decorating myself . however , as i felt desirous to create a sensation , i determined to do all that lay in my power ; and knowing that i could not delight the savages more than by conforming to their style of dress , i removed from my person the large robe of tappa which i was accustomed to wear over my shoulders whenever i sallied into the open air , and remained merely girt about with a short tunic descending from my waist to my knees .
melville	typee	my quick-witted attendant fully appreciated the compliment i was paying to the costume of his race , and began more sedulously to arrange the folds of the one only garment which remained to me . whilst he was doing this , i caught sight of a knot of young lasses , who were sitting near us on the grass surrounded by heaps of flowers which they were forming into garlands . i motioned to them to bring some of their handywork to me ; and in an instant a dozen wreaths were at my disposal . one of them i put round the apology for a hat which i had been forced to construct for myself out of palmetto-leaves , and some of the others i converted into a splendid girdle . these operations finished , with the slow and dignified step of a full-dressed beau i ascended the rock .
melville	typee	chapter twenty-three the feast of calabashes the whole population of the valley seemed to be gathered within the precincts of the grove . in the distance could be seen the long front of the ti , its immense piazza swarming with men , arrayed in every variety of fantastic costume , and all vociferating with animated gestures ; while the whole interval between it and the place where i stood was enlivened by groups of females fancifully decorated , dancing , capering , and uttering wild exclamations . as soon as they descried me they set up a shout of welcome ; and a band of them came dancing towards me , chanting as they approached some wild recitative . the change in my garb seemed to transport them with delight , and clustering about me on all sides , they accompanied me towards the ti . when however we drew near it these joyous nymphs paused in their career , and parting on either side , permitted me to pass on to the now densely thronged building .
melville	typee	so soon as i mounted to the pi-pi i saw at a glance that the revels were fairly under way . what lavish plenty reigned around ? -- warwick feasting his retainers with beef and ale , was a niggard to the noble mehevi ! -- all along the piazza of the ti were arranged elaborately carved canoe-shaped vessels , some twenty feet in length , tied with newly made poee-poee , and sheltered from the sun by the broad leaves of the banana . at intervals were heaps of green bread-fruit , raised in pyramidical stacks , resembling the regular piles of heavy shot to be seen in the yard of an arsenal . inserted into the interstices of the huge stones which formed the pi-pi were large boughs of trees ; hanging from the branches of which , and screened from the sun by their foliage , were innumerable little packages with leafy coverings , containing the meat of the numerous hogs which had been slain , done up in this manner to make it more accessible to the crowd . leaning against the railing on the piazza were an immense number of long , heavy bamboos , plugged at the lower end , and with their projecting muzzles stuffed with a wad of leaves . these were filled with water from the stream , and each of them might hold from four to five gallons .
melville	typee	the banquet being thus spread , naught remained but for everyone to help himself at his pleasure . accordingly not a moment passed but the transplanted boughs i have mentioned were rifled by the throng of the fruit they certainly had never borne before . calabashes of poee-poee were continually being replenished from the extensive receptacle in which that article was stored , and multitudes of little fires were kindled about the ti for the purpose of roasting the bread-fruit .
melville	typee	within the building itself was presented a most extraordinary scene . the immense lounge of mats lying between the parallel rows of the trunks of cocoanut trees , and extending the entire length of the house , at least two hundred feet , was covered by the reclining forms of a host of chiefs and warriors who were eating at a great rate , or soothing the cares of polynesian life in the sedative fumes of tobacco . the smoke was inhaled from large pipes , the bowls of which , made out of small cocoanut shells , were curiously carved in strange heathenish devices . these were passed from mouth to mouth by the recumbent smokers , each of whom , taking two or three prodigious whiffs , handed the pipe to his neighbour ; sometimes for that purpose stretching indolently across the body of some dozing individual whose exertions at the dinner-table had already induced sleep .
melville	typee	the tobacco used among the typees was of a very mild and pleasing flavour , and as i always saw it in leaves , and the natives appeared pretty well supplied with it , i was led to believe that it must have been the growth of the valley . indeed kory-kory gave me to understand that this was the case ; but i never saw a single plant growing on the island . at nukuheva , and , i believe , in all the other valleys , the weed is very scarce , being only obtained in small quantities from foreigners , and smoking is consequently with the inhabitants of these places a very great luxury . how it was that the typees were so well furnished with it i can not divine . i should think them too indolent to devote any attention to its culture ; and , indeed , as far as my observation extended , not a single atom of the soil was under any other cultivation than that of shower and sunshine . the tobacco-plant , however , like the sugar-cane , may grow wild in some remote part of the vale .
melville	typee	there were many in the ti for whom the tobacco did not furnish a sufficient stimulus , and who accordingly had recourse to ‘ arva ’ , as a more powerful agent in producing the desired effect .
melville	typee	‘ arva ’ is a root very generally dispersed over the south seas , and from it is extracted a juice , the effects of which upon the system are at first stimulating in a moderate degree ; but it soon relaxes the muscles , and exerting a narcotic influence produces a luxurious sleep . in the valley this beverage was universally prepared in the following way : -- some half-dozen young boys seated themselves in a circle around an empty wooden vessel , each one of them being supplied with a certain quantity of the roots of the ‘ arva ’ , broken into small bits and laid by his side . a cocoanut goblet of water was passed around the juvenile company , who rinsing their mouths with its contents , proceeded to the business before them . this merely consisted in thoroughly masticating the ‘ arva ’ , and throwing it mouthful after mouthful into the receptacle provided . when a sufficient quantity had been thus obtained water was poured upon the mass , and being stirred about with the forefinger of the right hand , the preparation was soon in readiness for use . the ‘ arva ’ has medicinal qualities .
melville	typee	upon the sandwich islands it has been employed with no small success in the treatment of scrofulous affections , and in combating the ravages of a disease for whose frightful inroads the ill-starred inhabitants of that group are indebted to their foreign benefactors . but the tenants of the typee valley , as yet exempt from these inflictions , generally employ the ‘ arva ’ as a minister to social enjoyment , and a calabash of the liquid circulates among them as the bottle with us .
melville	typee	mehevi , who was greatly delighted with the change in my costume , gave me a cordial welcome . he had reserved for me a most delectable mess of ‘ cokoo ’ , well knowing my partiality for that dish ; and had likewise selected three or four young cocoanuts , several roasted bread-fruit , and a magnificent bunch of bananas , for my especial comfort and gratification . these various matters were at once placed before me ; but kory-kory deemed the banquet entirely insufficient for my wants until he had supplied me with one of the leafy packages of pork , which , notwithstanding the somewhat hasty manner in which it had been prepared , possessed a most excellent flavour , and was surprisingly sweet and tender .
melville	typee	pork is not a staple article of food among the people of the marquesas ; consequently they pay little attention to the breeding of the swine . the hogs are permitted to roam at large on the groves , where they obtain no small part of their nourishment from the cocoanuts which continually fall from the trees . but it is only after infinite labour and difficulty , that the hungry animal can pierce the husk and shell so as to get at the meat . i have frequently been amused at seeing one of them , after crunching the obstinate nut with his teeth for a long time unsuccessfully , get into a violent passion with it . he would then root furiously under the cocoanut , and , with a fling of his snout , toss it before him on the ground . following it up , he would crunch at it again savagely for a moment , and then next knock it on one side , pausing immediately after , as if wondering how it could so suddenly have disappeared . in this way the persecuted cocoanuts were often chased half across the valley .
melville	typee	the second day of the feast of calabashes was ushered in by still more uproarious noises than the first . the skins of innumerable sheep seemed to be resounding to the blows of an army of drummers . startled from my slumbers by the din , i leaped up , and found the whole household engaged in making preparations for immediate departure . curious to discover of what strange events these novel sounds might be the precursors , and not a little desirous to catch a sight of the instruments which produced the terrific noise , i accompanied the natives as soon as they were in readiness to depart for the taboo groves .
melville	typee	the comparatively open space that extended from the ti toward the rock , to which i have before alluded as forming the ascent to the place , was , with the building itself , now altogether deserted by the men ; the whole distance being filled by bands of females , shouting and dancing under the influence of some strange excitement .
melville	typee	i was amused at the appearance of four or five old women who , in a state of utter nudity , with their arms extended flatly down their sides , and holding themselves perfectly erect , were leaping stiffly into the air , like so many sticks bobbing to the surface , after being pressed perpendicularly into the water . they preserved the utmost gravity of countenance , and continued their extraordinary movements without a single moment ’ s cessation . they did not appear to attract the observation of the crowd around them , but i must candidly confess that for my own part , i stared at them most pertinaciously .
melville	typee	desirous of being enlightened in regard to the meaning of this peculiar diversion , i turned , inquiringly to kory-kory ; that learned typee immediately proceeded to explain the whole matter thoroughly . but all that i could comprehend from what he said was , that the leaping figures before me were bereaved widows , whose partners had been slain in battle many moons previously ; and who , at every festival , gave public evidence in this manner of their calamities . it was evident that kory-kory considered this an all-sufficient reason for so indecorous a custom ; but i must say that it did not satisfy me as to its propriety .
melville	typee	leaving these afflicted females , we passed on to the hoolah hoolah ground . within the spacious quadrangle , the whole population of the valley seemed to be assembled , and the sight presented was truly remarkable . beneath the sheds of bamboo which opened towards the interior of the square reclined the principal chiefs and warriors , while a miscellaneous throng lay at their ease under the enormous trees which spread a majestic canopy overhead . upon the terraces of the gigantic altars , at each end , were deposited green bread-fruit in baskets of cocoanut leaves , large rolls of tappa , bunches of ripe bananas , clusters of mammee-apples , the golden-hued fruit of the artu-tree , and baked hogs , laid out in large wooden trenchers , fancifully decorated with freshly plucked leaves , whilst a variety of rude implements of war were piled in confused heaps before the ranks of hideous idols . fruits of various kinds were likewise suspended in leafen baskets , from the tops of poles planted uprightly , and at regular intervals , along the lower terraces of both altars . at their base were arranged two parallel rows of cumbersome drums , standing at least fifteen feet in height , and formed from the hollow trunks of large trees . their heads were covered with shark skins , and their barrels were elaborately carved with various quaint figures and devices . at regular intervals they were bound round by a species of sinnate of various colours , and strips of native cloth flattened upon them here and there . behind these instruments were built slight platforms , upon which stood a number of young men who , beating violently with the palms of their hands upon the drum-heads , produced those outrageous sounds which had awakened me in the morning . every few minutes these musical performers hopped down from their elevation into the crowd below , and their places were immediately supplied by fresh recruits . thus an incessant din was kept up that might have startled pandemonium .
melville	typee	precisely in the middle of the quadrangle were placed perpendicularly in the ground , a hundred or more slender , fresh-cut poles , stripped of their bark , and decorated at the end with a floating pennon of white tappa ; the whole being fenced about with a little picket of canes . for what purpose these angular ornaments were intended i in vain endeavoured to discover .
melville	typee	another most striking feature of the performance was exhibited by a score of old men , who sat cross-legged in the little pulpits , which encircled the trunks of the immense trees growing in the middle of the enclosure . these venerable gentlemen , who i presume were the priests , kept up an uninterrupted monotonous chant , which was partly drowned in the roar of drums . in the right hand they held a finely woven grass fan , with a heavy black wooden handle curiously chased : these fans they kept in continual motion .
melville	typee	but no attention whatever seemed to be paid to the drummers or to the old priests ; the individuals who composed the vast crowd present being entirely taken up in chanting and laughing with one another , smoking , drinking ‘ arva ’ , and eating . for all the observation it attracted , or the good it achieved , the whole savage orchestra might with great advantage to its own members and the company in general , have ceased the prodigious uproar they were making .
melville	typee	in vain i questioned kory-kory and others of the natives , as to the meaning of the strange things that were going on ; all their explanations were conveyed in such a mass of outlandish gibberish and gesticulation that i gave up the attempt in despair . all that day the drums resounded , the priests chanted , and the multitude feasted and roared till sunset , when the throng dispersed , and the taboo groves were again abandoned to quiet and repose . the next day the same scene was repeated until night , when this singular festival terminated .
melville	typee	chapter twenty-four ideas suggested by the feast of calabashes -- inaccuracy of certain published accounts of the islands -- a reason -- neglected state of heathenism in the valley -- effigy of a dead warrior -- a singular superstition -- the priest kolory and the god moa artua -- amazing religious observance -- a dilapidated shrine -- kory-kory and the idol -- an inference
melville	typee	although i had been baffled in my attempts to learn the origin of the feast of calabashes , yet it seemed very plain to me that it was principally , if not wholly , of a religious character . as a religious solemnity , however , it had not at all corresponded with the horrible descriptions of polynesian worship which we have received in some published narratives , and especially in those accounts of the evangelized islands with which the missionaries have favoured us . did not the sacred character of these persons render the purity of their intentions unquestionable , i should certainly be led to suppose that they had exaggerated the evils of paganism , in order to enhance the merit of their own disinterested labours .
melville	typee	in a certain work incidentally treating of the ‘ washington , or northern marquesas islands , ’ i have seen the frequent immolation of human victims upon the altars of their gods , positively and repeatedly charged upon the inhabitants . the same work gives also a rather minute account of their religion -- enumerates a great many of their superstitions -- and makes known the particular designations of numerous orders of the priesthood . one would almost imagine from the long list that is given of cannibal primates , bishops , arch-deacons , prebendaries , and other inferior ecclesiastics , that the sacerdotal order far outnumbered the rest of the population , and that the poor natives were more severely priest-ridden than even the inhabitants of the papal states . these accounts are likewise calculated to leave upon the reader ’ s mind an impression that human victims are daily cooked and served up upon the altars ; that heathenish cruelties of every description are continually practised ; and that these ignorant pagans are in a state of the extremest wretchedness in consequence of the grossness of their superstitions . be it observed , however , that all this information is given by a man who , according to his own statement , was only at one of the islands , and remained there but two weeks , sleeping every night on board his ship , and taking little kid-glove excursions ashore in the daytime , attended by an armed party .
melville	typee	now , all i can say is , that in all my excursions through the valley of typee , i never saw any of these alleged enormities . if any of them are practised upon the marquesas islands they must certainly have come to my knowledge while living for months with a tribe of savages , wholly unchanged from their original primitive condition , and reputed the most ferocious in the south seas .
melville	typee	the fact is , that there is a vast deal of unintentional humbuggery in some of the accounts we have from scientific men concerning the religious institutions of polynesia . these learned tourists generally obtain the greater part of their information from retired old south-sea rovers , who have domesticated themselves among the barbarous tribes of the pacific . jack , who has long been accustomed to the long-bow , and to spin tough yarns on the ship ’ s forecastle , invariably officiates as showman of the island on which he has settled , and having mastered a few dozen words of the language , is supposed to know all about the people who speak it . a natural desire to make himself of consequence in the eyes of the strangers , prompts him to lay claim to a much greater knowledge of such matters than he actually possesses . in reply to incessant queries , he communicates not only all he knows but a good deal more , and if there be any information deficient still he is at no loss to supply it . the avidity with which his anecdotes are noted down tickles his vanity , and his powers of invention increase with the credulity auditors . he knows just the sort of information wanted , and furnishes it to any extent .
melville	typee	this is not a supposed case ; i have met with several individuals like the one described , and i have been present at two or three of their interviews with strangers .
melville	typee	now , when the scientific voyager arrives at home with his collection of wonders , he attempts , perhaps , to give a description of some of the strange people he has been visiting . instead of representing them as a community of lusty savages , who are leading a merry , idle , innocent life , he enters into a very circumstantial and learned narrative of certain unaccountable superstitions and practices , about which he knows as little as the islanders themselves . having had little time , and scarcely any opportunity , to become acquainted with the customs he pretends to describe , he writes them down one after another in an off-hand , haphazard style ; and were the book thus produced to be translated into the tongue of the people of whom it purports to give the history , it would appear quite as wonderful to them as it does to the american public , and much more improbable .
melville	typee	for my own part , i am free to confess my almost entire inability to gratify any curiosity that may be felt with regard to the theology of the valley . i doubt whether the inhabitants themselves could do so . they are either too lazy or too sensible to worry themselves about abstract points of religious belief . while i was among them , they never held any synods or councils to settle the principles of their faith by agitating them . an unbounded liberty of conscience seemed to prevail . those who pleased to do so were allowed to repose implicit faith in an ill-favoured god with a large bottle-nose and fat shapeless arms crossed upon his breast ; whilst others worshipped an image which , having no likeness either in heaven or on earth , could hardly be called an idol . as the islanders always maintained a discreet reserve with regard to my own peculiar views on religion , i thought it would be excessively ill-bred of me to pry into theirs .
melville	typee	but , although my knowledge of the religious faith of the typees was unavoidably limited , one of their superstitious observances with which i became acquainted interested me greatly . in one of the most secluded portions of the valley within a stone ’ s cast of fayaway ’ s lake -- for so i christened the scene of our island yachting -- and hard by a growth of palms , which stood ranged in order along both banks of the stream , waving their green arms as if to do honour to its passage , was the mausoleum of a deceased , warrior chief . like all the other edifices of any note , it was raised upon a small pi-pi of stones , which , being of unusual height , was a conspicuous object from a distance . a light thatching of bleached palmetto-leaves hung over it like a self supported canopy ; for it was not until you came very near that you saw it was supported by four slender columns of bamboo rising at each corner to a little more than the height of a man . a clear area of a few yards surrounded the pi-pi , and was enclosed by four trunks of cocoanut trees resting at the angles on massive blocks of stone . the place was sacred . the sign of the inscrutable taboo was seen in the shape of a mystic roll of white tappa , suspended by a twisted cord of the same material from the top of a slight pole planted within the enclosure * . the sanctity of the spot appeared never to have been violated . the stillness of the grave was there , and the calm solitude around was beautiful and touching . the soft shadows of those lofty palm-trees ! -- i can see them now -- hanging over the little temple , as if to keep out the intrusive sun .
melville	typee	* white appears to be the sacred colour among the marquesans . on all sides as you approached this silent spot you caught sight of the dead chief ’ s effigy , seated in the stern of a canoe , which was raised on a light frame a few inches above the level of the pi-pi . the canoe was about seven feet in length ; of a rich , dark coloured wood , handsomely carved and adorned in many places with variegated bindings of stained sinnate , into which were ingeniously wrought a number of sparkling seashells , and a belt of the same shells ran all round it . the body of the figure -- of whatever material it might have been made -- was effectually concealed in a heavy robe of brown tappa , revealing ; only the hands and head ; the latter skilfully carved in wood , and surmounted by a superb arch of plumes . these plumes , in the subdued and gentle gales which found access to this sequestered spot , were never for one moment at rest , but kept nodding and waving over the chief ’ s brow . the long leaves of the palmetto drooped over the eaves , and through them you saw the warrior holding his paddle with both hands in the act of rowing , leaning forward and inclining his head , as if eager to hurry on his voyage . glaring at him forever , and face to face , was a polished human skull , which crowned the prow of the canoe . the spectral figurehead , reversed in its position , glancing backwards , seemed to mock the impatient attitude of the warrior .
melville	typee	when i first visited this singular place with kory-kory , he told me -- or at least i so understood him -- that the chief was paddling his way to the realms of bliss , and bread-fruit -- the polynesian heaven -- where every moment the bread-fruit trees dropped their ripened spheres to the ground , and where there was no end to the cocoanuts and bananas : there they reposed through the livelong eternity upon mats much finer than those of typee ; and every day bathed their glowing limbs in rivers of cocoanut oil . in that happy land there were plenty of plumes and feathers , and boars ’ -tusks and sperm-whale teeth , far preferable to all the shining trinkets and gay tappa of the white men ; and , best of all , women far lovelier than the daughters of earth were there in abundance . ‘ a very pleasant place , ’ kory-kory said it was ; ‘ but after all , not much pleasanter , he thought , than typee. ’ ‘ did he not then , ’ i asked him , ‘ wish to accompany the warrior ? ’ ‘ oh no : he was very happy where he was ; but supposed that some time or other he would go in his own canoe . ’
melville	typee	thus far , i think , i clearly comprehended kory-kory . but there was a singular expression he made use of at the time , enforced by as singular a gesture , the meaning of which i would have given much to penetrate . i am inclined to believe it must have been a proverb he uttered ; for i afterwards heard him repeat the same words several times , and in what appeared to me to be a somewhat : similar sense . indeed , kory-kory had a great variety of short , smart-sounding sentences , with which he frequently enlivened his discourse ; and he introduced them with an air which plainly intimated , that in his opinion , they settled the matter in question , whatever it might be .
melville	typee	could it have been then , that when i asked him whether he desired to go to this heaven of bread-fruit , cocoanuts , and young ladies , which he had been describing , he answered by saying something equivalent to our old adage -- ‘ a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush ’ ? -- if he did , kory-kory was a discreet and sensible fellow , and i can not sufficiently admire his shrewdness .
melville	typee	whenever , in the course of my rambles through the valley i happened to be near the chief ’ s mausoleum , i always turned aside to visit it . the place had a peculiar charm for me ; i hardly know why , but so it was . as i leaned over the railing and gazed upon the strange effigy and watched the play of the feathery head-dress , stirred by the same breeze which in low tones breathed amidst the lofty palm-trees , i loved to yield myself up to the fanciful superstition of the islanders , and could almost believe that the grim warrior was bound heavenward . in this mood when i turned to depart , i bade him ‘ god speed , and a pleasant voyage. ’ aye , paddle away , brave chieftain , to the land of spirits ! to the material eye thou makest but little progress ; but with the eye of faith , i see thy canoe cleaving the bright waves , which die away on those dimly looming shores of paradise .
melville	typee	this strange superstition affords another evidence of the fact , that however ignorant man may be , he still feels within him his immortal spirit yearning , after the unknown future . although the religious theories of the islands were a complete mystery to me , their practical every-day operation could not be concealed . i frequently passed the little temples reposing in the shadows of the taboo groves and beheld the offerings -- mouldy fruit spread out upon a rude altar , or hanging in half-decayed baskets around some uncouth jolly-looking image ; i was present during the continuance of the festival ; i daily beheld the grinning idols marshalled rank and file in the hoolah hoolah ground , and was often in the habit of meeting those whom i supposed to be the priests . but the temples seemed to be abandoned to solitude ; the festival had been nothing more than a jovial mingling of the tribe ; the idols were quite harmless as any other logs of wood ; and the priests were the merriest dogs in the valley .
melville	omoo	chapter xlii . motoo-otoo a tahitian casuist the pill box was sometimes employed for other purposes than that described in the last chapter . we sometimes went a-pleasuring in it . right in the middle of papeetee harbour is a bright , green island , one circular grove of waving palms , and scarcely a hundred yards across . it is of coral formation ; and all round , for many rods out , the bay is so shallow that you might wade anywhere . down in these waters , as transparent as air , you see coral plants of every hue and shape imaginable : —antlers , tufts of azure , waving reeds like stalks of grain , and pale green buds and mosses . in some places , you look through prickly branches down to a snow-white floor of sand , sprouting with flinty bulbs ; and crawling among these are strange shapes : —some bristling with spikes , others clad in shining coats of mail , and here and there , round forms all spangled with eyes .
melville	omoo	the island is called hotoo-otoo ; and around hotoo-otoo have i often paddled of a white moonlight night , pausing now and then to admire the marine gardens beneath . the place is the private property of the queen , who has a residence there—a melancholy-looking range of bamboo houses—neglected and falling to decay among the trees .
melville	omoo	commanding the harbour as it does , her majesty has done all she could to make a fortress of the island . the margin has been raised and levelled , and built up with a low parapet of hewn hocks of coral . behind the parapet are ranged , at wide intervals , a number of rusty old cannon , of all fashions and calibres . they are mounted upon lame , decrepit-looking carriages , ready to sink under the useless burden of bearing them up . indeed , two or three have given up the ghost altogether , and the pieces they sustained lie half buried among their bleaching bones . several of the cannon are spiked ; probably with a view of making them more formidable ; as they certainly must be to anyone undertaking to fire them off .
melville	omoo	presented to pomaree at various times by captains of british armed ships , these poor old “ dogs of war , ” thus toothless and turned out to die , formerly bayed in full pack as the battle-hounds of old england .
melville	omoo	there was something about hotoo-otoo that struck my fancy ; and i registered a vow to plant my foot upon its soil , notwithstanding an old bareheaded sentry menaced me in the moonlight with an unsightly musket . as my canoe drew scarcely three inches of water , i could paddle close up to the parapet without grounding ; but every time i came near , the old man ran toward me , pushing his piece forward , but never clapping it to his shoulder . thinking he only meant to frighten me , i at last dashed the canoe right up to the wall , purposing a leap . it was the rashest act of my life ; for never did cocoa-nut come nearer getting demolished than mine did then . with the stock of his gun , the old warder fetched a tremendous blow , which i managed to dodge ; and then falling back , succeeded in paddling out of harm ’ s reach .
melville	omoo	he must have been dumb ; for never a word did he utter ; but grinning from ear to ear , and with his white cotton robe streaming in the moonlight , he looked more like the spook of the island than anything mortal .
melville	omoo	i tried to effect my object by attacking him in the rear—but he was all front ; running about the place as i paddled , and presenting his confounded musket wherever i went . at last i was obliged to retreat ; and to this day my vow remains unfulfilled .
melville	omoo	it was a few days after my repulse from before the walls of hotoo-otoo that i heard a curious case of casuistry argued between one of the most clever and intelligent natives i ever saw in tahiti , a man by the name of arheetoo , and our learned theban of a doctor .
melville	omoo	it was this : —whether it was right and lawful for anyone , being a native , to keep the european sabbath , in preference to the day set apart as such by the missionaries , and so considered by the islanders in general .
melville	omoo	it must be known that the missionaries of the good ship duff , who more than half-a-century ago established the tahitian reckoning , came hither by the way of the cape of good hope ; and by thus sailing to the eastward , lost one precious day of their lives all round , getting about that much in advance of greenwich time . for this reason , vessels coming round cape horn—as they most all do nowadays—find it sunday in tahiti , when , according to their own view of the matter , it ought to be saturday . but as it won ’ t do to alter the log , the sailors keep their sabbath , and the islanders theirs .
melville	omoo	this confusion perplexes the poor natives mightily ; and it is to no purpose that you endeavour to explain so incomprehensible a phenomenon . i once saw a worthy old missionary essay to shed some light on the subject ; and though i understood but a few of the words employed , i could easily get at the meaning of his illustrations . they were something like the following :
melville	omoo	“ here , ” says he , “ you see this circle ” ( describing a large one on the ground with a stick ) ; “ very good ; now you see this spot here ” ( marking a point in the perimeter ) : “ well ; this is beretanee ( england ) , and i ’ m going to sail round to tahiti . here i go , then ( following the circle round ) , and there goes the sun ( snatching up another stick , and commissioning a bandy-legged native to travel round with it in a contrary direction ) . now then , we are both off , and both going away from each other ; and here you see i have arrived at tahiti ( making a sudden stop ) ; and look now where bandy legs is ! ”
melville	omoo	but the crowd strenuously maintained that bandy legs ought to be somewhere above them in the atmosphere ; for it was a traditionary fact that the people from the duff came ashore when the sun was high overhead . and here the old gentleman , being a very good sort of man , doubtless , but no astronomer , was obliged to give up .
melville	omoo	arheetoo , the casuist alluded to , though a member of the church , and extremely conscientious about what sabbath he kept , was more liberal in other matters . learning that i was something of a “ mick-onaree ” ( in this sense , a man able to read , and cunning in the use of the pen ) , he desired the slight favour of my forging for him a set of papers ; for which , he said , he would be much obliged , and give me a good dinner of roast pig and indian turnip in the bargain .
melville	omoo	now , arheetoo was one of those who board the shipping for their washing ; and the competition being very great ( the proudest chiefs not disdaining to solicit custom in person , though the work is done by their dependants ) , he had decided upon a course suggested by a knowing sailor , a friend of his . he wished to have manufactured a set of certificates , purporting to come from certain man-of-war and merchant captains , known to have visited the island ; recommending him as one of the best getters up of fine linen in all polynesia .
melville	omoo	at this time , arheetoo had known me but two hours ; and , as he made the proposition very coolly , i thought it rather presumptuous , and told him so . but as it was quite impossible to convey a hint , and there was a slight impropriety in the thing , i did not resent the insult , but simply declined .
melville	omoo	chapter xliii . one is judged by the company he keeps altough , from its novelty , life at captain bob ’ s was pleasant enough , for the time ; there were some few annoyances connected with it anything but agreeable to a “ soul of sensibility . ”
melville	omoo	prejudiced against us by the malevolent representations of the consul and others , many worthy foreigners ashore regarded us as a set of lawless vagabonds ; though , truth to speak , better behaved sailors never stepped on the island , nor any who gave less trouble to the natives . but , for all this , whenever we met a respectably-dressed european , ten to one he shunned us by going over to the other side of the road . this was very unpleasant , at least to myself ; though , certes , it did not prey upon the minds of the others .
melville	omoo	to give an instance . of a fine evening in tahiti—but they are all fine evenings there—you may see a bevy of silk bonnets and parasols passing along the broom road : perhaps a band of pale , little white urchins—sickly exotics—and , oftener still , sedate , elderly gentlemen , with canes ; at whose appearance the natives , here and there , slink into their huts . these are the missionaries , their wives , and children , taking a family airing . sometimes , by the bye , they take horse , and ride down to point venus and back ; a distance of several miles . at this place is settled the only survivor of the first missionaries that landed—an old , white-headed , saint-like man , by the name of wilson , the father of our friend , the consul .
melville	omoo	the little parties on foot were frequently encountered ; and , recalling , as they did , so many pleasant recollections of home and the ladies , i really longed for a dress coat and beaver that i might step up and pay my respects . but , situated as i was , this was out of the question . on one occasion , however , i received a kind , inquisitive glance from a matron in gingham . sweet lady ! i have not forgotten her : her gown was a plaid .
melville	omoo	but a glance , like hers , was not always bestowed . one evening , passing the verandah of a missionary ’ s dwelling , the dame , his wife , and a pretty , blonde young girl , with ringlets , were sitting there , enjoying the sea-breeze , then coming in , all cool and refreshing , from the spray of the reef . as i approached , the old lady peered hard at me ; and her very cap seemed to convey a prim rebuke . the blue , english eyes , by her side , were also bent on me . but , oh heavens ! what a glance to receive from such a beautiful creature ! as for the mob cap , not a fig did i care for it ; but , to be taken for anything but a cavalier , by the ringleted one , was absolutely unendurable .
melville	omoo	i resolved on a courteous salute , to show my good-breeding , if nothing more . but , happening to wear a sort of turban—hereafter to be particularly alluded to—there was no taking it off and putting it on again with anything like dignity . at any rate , then , here goes a how . but , another difficulty presented itself ; my loose frock was so voluminous that i doubted whether any spinal curvature would be perceptible .
melville	omoo	“ good evening , ladies , ” exclaimed i , at last , advancing winningly ; “ a delightful air from the sea , ladies. ” hysterics and hartshorn ! who would have thought it ? the young lady screamed , and the old one came near fainting . as for myself , i retreated in double-quick time ; and scarcely drew breath until safely housed in the calabooza .
melville	omoo	chapter xliv . cathedral of papoar—the church of the cocoa-nuts on sundays i always attended the principal native church , on the outskirts of the village of papeetee , and not far from the calabooza beretanee . it was esteemed the best specimen of architecture in tahiti .
melville	omoo	of late , they have built their places of worship with more reference to durability than formerly . at one time , there were no less than thirty-six on the island—mere barns , tied together with thongs , which went to destruction in a very few years .
melville	omoo	one , built many years ago in this style , was a most remarkable structure . it was erected by pomaree ii. , who , on this occasion , showed all the zeal of a royal proselyte . the building was over seven hundred feet in length , and of a proportionate width ; the vast ridge-pole was at intervals supported by a row of thirty-six cylindrical trunks of the bread-fruit tree ; and , all round , the wall-plates rested on shafts of the palm . the roof—steeply inclining to within a man ’ s height of the ground—was thatched with leaves , and the sides of the edifice were open . thus spacious was the royal mission chapel of papoar .
melville	omoo	at its dedication , three distinct sermons were , from different pulpits , preached to an immense concourse gathered from all parts of the island . as the chapel was built by the king ’ s command , nearly as great a multitude was employed in its construction as swarmed over the scaffolding of the great temple of the jews . much less time , however , was expended . in less than three weeks from planting the first post , the last tier of palmetto-leaves drooped from the eaves , and the work was done .
melville	omoo	apportioned to the several chiefs and their dependants , the labour , though immense , was greatly facilitated by everyone ’ s bringing his post , or his rafter , or his pole strung with thatching , ready for instant use . the materials thus prepared being afterwards secured together by thongs , there was literally “ neither hammer , nor axe , nor any tool of iron heard in the house while it was building . ”
melville	omoo	but the most singular circumstance connected with this south sea cathedral remains to be related . as well for the beauty as the advantages of such a site , the islanders love to dwell near the mountain streams ; and so , a considerable brook , after descending from the hills and watering the valley , was bridged over in three places , and swept clean through the chapel .
melville	omoo	flowing waters ! what an accompaniment to the songs of the sanctuary ; mingling with them the praises and thanksgivings of the green solitudes inland . but the chapel of the polynesian solomon has long since been deserted . its thousand rafters of habiscus have decayed , and fallen to the ground ; and now , the stream murmurs over them in its bed .
melville	omoo	the present metropolitan church of tahiti is very unlike the one just described . it is of moderate dimensions , boarded over , and painted white . it is furnished also with blinds , but no sashes ; indeed , were it not for the rustic thatch , it would remind one of a plain chapel at home .
melville	omoo	the woodwork was all done by foreign carpenters , of whom there are always several about papeetee . within , its aspect is unique , and can not fail to interest a stranger . the rafters overhead are bound round with fine matting of variegated dyes ; and all along the ridge-pole these trappings hang pendent , in alternate bunches of tassels and deep fringes of stained grass . the floor is composed of rude planks . regular aisles run between ranges of native settees , bottomed with crossed braids of the cocoa-nut fibre , and furnished with backs .
melville	omoo	but the pulpit , made of a dark , lustrous wood , and standing at one end , is by far the most striking object . it is preposterously lofty ; indeed , a capital bird ’ s-eye view of the congregation ought to be had from its summit .
melville	omoo	nor does the church lack a gallery , which runs round on three sides , and is supported by columns of the cocoa-nut tree . its facings are here and there daubed over with a tawdry blue ; and in other places ( without the slightest regard to uniformity ) , patches of the same colour may be seen . in their ardour to decorate the sanctuary , the converts must have borrowed each a brush full of paint , and zealously daubed away at the first surface that offered .
melville	omoo	as hinted , the general impression is extremely curious . little light being admitted , and everything being of a dark colour , there is an indefinable indian aspect of duskiness throughout . a strange , woody smell , also—more or less pervading every considerable edifice in polynesia—is at once perceptible . it suggests the idea of worm-eaten idols packed away in some old lumber-room at hand .
melville	omoo	for the most part , the congregation attending this church is composed of the better and wealthier orders—the chiefs and their retainers ; in short , the rank and fashion of the island . this class is infinitely superior in personal beauty and general healthfulness to the “ marenhoar , ” or common people ; the latter having been more exposed to the worst and most debasing evils of foreign intercourse . on sundays , the former are invariably arrayed in their finery ; and thus appear to the best advantage . nor are they driven to the chapel , as some of their inferiors are to other places of worship ; on the contrary , capable of maintaining a handsome exterior , and possessing greater intelligence , they go voluntarily .
melville	omoo	in respect of the woodland colonnade supporting its galleries , i called this chapel the church of the cocoa-nuts . it was the first place for christian worship in polynesia that i had seen ; and the impression upon entering during service was all the stronger . majestic-looking chiefs whose fathers had hurled the battle-club , and old men who had seen sacrifices smoking upon the altars of oro , were there . and hark ! hanging from the bough of a bread-fruit tree without , a bell is being struck with a bar of iron by a native lad . in the same spot , the blast of the war-conch had often resounded . but to the proceedings within .
melville	omoo	the place is well filled . everywhere meets the eye the gay calico draperies worn on great occasions by the higher classes , and forming a strange contrast of patterns and colours . in some instances , these are so fashioned as to resemble as much as possible european garments . this is in excessively bad taste . coats and pantaloons , too , are here and there seen ; but they look awkwardly enough , and take away from the general effect .
melville	omoo	but it is the array of countenances that most strikes you . each is suffused with the peculiar animation of the polynesians , when thus collected in large numbers . every robe is rustling , every limb in motion , and an incessant buzzing going on throughout the assembly . the tumult is so great that the voice of the placid old missionary , who now rises , is almost inaudible . some degree of silence is at length obtained through the exertions of half-a-dozen strapping fellows , in white shirts and no pantaloons . running in among the settees , they are at great pains to inculcate the impropriety of making a noise by creating a most unnecessary racket themselves . this part of the service was quite comical .
melville	omoo	there is a most interesting sabbath school connected with the church ; and the scholars , a vivacious , mischievous set , were in one part of the gallery . i was amused by a party in a corner . the teacher sat at one end of the bench , with a meek little fellow by his side . when the others were disorderly , this young martyr received a rap ; intended , probably , as a sample of what the rest might expect , if they didn ’ t amend .
melville	omoo	standing in the body of the church , and leaning against a pillar , was an old man , in appearance very different from others of his countrymen . he wore nothing but a coarse , scant mantle of faded tappa ; and from his staring , bewildered manner , i set him down as an aged bumpkin from the interior , unaccustomed to the strange sights and sounds of the metropolis . this old worthy was sharply reprimanded for standing up , and thus intercepting the view of those behind ; but not comprehending exactly what was said to him , one of the white-liveried gentry made no ceremony of grasping him by the shoulders , and fairly crushing him down into a seat .
melville	omoo	during all this , the old missionary in the pulpit—as well as his associates beneath , never ventured to interfere—leaving everything to native management . with south sea islanders , assembled in any numbers , there is no other way of getting along .
melville	omoo	chapter xlv . missionary ’ s sermon ; with some reflections some degree of order at length restored , the service was continued , by singing . the choir was composed of twelve or fifteen ladies of the mission , occupying a long bench to the left of the pulpit . almost the entire congregation joined in .
melville	omoo	the first air fairly startled me ; it was the brave tune of old hundred , adapted to a tahitian psalm . after the graceless scenes i had recently passed through , this circumstance , with all its accessories , moved me forcibly .
melville	omoo	many voices around were of great sweetness and compass . the singers , also , seemed to enjoy themselves mightily ; some of them pausing , now and then , and looking round , as if to realize the scene more fully . in truth , they sang right joyously , despite the solemnity of the tune .
melville	omoo	the tahitians have much natural talent for singing ; and , on all occasions , are exceedingly fond of it . i have often heard a stave or two of psalmody , hummed over by rakish young fellows , like a snatch from an opera .
melville	omoo	with respect to singing , as in most other matters , the tahitians widely differ from the people of the sandwich islands ; where the parochial flocks may be said rather to heat than sing .
melville	omoo	the psalm concluded , a prayer followed . very considerately , the good old missionary made it short ; for the congregation became fidgety and inattentive as soon as it commenced . a chapter of the tahitian bible was now read ; a text selected ; and the sermon began . it was listened to with more attention than i had anticipated .
melville	omoo	having been informed , from various sources , that the discourses of the missionaries , being calculated to engage the attention of their simple auditors , were , naturally enough , of a rather amusing description to strangers ; in short , that they had much to say about steamboats , lord mayor ’ s coaches , and the way fires are put out in london , i had taken care to provide myself with a good interpreter , in the person of an intelligent hawaiian sailor , whose acquaintance i had made .
melville	omoo	“ now , jack , ” said i , before entering , “ hear every word , and tell me what you can as the missionary goes on. ” jack ’ s was not , perhaps , a critical version of the discourse ; and at the time , i took no notes of what he said . nevertheless , i will here venture to give what i remember of it ; and , as far as possible , in jack ’ s phraseology , so as to lose nothing by a double translation .
melville	omoo	“ good friends , i glad to see you ; and i very well like to have some talk with you to-day . good friends , very bad times in tahiti ; it make me weep . pomaree is gone—the island no more yours , but the wee-wees ’ ( french ) . wicked priests here , too ; and wicked idols in woman ’ s clothes , and brass chains .
melville	omoo	“ good friends , no you speak , or look at them—but i know you won ’ t—they belong to a set of robbers—the wicked wee-wees . soon these bad men be made to go very quick . beretanee ships of thunder come and away they go . but no more ’ bout this now . i speak more by by .
melville	omoo	“ good friends , many whale-ships here now ; and many bad men come in ’ em . no good sailors living—that you know very well . they come here , ’ cause so bad they no keep ’ em home .
melville	omoo	“ my good little girls , no run after sailors—no go where they go ; they harm you . where they come from , no good people talk to ’ em—just like dogs . here , they talk to pomaree , and drink arva with great poofai .
melville	omoo	“ good friends , this very small island , but very wicked , and very poor ; these two go together . why beretanee so great ? because that island good island , and send mickonaree to poor kannaka in beretanee , every man rich : plenty things to buy ; and plenty things to sell . houses bigger than pomaree ’ s , and more grand . everybody , too , ride about in coaches , bigger than hers ; and wear fine tappa every day . ( several luxurious appliances of civilization were here enumerated , and described . )
melville	omoo	“ good friends , little to eat left at my house . schooner from sydney no bring bag of flour : and kannaka no bring pig and fruit enough . mickonaree do great deal for kannaka ; kannaka do little for mickonaree . so , good friends , weave plenty of cocoa-nut baskets , fill ’ em , and bring ’ em to-morrow . ”
melville	omoo	such was the substance of great part of this discourse ; and , whatever may be thought of it , it was specially adapted to the minds of the islanders : who are susceptible to no impressions , except from things palpable , or novel and striking . to them , a dry sermon would be dry indeed .
melville	omoo	the tahitians can hardly ever be said to reflect : they are all impulse ; and so , instead of expounding dogmas , the missionaries give them the large type , pleasing cuts , and short and easy lessons of the primer . hence , anything like a permanent religious impression is seldom or never produced .
melville	omoo	in fact , there is , perhaps , no race upon earth , less disposed , by nature , to the monitions of christianity , than the people of the south seas . and this assertion is made with full knowledge of what is called the “ great revival at the sandwich islands , ” about the year 1836 ; when several thousands were , in the course of a few weeks , admitted into the bosom of the church . but this result was brought about by no sober moral convictions ; as an almost instantaneous relapse into every kind of licentiousness soon after testified . it was the legitimate effect of a morbid feeling , engendered by the sense of severe physical wants , preying upon minds excessively prone to superstition ; and , by fanatical preaching , inflamed into the belief that the gods of the missionaries were taking vengeance upon the wickedness of the land .
melville	omoo	it is a noteworthy fact that those very traits in the tahitians , which induced the london missionary society to regard them as the most promising subjects for conversion , and which led , moreover , to the selection of their island as the very first field for missionary labour , eventually proved the most serious obstruction . an air of softness in their manners , great apparent ingenuousness and docility , at first misled ; but these were the mere accompaniments of an indolence , bodily and mental ; a constitutional voluptuousness ; and an aversion to the least restraint ; which , however fitted for the luxurious state of nature , in the tropics , are the greatest possible hindrances to the strict moralities of christianity .
melville	omoo	added to all this is a quality inherent in polynesians ; and more akin to hypocrisy than anything else . it leads them to assume the most passionate interest in matters for which they really feel little or none whatever ; but in which , those whose power they dread , or whose favour they court , they believe to be at all affected . thus , in their heathen state , the sandwich islanders actually knocked out their teeth , tore their hair , and mangled their bodies with shells , to testify their inconsolable grief at the demise of a high chief , or member of the royal family . and yet , vancouver relates that , on such an occasion , upon which he happened to be present , those apparently the most abandoned to their feelings , immediately assumed the utmost light-heartedness on receiving the present of a penny whistle , or a dutch looking-glass . similar instances , also , have come under my own observation .
melville	omoo	the following is an illustration of the trait alluded to , as occasionally manifested among the converted polynesians . at one of the society islands—baiatair , i believe—the natives , for special reasons , desired to commend themselves particularly to the favour of the missionaries . accordingly , during divine service , many of them behaved in a manner , otherwise unaccountable , and precisely similar to their behaviour as heathens . they pretended to be wrought up to madness by the preaching which they heard . they rolled their eyes ; foamed at the mouth ; fell down in fits ; and so were carried home . yet , strange to relate , all this was deemed the evidence of the power of the most high ; and , as such , was heralded abroad .
melville	omoo	but , to return to the church of the cocoa-nuts . the blessing pronounced , the congregation disperse ; enlivening the broom road with their waving mantles . on either hand , they disappear down the shaded pathways , which lead off from the main route , conducting to hamlets in the groves , or to the little marine villas upon the beach . there is considerable hilarity ; and you would suppose them just from an old-fashioned “ hevar , ” or jolly heathen dance . those who carry bibles swing them carelessly from their arms by cords of sinnate .
melville	omoo	the sabbath is no ordinary day with the tahitians . so far as doing any work is concerned , it is scrupulously observed . the canoes are hauled up on the beach ; the nets are spread to dry . passing by the hen-coop huts on the roadside , you find their occupants idle , as usual ; but less disposed to gossip . after service , repose broods over the whole island ; the valleys reaching inland look stiller than ever .
melville	omoo	in short , it is sunday—their “ taboo day ” ; the very word formerly expressing the sacredness of their pagan observances now proclaiming the sanctity of the christian sabbath . chapter xlvi . something about the kannakippers
melville	omoo	a worthy young man , formerly a friend of mine ( i speak of kooloo with all possible courtesy , since after our intimacy there would be an impropriety in doing otherwise ) —this worthy youth , having some genteel notions of retirement , dwelt in a “ maroo boro , ” or bread-fruit shade , a pretty nook in a wood , midway between the calabooza beretanee and the church of cocoa-nuts . hence , at the latter place , he was one of the most regular worshippers .
melville	omoo	kooloo was a blade . standing up in the congregation in all the bravery of a striped calico shirt , with the skirts rakishly adjusted over a pair of white sailor trousers , and hair well anointed with cocoa-nut oil , he ogled the ladies with an air of supreme satisfaction . nor were his glances unreturned .
melville	omoo	but such looks as the tahitian belles cast at each other : frequently turning up their noses at the advent of a new cotton mantle recently imported in the chest of some amorous sailor . upon one occasion , i observed a group of young girls , in tunics of course , soiled sheeting , disdainfully pointing at a damsel in a flaming red one . “ oee tootai owree ! ” said they with ineffable scorn , “ itai maitai ! ” ( you are a good-for-nothing huzzy , no better than you should be ) .
melville	omoo	now , kooloo communed with the church ; so did all these censorious young ladies . yet after eating bread-fruit at the eucharist , i knew several of them , the same night , to be guilty of some sad derelictions .
melville	omoo	puzzled by these things , i resolved to find out , if possible , what ideas , if any , they entertained of religion ; but as one ’ s spiritual concerns are rather delicate for a stranger to meddle with , i went to work as adroitly as i could .
melville	omoo	farnow , an old native who had recently retired from active pursuits , having thrown up the business of being a sort of running footman to the queen , had settled down in a snug little retreat , not fifty rods from captain bob ’ s . his selecting our vicinity for his residence may have been with some view to the advantages it afforded for introducing his three daughters into polite circles . at any rate , not averse to receiving the attentions of so devoted a gallant as the doctor , the sisters ( communicants , be it remembered ) kindly extended to him free permission to visit them sociably whenever he pleased .
melville	omoo	we dropped in one evening , and found the ladies at home . my long friend engaged his favourites , the two younger girls , at the game of “ now , ” or hunting a stone under three piles of tappa . for myself , i lounged on a mat with ideea the eldest , dallying with her grass fan , and improving my knowledge of tahitian .
melville	omoo	the occasion was well adapted to my purpose , and i began . “ ah , ideea , mickonaree oee ? ” the same as drawling out— “ by the bye , miss ideea , do you belong to the church ? ”
melville	omoo	“ yes , me mickonaree , ” was the reply . but the assertion was at once qualified by certain , reservations ; so curious that i can not forbear their relation . “ mickonaree ena ” ( church member here ) , exclaimed she , laying her hand upon her mouth , and a strong emphasis on the adverb . in the same way , and with similar exclamations , she touched her eyes and hands . this done , her whole air changed in an instant ; and she gave me to understand , by unmistakable gestures , that in certain other respects she was not exactly a “ mickonaree. ” in short , ideea was
melville	omoo	“ a sad good christian at the heart—a very heathen in the carnal part. ” the explanation terminated in a burst of laughter , in which all three sisters joined ; and for fear of looking silly , the doctor and myself . as soon as good-breeding would permit , we took leave .
melville	omoo	the hypocrisy in matters of religion , so apparent in all polynesian converts , is most injudiciously nourished in tahiti by a zealous and in many cases , a coercive superintendence over their spiritual well-being . but it is only manifested with respect to the common people , their superiors being exempted .
melville	omoo	on sunday mornings , when the prospect is rather small for a full house in the minor churches , a parcel of fellows are actually sent out with ratans into the highways and byways as whippers-in of the congregation . this is a sober fact .
melville	omoo	these worthies constitute a religious police ; and you always know them by the great white diapers they wear . on week days they are quite as busy as on sundays ; to the great terror of the inhabitants , going all over the island , and spying out the wickedness thereof .
melville	omoo	moreover , they are the collectors of fines—levied generally in grass mats—for obstinate non-attendance upon divine worship , and other offences amenable to the ecclesiastical judicature of the missionaries . old bob called these fellows “ kannakippers ” a corruption , i fancy , of our word constable .
melville	omoo	he bore them a bitter grudge ; and one day , drawing near home , and learning that two of them were just then making a domiciliary visit at his house , he ran behind a bush ; and as they came forth , two green bread-fruit from a hand unseen took them each between the shoulders . the sailors in the calabooza were witnesses to this , as well as several natives ; who , when the intruders were out of sight , applauded captain bob ’ s spirit in no measured terms ; the ladies present vehemently joining in . indeed , the kannakippers have no greater enemies than the latter . and no wonder : the impertinent varlets , popping into their houses at all hours , are forever prying into their peccadilloes .
melville	omoo	kooloo , who at times was patriotic and pensive , and mourned the evils under which his country was groaning , frequently inveighed against the statute which thus authorized an utter stranger to interfere with domestic arrangements . he himself—quite a ladies ’ man—had often been annoyed thereby . he considered the kannakippers a bore .
melville	omoo	beside their confounded inquisitiveness , they add insult to injury , by making a point of dining out every day at some hut within the limits of their jurisdiction . as for the gentleman of the house , his meek endurance of these things is amazing . but “ good easy man , ” there is nothing for him but to be as hospitable as possible .
melville	omoo	these gentry are indefatigable . at the dead of night prowling round the houses , and in the daytime hunting amorous couples in the groves . yet in one instance the chase completely baffled them .
melville	omoo	it was thus . several weeks previous to our arrival at the island , someone ’ s husband and another person ’ s wife , having taken a mutual fancy for each other , went out for a walk . the alarm was raised , and with hue and cry they were pursued ; but nothing was seen of them again until the lapse of some ninety days ; when we were called out from the calabooza to behold a great mob inclosing the lovers , and escorting them for trial to the village .
melville	omoo	their appearance was most singular . the girdle excepted , they were quite naked ; their hair was long , burned yellow at the ends , and entangled with burrs ; and their bodies scratched and scarred in all directions . it seems that , acting upon the “ love in a cottage ” principle , they had gone right into the interior ; and throwing up a hut in an uninhabited valley , had lived there , until in an unlucky stroll they were observed and captured .
melville	omoo	they were subsequently condemned to make one hundred fathoms of broom road—a six months ’ work , if not more . often , when seated in a house , conversing quietly with its inmates , i have known them betray the greatest confusion at the sudden announcement of a kannakipper ’ s being in sight . to be reported by one of these officials as a “ tootai owree ” ( in general , signifying a bad person or disbeliever in christianity ) , is as much dreaded as the forefinger of titus gates was , levelled at an alleged papist .
melville	omoo	but the islanders take a sly revenge upon them . upon entering a dwelling , the kannakippers oftentimes volunteer a pharisaical prayer-meeting : hence , they go in secret by the name of “ boora-artuas , ” literally , “ pray-to-gods . ”
melville	omoo	chapter xlvii . how they dress in tahiti except where the employment of making “ tappa ” is inflicted as a punishment , the echoes of the cloth-mallet have long since died away in the listless valleys of tahiti . formerly , the girls spent their mornings like ladies at their tambour frames ; now , they are lounged away in almost utter indolence . true , most of them make their own garments ; but this comprises but a stitch or two ; the ladies of the mission , by the bye , being entitled to the credit of teaching them to sew .
melville	omoo	the “ kihee whihenee , ” or petticoat , is a mere breadth of white cotton , or calico ; loosely enveloping the person , from the waist to the feet . fastened simply by a single tuck , or by twisting the upper corners together , this garment frequently becomes disordered ; thus affording an opportunity of being coquettishly adjusted . over the “ kihee , ” they wear a sort of gown , open in front , very loose , and as negligent as you please . the ladies here never dress for dinner .
melville	omoo	but what shall be said of those horrid hats ! fancy a bunch of straw , plaited into the shape of a coal-scuttle , and stuck , bolt upright , on the crown ; with a yard or two of red ribbon flying about like kite-strings . milliners of paris , what would ye say to them ! though made by the natives , they are said to have been first contrived and recommended by the missionaries ’ wives ; a report which , i really trust , is nothing but scandal .
melville	omoo	curious to relate , these things for the head are esteemed exceedingly becoming . the braiding of the straw is one of the few employments of the higher classes ; all of which but minister to the silliest vanity .
melville	omoo	the young girls , however , wholly eschew the hats ; leaving those dowdy old souls , their mothers , to make frights of themselves . as for the men , those who aspire to european garments seem to have no perception of the relation subsisting between the various parts of a gentleman ’ s costume . to the wearer of a coat , for instance , pantaloons are by no means indispensable ; and a bell-crowned hat and a girdle are full dress . the young sailor , for whom kooloo deserted me , presented him with a shaggy old pea-jacket ; and with this buttoned up to his chin , under a tropical sun , he promenaded the broom road , quite elated . doctor long ghost , who saw him thus , ran away with the idea that he was under medical treatment at the time—in the act of taking , what the quacks call , a “ sweat . ”
melville	omoo	a bachelor friend of captain bob rejoiced in the possession of a full european suit ; in which he often stormed the ladies ’ hearts . having a military leaning , he ornamented the coat with a great scarlet patch on the breast ; and mounted it also , here and there , with several regimental buttons , slyly cut from the uniform of a parcel of drunken marines sent ashore on a holiday from a man-of-war . but , in spite of the ornaments , the dress was not exactly the thing . from the tightness of the cloth across the shoulders , his elbows projected from his sides , like an ungainly rider ’ s ; and his ponderous legs were jammed so hard into his slim , nether garments that the threads of every seam showed ; and , at every step , you looked for a catastrophe .
melville	omoo	in general , there seems to be no settled style of dressing among the males ; they wear anything they can get ; in some cases , awkwardly modifying the fashions of their fathers so as to accord with their own altered views of what is becoming .
melville	omoo	but ridiculous as many of them now appear , in foreign habiliments , the tahitians presented a far different appearance in the original national costume ; which was graceful in the extreme , modest to all but the prudish , and peculiarly adapted to the climate . but the short kilts of dyed tappa , the tasselled maroes , and other articles formerly worn , are , at the present day , prohibited by law as indecorous . for what reason necklaces and garlands of flowers , among the women , are also forbidden , i never could learn ; but , it is said , that they were associated , in some way , with a forgotten heathen observance .
melville	omoo	many pleasant , and , seemingly , innocent sports and pastimes , are likewise interdicted . in old times , there were several athletic games practised , such as wrestling , foot-racing , throwing the javelin , and archery . in all these they greatly excelled ; and , for some , splendid festivals were instituted . among their everyday amusements were dancing , tossing the football , kite-flying , flute-playing , and singing traditional ballads ; now , all punishable offences ; though most of them have been so long in disuse that they are nearly forgotten .
melville	omoo	in the same way , the “ opio , ” or festive harvest-home of the breadfruit , has been suppressed ; though , as described to me by captain bob , it seemed wholly free from any immoral tendency . against tattooing , of any kind , there is a severe law .
melville	omoo	that this abolition of their national amusements and customs was not willingly acquiesced in , is shown in the frequent violation of many of the statutes inhibiting them ; and , especially , in the frequency with which their “ hevars , ” or dances , are practised in secret .
melville	omoo	doubtless , in thus denationalizing the tahitians , as it were , the missionaries were prompted by a sincere desire for good ; but the effect has been lamentable . supplied with no amusements in place of those forbidden , the tahitians , who require more recreation than other people , have sunk into a listlessness , or indulge in sensualities , a hundred times more pernicious than all the games ever celebrated in the temple of tanee .
melville	omoo	chapter xlviii . tahiti as it is as in the last few chapters , several matters connected with the general condition of the natives have been incidentally touched upon , it may be well not to leave so important a subject in a state calculated to convey erroneous impressions . let us bestow upon it , therefore , something more than a mere cursory glance .
melville	omoo	but in the first place , let it be distinctly understood that , in all i have to say upon this subject , both here and elsewhere , i mean no harm to the missionaries nor their cause ; i merely desire to set forth things as they actually exist .
melville	omoo	of the results which have flowed from the intercourse of foreigners with the polynesians , including the attempts to civilize and christianize them by the missionaries , tahiti , on many accounts , is obviously the fairest practical example . indeed , it may now be asserted that the experiment of christianizing the tahitians , and improving their social condition by the introduction of foreign customs , has been fully tried . the present generation have grown up under the auspices of their religious instructors . and although it may be urged that the labours of the latter have at times been more or less obstructed by unprincipled foreigners , still , this in no wise renders tahiti any the less a fair illustration ; for , with obstacles like these , the missionaries in polynesia must always , and everywhere struggle .
melville	omoo	nearly sixty years have elapsed since the tahitian mission was started ; and , during this period , it has received the unceasing prayers and contributions of its friends abroad . nor has any enterprise of the kind called forth more devotion on the part of those directly employed in it .
melville	omoo	it matters not that the earlier labourers in the work , although strictly conscientious , were , as a class , ignorant , and , in many cases , deplorably bigoted : such traits have , in some degree , characterized the pioneers of all faiths . and although in zeal and disinterestedness the missionaries now on the island are , perhaps , inferior to their predecessors , they have , nevertheless , in their own way at least , laboured hard to make a christian people of their charge .
melville	omoo	let us now glance at the most obvious changes wrought in their condition . the entire system of idolatry has been done away ; together with several barbarous practices engrafted thereon . but this result is not so much to be ascribed to the missionaries , as to the civilizing effects of a long and constant intercourse with whites of all nations ; to whom , for many years , tahiti has been one of the principal places of resort in the south seas . at the sandwich islands , the potent institution of the taboo , together with the entire paganism of the land , was utterly abolished by a voluntary act of the natives some time previous to the arrival of the first missionaries among them .
melville	omoo	the next most striking change in the tahitians is this . from the permanent residence among them of influential and respectable foreigners , as well as from the frequent visits of ships-of-war , recognizing the nationality of the island , its inhabitants are no longer deemed fit subjects for the atrocities practised upon mere savages ; and hence , secure from retaliation , vessels of all kinds now enter their harbours with perfect safety .
melville	omoo	but let us consider what results are directly ascribable to the missionaries alone . in all cases , they have striven hard to mitigate the evils resulting from the commerce with the whites in general . such attempts , however , have been rather injudicious , and often ineffectual : in truth , a barrier almost insurmountable is presented in the dispositions of the people themselves . still , in this respect , the morality of the islanders is , upon the whole , improved by the presence of the missionaries .
melville	omoo	but the greatest achievement of the latter , and one which in itself is most hopeful and gratifying , is that they have translated the entire bible into the language of the island ; and i have myself known several who were able to read it with facility . they have also established churches , and schools for both children and adults ; the latter , i regret to say , are now much neglected : which must be ascribed , in a great measure , to the disorders growing out of the proceedings of the french .
melville	omoo	it were unnecessary here to enter diffusely into matters connected with the internal government of the tahitian churches and schools . nor , upon this head , is my information copious enough to warrant me in presenting details . but we do not need them . we are merely considering general results , as made apparent in the moral and religious condition of the island at large .
melville	omoo	upon a subject like this , however , it would be altogether too assuming for a single individual to decide ; and so , in place of my own random observations , which may be found elsewhere , i will here present those of several known authors , made under various circumstances , at different periods , and down to a comparative late date . a few very brief extracts will enable the reader to mark for himself what progressive improvement , if any , has taken place .
melville	omoo	nor must it be overlooked that , of these authorities , the two first in order are largely quoted by the right reverend m. kussell , in a work composed for the express purpose of imparting information on the subject of christian missions in polynesia . and he frankly acknowledges , moreover , that they are such as “ can not fail to have great weight with the public . ”
melville	omoo	after alluding to the manifold evils entailed upon the natives by foreigners , and their singularly inert condition ; and after somewhat too severely denouncing the undeniable errors of the mission , kotzebue , the russian navigator , says , “ a religion like this , which forbids every innocent pleasure , and cramps or annihilates every mental power , is a libel on the divine founder of christianity . it is true that the religion of the missionaries has , with a great deal of evil , effected some good . it has restrained the vices of theft and incontinence ; but it has given birth to ignorance , hypocrisy , and a hatred of all other modes of faith , which was once foreign to the open and benevolent character of the tahitian . ”
melville	omoo	captain beechy says that , while at tahiti , he saw scenes “ which must have convinced the great sceptic of the thoroughly immoral condition of the people , and which would force him to conclude , as turnbull did , many years previous , that their intercourse with the europeans had tended to debase , rather than exalt their condition . ”
melville	omoo	about the year 1834 , daniel wheeler , an honest-hearted quaker , prompted by motives of the purest philanthropy , visited , in a vessel of his own , most of the missionary settlements in the south seas . he remained some time at tahiti ; receiving the hospitalities of the missionaries there , and , from time to time , exhorting the natives .
melville	omoo	after bewailing their social condition , he frankly says of their religious state , “ certainly , appearances are unpromising ; and however unwilling to adopt such a conclusion , there is reason to apprehend that christian principle is a great rarity . ”
melville	omoo	such , then , is the testimony of good and unbiassed men , who have been upon the spot ; but , how comes it to differ so widely from impressions of others at home ? simply thus : instead of estimating the result of missionary labours by the number of heathens who have actually been made to understand and practise ( in some measure at least ) the precepts of christianity , this result has been unwarrantably inferred from the number of those who , without any understanding of these things , have in any way been induced to abandon idolatry and conform to certain outward observances .
melville	omoo	by authority of some kind or other , exerted upon the natives through their chiefs , and prompted by the hope of some worldly benefit to the latter , and not by appeals to the reason , have conversions in polynesia been in most cases brought about .
melville	omoo	even in one or two instances—so often held up as wonderful examples of divine power—where the natives have impulsively burned their idols , and rushed to the waters of baptism , the very suddenness of the change has but indicated its unsoundness . williams , the martyr of erromanga , relates an instance where the inhabitants of an island professing christianity voluntarily assembled , and solemnly revived all their heathen customs .
melville	omoo	all the world over , facts are more eloquent than words ; the following will show in what estimation the missionaries themselves hold the present state of christianity and morals among the converted polynesians .
melville	omoo	on the island of imeeo ( attached to the tahitian mission ) is a seminary under the charge of the rev . mr. simpson and wife , for the education of the children of the missionaries , exclusively . sent home—in many cases , at a very early age—to finish their education , the pupils here are taught nothing but the rudiments of knowledge ; nothing more than may be learned in the native schools . notwithstanding this , the two races are kept as far as possible from associating ; the avowed reason being to preserve the young whites from moral contamination . the better to insure this end , every effort is made to prevent them from acquiring the native language .
melville	omoo	they went even further at the sandwich islands ; where , a few years ago , a playground for the children of the missionaries was inclosed with a fence many feet high , the more effectually to exclude the wicked little hawaiians .
melville	omoo	and yet , strange as it may seem , the depravity among the polynesians , which renders precautions like these necessary , was in a measure unknown before their intercourse with the whites . the excellent captain wilson , who took the first missionaries out to tahiti , affirms that the people of that island had , in many things , “ more refined ideas of decency than ourselves. ” vancouver , also , has some noteworthy ideas on this subject , respecting the sandwich islanders .
melville	omoo	that the immorality alluded to is continually increasing is plainly shown in the numerous , severe , and perpetually violated laws against licentiousness of all kinds in both groups of islands . it is hardly to be expected that the missionaries would send home accounts of this state of things . hence , captain beechy , in alluding to the “ polynesian researches ” of ellis , says that the author has impressed his readers with a far more elevated idea of the moral condition of the tahitians , and the degree of civilization to which they have attained , than they deserve ; or , at least , than the facts which came under his observation authorized . he then goes on to say that , in his intercourse with the islanders , “ they had no fear of him , and consequently acted from the impulse of their natural feeling ; so that he was the better enabled to obtain a correct knowledge of their real disposition and habits . ”
melville	omoo	prom my own familiar intercourse with the natives , this last reflection still more forcibly applies to myself . chapter xlix . same subject continued we have glanced at their moral and religious condition ; let us see how it is with them socially , and in other respects .
melville	omoo	it has been said that the only way to civilize a people is to form in them habits of industry . judged by this principle , the tahitians are less civilized now than formerly . true , their constitutional indolence is excessive ; but surely , if the spirit of christianity is among them , so unchristian a vice ought to be , at least , partially remedied . but the reverse is the fact . instead of acquiring new occupations , old ones have been discontinued .
melville	omoo	as previously remarked , the manufacture of tappa is nearly obsolete in many parts of the island . so , too , with that of the native tools and domestic utensils ; very few of which are now fabricated , since the superiority of european wares has been made so evident .
melville	omoo	this , however , would be all very well were the natives to apply themselves to such occupations as would enable them to supply the few articles they need . but they are far from doing so ; and the majority being unable to obtain european substitutes for many things before made by themselves , the inevitable consequence is seen in the present wretched and destitute mode of life among the common people . to me so recently from a primitive valley of the marquesas , the aspect of most of the dwellings of the poorer tahitians , and their general habits , seemed anything but tidy ; nor could i avoid a comparison , immeasurably to the disadvantage of these partially civilized islanders .
melville	omoo	in tahiti , the people have nothing to do ; and idleness , everywhere , is the parent of vice . “ there is scarcely anything , ” says the good old quaker wheeler , “ so striking , or pitiable , as their aimless , nerveless mode of spending life . ”
melville	omoo	attempts have repeatedly been made to rouse them from their sluggishness ; but in vain . several years ago , the cultivation of cotton was introduced ; and , with their usual love of novelty , they went to work with great alacrity ; but the interest excited quickly subsided , and now , not a pound of the article is raised .
melville	omoo	about the same time , machinery for weaving was sent out from london ; and a factory was started at afrehitoo , in imeeo . the whiz of the wheels and spindles brought in volunteers from all quarters , who deemed it a privilege to be admitted to work : yet , in six months , not a boy could be hired ; and the machinery was knocked down , and packed off to sydney .
melville	omoo	it was the same way with the cultivation of the sugar-cane , a plant indigenous to the island ; peculiarly fitted to the soil and climate , and of so excellent a quality that bligh took slips of it to the west indies . all the plantations went on famously for a while ; the natives swarming in the fields like ants , and making a prodigious stir . what few plantations now remain are owned and worked by whites ; who would rather pay a drunken sailor eighteen or twenty spanish dollars a month , than hire a sober native for his “ fish and tarro . ”
melville	omoo	it is well worthy remark here , that every evidence of civilization among the south sea islands directly pertains to foreigners ; though the fact of such evidence existing at all is usually urged as a proof of the elevated condition of the natives . thus , at honolulu , the capital of the sandwich islands , there are fine dwelling-houses , several hotels , and barber-shops , ay , even billiard-rooms ; but all these are owned and used , be it observed , by whites . there are tailors , and blacksmiths , and carpenters also ; but not one of them is a native .
melville	omoo	the fact is , that the mechanical and agricultural employment of civilized life require a kind of exertion altogether too steady and sustained to agree with an indolent people like the polynesians . calculated for a state of nature , in a climate providentially adapted to it , they are unfit for any other . nay , as a race , they can not otherwise long exist .
melville	omoo	the following statement speaks for itself . about the year 1777 , captain cook estimated the population of tahiti at about two hundred thousand . by a regular census , taken some four or five years ago , it was found to be only nine thousand . this amazing decrease not only shows the malignancy of the evils necessary to produce it ; but , from the fact , the inference unavoidably follows that all the wars , child murders , and other depopulating causes , alleged to have existed in former times , were nothing in comparison to them .
melville	omoo	these evils , of course , are solely of foreign origin . to say nothing of the effects of drunkenness , the occasional inroads of the small-pox , and other things which might be mentioned , it is sufficient to allude to a virulent disease which now taints the blood of at least two-thirds of the common people of the island ; and , in some form or other , is transmitted from father to son .
melville	omoo	their first horror and consternation at the earlier ravages of this scourge were pitiable in the extreme . the very name bestowed upon it is a combination of all that is horrid and unmentionable to a civilized being .
melville	omoo	distracted with their sufferings , they brought forth their sick before the missionaries , when they were preaching , and cried out , “ lies , lies ! you tell us of salvation ; and , behold , we are dying . we want no other salvation than to live in this world . where are there any saved through your speech ? pomaree is dead ; and we are all dying with your cursed diseases . when will you give over ? ”
melville	omoo	at present , the virulence of the disorder , in individual cases , has somewhat abated ; but the poison is only the more widely diffused . “ how dreadful and appalling , ” breaks forth old wheeler , “ the consideration that the intercourse of distant nations should have entailed upon these poor , untutored islanders a curse unprecedented , and unheard of , in the annals of history . ”
melville	omoo	in view of these things , who can remain blind to the fact that , so far as mere temporal felicity is concerned , the tahitians are far worse off now , than formerly ; and although their circumstances , upon the whole , are bettered by the presence of the missionaries , the benefits conferred by the latter become utterly insignificant when confronted with the vast preponderance of evil brought about by other means .
melville	omoo	their prospects are hopeless . nor can the most devoted efforts now exempt them from furnishing a marked illustration of a principle which history has always exemplified . years ago brought to a stand , where all that is corrupt in barbarism and civilization unite , to the exclusion of the virtues of either state ; like other uncivilized beings , brought into contact with europeans , they must here remain stationary until utterly extinct .
melville	omoo	the islanders themselves are mournfully watching their doom . several years since , pomaree ii . said to tyreman and bennet , the deputies of the london missionary society , “ you have come to see me at a very bad time . your ancestors came in the time of men , when tahiti was inhabited : you are come to behold just the remnant of my people . ”
melville	omoo	of like import was the prediction of teearmoar , the high-priest of paree ; who lived over a hundred years ago . i have frequently heard it chanted , in a low , sad tone , by aged tahitiana : —
melville	omoo	“ a harree ta fow , a toro ta farraro , a now ta tararta. ” “ the palm-tree shall grow , the coral shall spread , but man shall cease. ” chapter l. something happens to long ghost
melville	omoo	we will now return to the narrative . the day before the julia sailed , dr. johnson paid his last call . he was not quite so bland as usual . all he wanted was the men ’ s names to a paper , certifying to their having received from him sundry medicaments therein mentioned . this voucher , endorsed by captain guy , secured his pay . but he would not have obtained for it the sailors ’ signs manual , had either the doctor or myself been present at the time .
melville	omoo	now , my long friend wasted no love upon johnson ; but , for reasons of his own , hated him heartily : all the same thing in one sense ; for either passion argues an object deserving thereof . and so , to be hated cordially , is only a left-handed compliment ; which shows how foolish it is to be bitter against anyone .
melville	omoo	for my own part , i merely felt a cool , purely incidental , and passive contempt for johnson , as a selfish , mercenary apothecary , and hence , i often remonstrated with long ghost when he flew out against him , and heaped upon him all manner of scurrilous epithets . in his professional brother ’ s presence , however , he never acted thus ; maintaining an amiable exterior , to help along the jokes which were played .
melville	omoo	i am now going to tell another story in which my long friend figures with the physician : i do not wish to bring one or the other of them too often upon the stage ; but as the thing actually happened , i must relate it .
melville	omoo	a few days after johnson presented his bill , as above mentioned , the doctor expressed to me his regret that , although he ( johnson ) had apparently been played off for our entertainment , yet , nevertheless , he had made money out of the transaction . and i wonder , added the doctor , if that now he can not expect to receive any further pay , he could be induced to call again .
melville	omoo	by a curious coincidence , not five minutes after making this observation , doctor long ghost himself fell down in an unaccountable fit ; and without asking anybody ’ s leave , captain bob , who was by , at once dispatched a boy , hot foot , for johnson .
melville	omoo	meanwhile , we carried him into the calabooza ; and the natives , who assembled in numbers , suggested various modes of treatment . one rather energetic practitioner was for holding the patient by the shoulders , while somebody tugged at his feet . this resuscitatory operation was called the “ potata ” ; but thinking our long comrade sufficiently lengthy without additional stretching , we declined potataing him .
melville	omoo	presently the physician was spied coming along the broom road at a great rate , and so absorbed in the business of locomotion , that he heeded not the imprudence of being in a hurry in a tropical climate . he was in a profuse perspiration ; which must have been owing to the warmth of his feelings , notwithstanding we had supposed him a man of no heart . but his benevolent haste upon this occasion was subsequently accounted for : it merely arose from professional curiosity to behold a case most unusual in his polynesian practice . now , under certain circumstances , sailors , generally so frolicsome , are exceedingly particular in having everything conducted with the strictest propriety . accordingly , they deputed me , as his intimate friend , to sit at long ghost ’ s head , so as to be ready to officiate as “ spokesman ” and answer all questions propounded , the rest to keep silent .
melville	omoo	“ what ’ s the matter ? ” exclaimed johnson , out of breath , and bursting into the calabooza : “ how did it happen ? —speak quick ! ” and he looked at long ghost . i told him how the fit came on .
melville	omoo	“ singular ” —he observed— “ very : good enough pulse ; ” and he let go of it , and placed his hand upon the heart . “ but what ’ s all that frothing at the mouth ? ” he continued ; “ and bless me ! look at the abdomen ! ”
melville	omoo	the region thus denominated exhibited the most unaccountable symptoms . a low , rumbling sound was heard ; and a sort of undulation was discernible beneath the thin cotton frock . “ colic , sir ? ” suggested a bystander .
melville	omoo	“ colic be hanged ! ” shouted the physician ; “ who ever heard of anybody in a trance of the colic ? ” during this , the patient lay upon his back , stark and straight , giving no signs of life except those above mentioned .
melville	omoo	“ i ’ ll bleed him ! ” cried johnson at last— “ run for a calabash , one of you ! ” “ life ho ! ” here sung out navy bob , as if he had just spied a sail . “ what under the sun ’ s the matter with him ! ” cried the physician , starting at the appearance of the mouth , which had jerked to one side , and there remained fixed .
melville	omoo	“ pr ’ aps it ’ s st. witus ’ s hornpipe , ” suggested bob . “ hold the calabash ! ” —and the lancet was out in a moment . but before the deed could be done , the face became natural ; —a sigh was heaved ; —the eyelids quivered , opened , closed ; and long ghost , twitching all over , rolled on his side , and breathed audibly . by degrees , he became sufficiently recovered to speak .
melville	omoo	after trying to get something coherent out of him , johnson withdrew ; evidently disappointed in the scientific interest of the case . soon after his departure , the doctor sat up ; and upon being asked what upon earth ailed him , shook his head mysteriously . he then deplored the hardship of being an invalid in such a place , where there was not the slightest provision for his comfort . this awakened the compassion of our good old keeper , who offered to send him to a place where he would be better cared for . long ghost acquiesced ; and being at once mounted upon the shoulders of four of captain bob ’ s men , was marched off in state , like the grand lama of thibet .
melville	omoo	now , i do not pretend to account for his remarkable swoon ; but his reason for suffering himself to be thus removed from the calabooza was strongly suspected to be nothing more than a desire to insure more regularity in his dinner-hour ; hoping that the benevolent native to whom he was going would set a good table .
melville	omoo	the next morning , we were all envying his fortune ; when , of a sudden , he bolted in upon us , looking decidedly out of humour . “ hang it ! ” he cried ; “ i ’ m worse off than ever ; let me have some breakfast ! ” we lowered our slender bag of ship-stores from a rafter , and handed him a biscuit . while this was being munched , he went on and told us his story .
melville	omoo	“ after leaving here , they trotted me back into a valley , and left me in a hut , where an old woman lived by herself . this must be the nurse , thought i ; and so i asked her to kill a pig , and bake it ; for i felt my appetite returning . ‘ ha ! hal—oee mattee—mattee nuee ’ — ( no , no ; you too sick ) . ‘ the devil mattee ye , ’ said i— ‘ give me something to eat ! ’ but nothing could be had . night coming on , i had to stay . creeping into a corner , i tried to sleep ; but it was to no purpose ; —the old crone must have had the quinsy , or something else ; and she kept up such a wheezing and choking that at last i sprang up , and groped after her ; but she hobbled away like a goblin ; and that was the last of her . as soon as the sun rose , i made the best of my way back ; and here i am. ” he never left us more , nor ever had a second fit .
melville	omoo	chapter li . wilson gives us the cut—departure for imeeo about three weeks after the julia ’ s sailing , our conditions began to be a little precarious . we were without any regular supply of food ; the arrival of ships was growing less frequent ; and , what was worse yet , all the natives but good old captain bob began to tire of us . nor was this to be wondered at ; we were obliged to live upon their benevolence , when they had little enough for themselves . besides , we were sometimes driven to acts of marauding ; such as kidnapping pigs , and cooking them in the groves ; at which their proprietors were by no means pleased .
melville	omoo	in this state of affairs , we determined to march off to the consul in a body ; and , as he had brought us to these straits , demand an adequate maintenance . on the point of starting , captain bob ’ s men raised the most outrageous cries , and tried to prevent us . though hitherto we had strolled about wherever we pleased , this grand conjunction of our whole force , upon one particular expedition , seemed to alarm them . but we assured them that we were not going to assault the village ; and so , after a good deal of gibberish , they permitted us to leave .
melville	omoo	we went straight to the pritchard residence , where the consul dwelt . this house—to which i have before referred—is quite commodious . it has a wide verandah , glazed windows , and other appurtenances of a civilized mansion . upon the lawn in front are palm-trees standing erect here and there , like sentinels . the consular office , a small building by itself , is inclosed by the same picket which fences in the lawn .
melville	omoo	we found the office closed ; but , in the verandah of the dwelling-house , was a lady performing a tonsorial operation on the head of a prim-looking , elderly european , in a low , white cravat ; —the most domestic little scene i had witnessed since leaving home . bent upon an interview with wilson , the sailors now deputed the doctor to step forward as a polite inquirer after his health .
melville	omoo	the pair stared very hard as he advanced ; but no ways disconcerted , he saluted them gravely , and inquired for the consul . upon being informed that he had gone down to the beach , we proceeded in that direction ; and soon met a native , who told us that , apprised of our vicinity , wilson was keeping out of the way . we resolved to meet him ; and passing through the village , he suddenly came walking toward us ; having apparently made up his mind that any attempt to elude us would be useless .
melville	omoo	“ what do you want of me , you rascals ? ” he cried—a greeting which provoked a retort in no measured terms . at this juncture , the natives began to crowd round , and several foreigners strolled along . caught in the very act of speaking to such disreputable acquaintances , wilson now fidgeted , and moved rapidly toward his office ; the men following . turning upon them incensed , he bade them be off—he would have nothing more to say to us ; and then , hurriedly addressing captain bob in tahitian , he hastened on , and never stopped till the postern of pritchard ’ s wicket was closed behind him .
melville	omoo	our good old keeper was now highly excited , bustling about in his huge petticoats , and conjuring us to return to the calabooza . after a little debate , we acquiesced . this interview was decisive . sensible that none of the charges brought against us would stand , yet unwilling formally to withdraw them , the consul now wished to get rid of us altogether ; but without being suspected of encouraging our escape . thus only could we account for his conduct .
melville	omoo	some of the party , however , with a devotion to principle truly heroic , swore they would never leave him , happen what might . for my own part , i began to long for a change ; and as there seemed to be no getting away in a ship , i resolved to hit upon some other expedient . but first , i cast about for a comrade ; and of course the long doctor was chosen . we at once laid our heads together ; and for the present , resolved to disclose nothing to the rest .
melville	omoo	a few days previous , i had fallen in with a couple of yankee lads , twins , who , originally deserting their ship at tanning ’ s island ( an uninhabited spot , but exceedingly prolific in fruit of all kinds ) , had , after a long residence there , roved about among the society group . they were last from imeeo—the island immediately adjoining—where they had been in the employ of two foreigners who had recently started a plantation there . these persons , they said , had charged them to send over from papeetee , if they could , two white men for field-labourers .
melville	omoo	now , all but the prospect of digging and delving suited us exactly ; but the opportunity for leaving the island was not to be slighted ; and so we held ourselves in readiness to return with the planters ; who , in a day or two , were expected to visit papeetee in their boat .
melville	omoo	at the interview which ensued , we were introduced to them as peter and paul ; and they agreed to give peter and paul fifteen silver dollars a month , promising something more should we remain with them permanently . what they wanted was men who would stay . to elude the natives—many of whom , not exactly understanding our relations with the consul , might arrest us , were they to see us departing—the coming midnight was appointed for that purpose .
melville	omoo	when the hour drew nigh , we disclosed our intention to the rest . some upbraided us for deserting them ; others applauded , and said that , on the first opportunity , they would follow our example . at last , we bade them farewell . and there would now be a serene sadness in thinking over the scene—since we never saw them again—had not all been dashed by m ’ gee ’ s picking the doctor ’ s pocket of a jack-knife , in the very act of embracing him .
melville	omoo	we stole down to the beach , where , under the shadow of a grove , the boat was waiting . after some delay , we shipped the oars , and pulling outside of the reef , set the sail ; and with a fair wind , glided away for imeeo .
melville	omoo	it was a pleasant trip . the moon was up—the air , warm—the waves , musical—and all above was the tropical night , one purple vault hung round with soft , trembling stars . the channel is some five leagues wide . on one hand , you have the three great peaks of tahiti lording it over ranges of mountains and valleys ; and on the other , the equally romantic elevations of imeeo , high above which a lone peak , called by our companions , “ the marling-pike , ” shot up its verdant spire .
melville	omoo	the planters were quite sociable . they had been sea-faring men , and this , of course , was a bond between us . to strengthen it , a flask of wine was produced , one of several which had been procured in person from the french admiral ’ s steward ; for whom the planters , when on a former visit to papeetee , had done a good turn , by introducing the amorous frenchman to the ladies ashore . besides this , they had a calabash filled with wild boar ’ s meat , baked yams , bread-fruit , and tombez potatoes . pipes and tobacco also were produced ; and while regaling ourselves , plenty of stories were told about the neighbouring islands .
melville	omoo	at last we heard the roar of the imeeo reef ; and gliding through a break , floated over the expanse within , which was smooth as a young girl ’ s brow , and beached the boat .
melville	omoo	chapter lii . the valley of martair we went up through groves to an open space , where we heard voices , and a light was seen glimmering from out a bamboo dwelling . it was the planters ’ retreat ; and in their absence , several girls were keeping house , assisted by an old native , who , wrapped up in tappa , lay in the corner , smoking .
melville	omoo	a hasty meal was prepared , and after it we essayed a nap ; but , alas ! a plague , little anticipated , prevented . unknown in tahiti , the mosquitoes here fairly eddied round us . but more of them anon .
melville	omoo	we were up betimes , and strolled out to view the country . we were in the valley of martair ; shut in , on both sides , by lofty hills . here and there were steep cliffs , gay with flowering shrubs , or hung with pendulous vines , swinging blossoms in the air . of considerable width at the sea , the vale contracts as it runs inland ; terminating , at the distance of several miles , in a range of the most grotesque elevations , which seem embattled with turrets and towers , grown over with verdure , and waving with trees . the valley itself is a wilderness of woodland ; with links of streams flashing through , and narrow pathways fairly tunnelled through masses of foliage .
melville	omoo	all alone , in this wild place , was the abode of the planters ; the only one back from the beach—their sole neighbours , the few fishermen and their families , dwelling in a small grove of cocoa-nut trees whose roots were washed by the sea .
melville	omoo	the cleared tract which they occupied comprised some thirty acres , level as a prairie , part of which was under cultivation ; the whole being fenced in by a stout palisade of trunks and boughs of trees staked firmly in the ground . this was necessary as a defence against the wild cattle and hogs overrunning the island .
melville	omoo	thus far , tombez potatoes were the principal crop raised ; a ready sale for them being obtained among the shipping touching at papeetee . there was a small patch of the taro , or indian turnip , also ; another of yams ; and in one corner , a thrifty growth of the sugar-cane , just ripening .
melville	omoo	on the side of the inclosure next the sea was the house ; newly built of bamboos , in the native style . the furniture consisted of a couple of sea-chests , an old box , a few cooking utensils , and agricultural tools ; together with three fowling-pieces , hanging from a rafter ; and two enormous hammocks swinging in opposite corners , and composed of dried bullocks ’ hides , stretched out with poles .
melville	omoo	the whole plantation was shut in by a dense forest ; and , close by the house , a dwarfed “ aoa , ” or species of banian-tree , had purposely been left twisting over the palisade , in the most grotesque manner , and thus made a pleasant shade . the branches of this curious tree afforded low perches , upon which the natives frequently squatted , after the fashion of their race , and smoked and gossiped by the hour .
melville	omoo	we had a good breakfast of fish—speared by the natives , before sunrise , on the reef—pudding of indian turnip , fried bananas , and roasted bread-fruit . during the repast , our new friends were quite sociable and communicative . it seems that , like nearly all uneducated foreigners , residing in polynesia , they had , some time previous , deserted from a ship ; and , having heard a good deal about the money to be made by raising supplies for whaling-vessels , they determined upon embarking in the business . strolling about , with this intention , they , at last , came to martair ; and , thinking the soil would suit , set themselves to work . they began by finding out the owner of the particular spot coveted , and then making a “ tayo ” of him .
melville	omoo	he turned out to be tonoi , the chief of the fishermen : who , one day , when exhilarated with brandy , tore his meagre tappa from his loins , and gave me to know that he was allied by blood with pomaree herself ; and that his mother came from the illustrious race of pontiffs , who , in old times , swayed their bamboo crosier over all the pagans of imeeo . a regal , and right reverend lineage ! but , at the time i speak of , the dusky noble was in decayed circumstances , and , therefore , by no means unwilling to alienate a few useless acres . as an equivalent , he received from the strangers two or three rheumatic old muskets , several red woollen shirts , and a promise to be provided for in his old age : he was always to find a home with the planters .
melville	omoo	desirous of living on the cosy footing of a father-in-law , he frankly offered his two daughters for wives ; but as such , they were politely declined ; the adventurers , though not averse to courting , being unwilling to entangle themselves in a matrimonial alliance , however splendid in point of family .
melville	omoo	tonoi ’ s men , the fishermen of the grove , were a sad set . secluded , in a great measure , from the ministrations of the missionaries , they gave themselves up to all manner of lazy wickedness . strolling among the trees of a morning , you came upon them napping on the shady side of a canoe hauled up among the bushes ; lying on a tree smoking ; or , more frequently still , gambling with pebbles ; though , a little tobacco excepted , what they gambled for at their outlandish games , it would be hard to tell . other idle diversions they had also , in which they seemed to take great delight . as for fishing , it employed but a small part of their time . upon the whole , they were a merry , indigent , godless race .
melville	omoo	tonoi , the old sinner , leaning against the fallen trunk of a cocoa-nut tree , invariably squandered his mornings at pebbles ; a gray-headed rook of a native regularly plucking him of every other stick of tobacco obtained from his friends , the planters . toward afternoon , he strolled back to their abode ; where he tarried till the next morning , smoking and snoozing , and , at times , prating about the hapless fortunes of the house of tonoi . but like any other easy-going old dotard , he seemed for the most part perfectly content with cheerful board and lodging .
melville	omoo	on the whole , the valley of martair was the quietest place imaginable . could the mosquitoes be induced to emigrate , one might spend the month of august there quite pleasantly . but this was not the case with the luckless long ghost and myself ; as will presently be seen .
melville	omoo	chapter liii . farming in polynesia the planters were both whole-souled fellows ; but , in other respects , as unlike as possible . one was a tall , robust yankee , born in the backwoods of maine , sallow , and with a long face ; —the other was a short little cockney , who had first clapped his eyes on the monument .
melville	omoo	the voice of zeke , the yankee , had a twang like a cracked viol ; and shorty ( as his comrade called him ) , clipped the aspirate from every word beginning with one . the latter , though not the tallest man in the world , was a good-looking young fellow of twenty-five . his cheeks were dyed with the fine saxon red , burned deeper from his roving life : his blue eye opened well , and a profusion of fair hair curled over a well-shaped head .
melville	omoo	but zeke was no beauty . a strong , ugly man , he was well adapted for manual labour ; and that was all . his eyes were made to see with , and not for ogling . compared with the cockney , he was grave , and rather taciturn ; but there was a deal of good old humour bottled up in him , after all . for the rest , he was frank , good-hearted , shrewd , and resolute ; and like shorty , quite illiterate .
melville	omoo	though a curious conjunction , the pair got along together famously . but , as no two men were ever united in any enterprise without one getting the upper hand of the other , so in most matters zeke had his own way . shorty , too , had imbibed from him a spirit of invincible industry ; and heaven only knows what ideas of making a fortune on their plantation .
melville	omoo	we were much concerned at this ; for the prospect of their setting us , in their own persons , an example of downright hard labour , was anything but agreeable . but it was now too late to repent what we had done .
melville	omoo	the first day—thank fortune—we did nothing . having treated us as guests thus far , they no doubt thought it would be wanting in delicacy to set us to work before the compliments of the occasion were well over . the next morning , however , they both looked business-like , and we were put to .
melville	omoo	“ wall , b ’ ys ” ( boys ) , said zeke , knocking the ashes out of his pipe , after breakfast— “ we must get at it . shorty , give peter there ( the doctor ) , the big hoe , and paul the other , and let ’ s be off. ” going to a corner , shorty brought forth three of the implements ; and distributing them impartially , trudged on after his partner , who took the lead with something in the shape of an axe .
melville	omoo	for a moment left alone in the house , we looked at each other , quaking . we were each equipped with a great , clumsy piece of a tree , armed at one end with a heavy , flat mass of iron .
melville	omoo	the cutlery part—especially adapted to a primitive soil—was an importation from sydney ; the handles must have been of domestic manufacture . “ hoes ” —so called—we had heard of , and seen ; but they were harmless in comparison with the tools in our hands .
melville	omoo	“ what ’ s to be done with them ? ” inquired i of peter . “ lift them up and down , ” he replied ; “ or put them in motion some way or other . paul , we are in a scrape—but hark ! they are calling ; ” and shouldering the hoes , off we marched .
melville	omoo	our destination was the farther side of the plantation , where the ground , cleared in part , had not yet been broken up ; but they were now setting about it . upon halting , i asked why a plough was not used ; some of the young wild steers might be caught and trained for draught .
melville	omoo	zeke replied that , for such a purpose , no cattle , to his knowledge , had ever been used in any part of polynesia . as for the soil of martair , so obstructed was it with roots , crossing and recrossing each other at all points , that no kind of a plough could be used to advantage . the heavy sydney hoes were the only thing for such land .
melville	omoo	our work was now before us ; but , previous to commencing operations , i endeavoured to engage the yankee in a little further friendly chat concerning the nature of virgin soils in general , and that of the valley of martair in particular . so masterly a stratagem made long ghost brighten up ; and he stood by ready to join in . but what our friend had to say about agriculture all referred to the particular part of his plantation upon which we stood ; and having communicated enough on this head to enable us to set to work to the best advantage , he fell to , himself ; and shorty , who had been looking on , followed suit .
melville	omoo	the surface , here and there , presented closely amputated branches of what had once been a dense thicket . they seemed purposely left projecting , as if to furnish a handle whereby to drag out the roots beneath . after loosening the hard soil , by dint of much thumping and pounding , the yankee jerked one of the roots this way and that , twisting it round and round , and then tugging at it horizontally .
melville	omoo	“ come ! lend us a hand ! ” he cried , at last ; and running up , we all four strained away in concert . the tough obstacle convulsed the surface with throes and spasms ; but stuck fast , notwithstanding .
melville	omoo	“ dumn it ! ” cried zeke , “ we ’ ll have to get a rope ; run to the house , shorty , and fetch one. ” the end of this being attached , we took plenty of room , and strained away once more .
melville	omoo	“ give us a song , shorty , ” said the doctor ; who was rather sociable , on a short acquaintance . where the work to be accomplished is any way difficult , this mode of enlivening toil is quite efficacious among sailors . so willing to make everything as cheerful as possible , shorty struck up , “ were you ever in dumbarton ? ” a marvellously inspiring , but somewhat indecorous windlass chorus .
melville	omoo	at last , the yankee cast a damper on his enthusiasm by exclaiming , in a pet , “ oh ! dumn your singing ! keep quiet , and pull away ! ” this we now did , in the most uninteresting silence ; until , with a jerk that made every elbow hum , the root dragged out ; and most inelegantly , we all landed upon the ground . the doctor , quite exhausted , stayed there ; and , deluded into believing that , after so doughty a performance , we would be allowed a cessation of toil , took off his hat , and fanned himself .
melville	omoo	“ rayther a hard customer , that , peter , ” observed the yankee , going up to him : “ but it ’ s no use for any on ’ em to hang back ; for i ’ m dumned if they hain ’ t got to come out , whether or no . hurrah ! let ’ s get at it agin ! ”
melville	omoo	“ mercy ! ” ejaculated the doctor , rising slowly , and turning round . “ he ’ ll be the death of us ! ” falling to with our hoes again , we worked singly , or together , as occasion required , until “ nooning time ” came .
melville	omoo	the period , so called by the planters , embraced about three hours in the middle of the day ; during which it was so excessively hot , in this still , brooding valley , shut out from the trades , and only open toward the leeward side of the island , that labour in the sun was out of the question . to use a hyperbolical phrase of shorty ’ s , “ it was ’ ot enough to melt the nose h ’ off a brass monkey . ”
melville	omoo	returning to the house , shorty , assisted by old tonoi , cooked the dinner ; and , after we had all partaken thereof , both the cockney and zeke threw themselves into one of the hammocks , inviting us to occupy the other . thinking it no bad idea , we did so ; and , after skirmishing with the mosquitoes , managed to fall into a doze . as for the planters , more accustomed to “ nooning , ” they , at once , presented a nuptial back to each other ; and were soon snoring away at a great rate . tonoi snoozed on a mat , in one corner .
melville	omoo	at last , we were roused by zeke ’ s crying out , “ up b ’ ys ; up ! rise , and shine ; time to get at it agin ! ” looking at the doctor , i perceived , very plainly , that he had decided upon something .
melville	omoo	in a languid voice , he told zeke that he was not very well : indeed , that he had not been himself for some time past ; though a little rest , no doubt , would recruit him . the yankee thinking , from this , that our valuable services might be lost to him altogether , were he too hard upon us at the outset , at once begged us both to consult our own feelings , and not exert ourselves for the present , unless we felt like it . then—without recognizing the fact that my comrade claimed to be actually unwell—he simply suggested that , since he was so tired , he had better , perhaps , swing in his hammock for the rest of the day . if agreeable , however , i myself might accompany him upon a little bullock-hunting excursion in the neighbouring hills . in this proposition , i gladly acquiesced ; though peter , who was a great sportsman , put on a long face . the muskets and ammunition were forthwith got from overhead ; and , everything being then ready , zeke cried out , “ tonoi ! come ; aramai ! ( get up ) we want you for pilot . shorty , my lad , look arter things , you know ; and if you likes , why , there ’ s them roots in the field yonder . ”
melville	omoo	having thus arranged his domestic affairs to please himself , though little to shorty ’ s satisfaction , i thought , he slung his powder-horn over his shoulder , and we started . tonoi was , at once , sent on in advance ; and leaving the plantation , he struck into a path which led toward the mountains .
melville	omoo	after hurrying through the thickets for some time , we came out into the sunlight , in an open glade , just under the shadow of the hills . here , zeke pointed aloft to a beetling crag far distant , where a bullock , with horns thrown back , stood like a statue .
melville	omoo	chapter liv . some account of the wild cattle in polynesia before we proceed further , a word or two concerning these wild cattle , and the way they came on the island .
melville	omoo	some fifty years ago , vancouver left several bullocks , sheep and goats , at various places in the society group . he instructed the natives to look after the animals carefully ; and by no means to slaughter any until a considerable stock had accumulated .
melville	omoo	the sheep must have died off : for i never saw a solitary fleece in any part of polynesia . the pair left were an ill-assorted couple , perhaps ; separated in disgust , and died without issue .
melville	omoo	as for the goats , occasionally you come across a black , misanthropic ram , nibbling the scant herbage of some height inaccessible to man , in preference to the sweet grasses of the valley below . the goats are not very numerous .
melville	omoo	the bullocks , coming of a prolific ancestry , are a hearty set , racing over the island of imeeo in considerable numbers , though in tahiti but few of them are seen . at the former place , the original pair must have scampered off to the interior since it is now so thickly populated by their wild progeny . the herds are the private property of queen pomaree ; from whom the planters had obtained permission to shoot for their own use as many as they pleased .
melville	omoo	the natives stand in great awe of these cattle ; and for this reason are excessively timid in crossing the island , preferring rather to sail round to an opposite village in their canoes .
melville	omoo	tonoi abounded in bullock stories ; most of which , by the bye , had a spice of the marvellous . the following is one of these . once upon a time , he was going over the hills with a brother—now no more—when a great bull came bellowing out of a wood , and both took to their heels . the old chief sprang into a tree ; his companion , flying in an opposite direction , was pursued , and , in the very act of reaching up to a bough , trampled underfoot . the unhappy man was then gored—tossed in the air—and finally run away with on the bull ’ s horns . more dead than alive , tonoi waited till all was over , and then made the best of his way home . the neighbours , armed with two or three muskets , at once started to recover , if possible , his unfortunate brother ’ s remains . at nightfall , they returned without discovering any trace of him ; but the next morning , tonoi himself caught a glimpse of the bullock , marching across the mountain ’ s brow , with a long dark object borne aloft on his horns .
melville	omoo	having referred to vancouver ’ s attempts to colonize the islands with useful quadrupeds , we may as well say something concerning his success upon hawaii , one of the largest islands in the whole polynesian archipelago ; and which gives the native name to the well-known cluster named by cook in honour of lord sandwich .
melville	omoo	hawaii is some one hundred leagues in circuit , and covers an area of over four thousand miles . until within a few years past , its interior was almost unknown , even to the inhabitants themselves , who , for ages , had been prevented from wandering thither by certain strange superstitions . pelee , the terrific goddess of the volcanoes mount eoa and mount kea , was supposed to guard all the passes to the extensive valleys lying round their base . there are legends of her having chased with streams of fire several impious adventurers . near hilo , a jet-black cliff is shown , with the vitreous torrent apparently pouring over into the sea : just as it cooled after one of these supernatural eruptions .
melville	omoo	to these inland valleys , and the adjoining hillsides , which are clothed in the most luxuriant vegetation , vancouver ’ s bullocks soon wandered ; and unmolested for a long period , multiplied in vast herds .
melville	omoo	some twelve or fifteen years ago , the natives lost sight of their superstitions , and learning the value of the hides in commerce , began hunting the creatures that wore them ; but being very fearful and awkward in a business so novel , their success was small ; and it was not until the arrival of a party of spanish hunters , men regularly trained to their calling upon the plains of california , that the work of slaughter was fairly begun .
melville	omoo	the spaniards were showy fellows , tricked out in gay blankets , leggings worked with porcupine quills , and jingling spurs . mounted upon trained indian mares , these heroes pursued their prey up to the very base of the burning mountains ; making the profoundest solitudes ring with their shouts , and flinging the lasso under the very nose of the vixen goddess pelee . hilo , a village upon the coast , was their place of resort ; and thither flocked roving whites from all the islands of the group . as pupils of the dashing spaniards , many of these dissipated fellows , quaffing too freely of the stirrup-cup , and riding headlong after the herds , when they reeled in the saddle , were unhorsed and killed .
melville	omoo	this was about the year 1835 , when the present king , tammahamaha iii. , was a lad . with royal impudence laying claim to the sole property of the cattle , he was delighted with the idea of receiving one of every two silver dollars paid down for their hides ; so , with no thought for the future , the work of extermination went madly on . in three years ’ time , eighteen thousand bullocks were slain , almost entirely upon the single island of hawaii .
melville	omoo	the herds being thus nearly destroyed , the sagacious young prince imposed a rigorous “ taboo ” upon the few surviving cattle , which was to remain in force for ten years . during this period—not yet expired—all hunting is forbidden , unless directly authorized by the king .
melville	omoo	the massacre of the cattle extended to the hapless goats . in one year , three thousand of their skins were sold to the merchants of honolulu , fetching a quartila , or a shilling sterling apiece .
melville	omoo	after this digression , it is time to run on after tonoi and the yankee . chapter lv . a hunting ramble with zeke at the foot of the mountain , a steep path went up among rocks and clefts mantled with verdure . here and there were green gulfs , down which it made one giddy to peep . at last we gained an overhanging , wooded shelf of land which crowned the heights ; and along this , the path , well shaded , ran like a gallery .
melville	omoo	in every direction the scenery was enchanting . there was a low , rustling breeze ; and below , in the vale , the leaves were quivering ; the sea lay , blue and serene , in the distance ; and inland the surface swelled up , ridge after ridge , and peak upon peak , all bathed in the indian haze of the tropics , and dreamy to look upon . still valleys , leagues away , reposed in the deep shadows of the mountains ; and here and there , waterfalls lifted up their voices in the solitude . high above all , and central , the “ marling-spike ” lifted its finger . upon the hillsides , small groups of bullocks were seen ; some quietly browsing ; others slowly winding into the valleys .
melville	omoo	we went on , directing our course for a slope of these hills , a mile or two further , where the nearest bullocks were seen . we were cautious in keeping to the windward of them ; their sense of smell and hearing being , like those of all wild creatures , exceedingly acute .
melville	omoo	as there was no knowing that we might not surprise some other kind of game in the coverts through which we were passing , we crept along warily . the wild hogs of the island are uncommonly fierce ; and as they often attack the natives , i could not help following tonoi ’ s example of once in a while peeping in under the foliage . frequent retrospective glances also served to assure me that our retreat was not cut off .
melville	omoo	as we rounded a clump of bushes , a noise behind them , like the crackling of dry branches , broke the stillness . in an instant , tonoi ’ s hand was on a bough , ready for a spring , and zeke ’ s finger touched the trigger of his piece . again the stillness was broken ; and thinking it high time to get ready , i brought my musket to my shoulder .
melville	omoo	“ look sharp ! ” cried the yankee ; and dropping on one knee , he brushed the twigs aside . presently , off went his piece ; and with a wild snort , a black , bristling boar—his cherry red lip curled up by two glittering tusks—dashed , unharmed , across the path , and crashed through the opposite thicket . i saluted him with a charge as he disappeared ; but not the slightest notice was taken of the civility .
melville	omoo	by this time , tonoi , the illustrious descendant of the bishops of imeeo , was twenty feet from the ground . “ aramai ! come down , you old fool ! ” cried the yankee ; “ the pesky critter ’ s on t ’ other side of the island afore this . ”
melville	omoo	“ i rayther guess , ” he continued , as we began reloading , “ that we ’ ve spoiled sport by firing at that ’ ere tarnal hog . them bullocks heard the racket , and are flinging their tails about now on the keen jump . quick , paul , and let ’ s climb that rock yonder , and see if so be there ’ s any in sight . ”
melville	omoo	but none were to be seen , except at such a distance that they looked like ants . as evening was now at hand , my companion proposed our returning home forthwith ; and then , after a sound night ’ s rest , starting in the morning upon a good day ’ s hunt with the whole force of the plantation .
melville	omoo	following another pass in descending into the valley , we passed through some nobly wooded land on the face of the mountain . one variety of tree particularly attracted my attention . the dark mossy stem , over seventy feet high , was perfectly branchless for many feet above the ground , when it shot out in broad boughs laden with lustrous leaves of the deepest green . and all round the lower part of the trunk , thin , slab-like buttresses of bark , perfectly smooth , and radiating from a common centre , projected along the ground for at least two yards . from below , these natural props tapered upward until gradually blended with the trunk itself . there were signs of the wild cattle having sheltered themselves behind them . zeke called this the canoe tree ; as in old times it supplied the navies of the kings of tahiti . for canoe building , the woods is still used . being extremely dense , and impervious to worms , it is very durable .
melville	omoo	emerging from the forest , when half-way down the hillside , we came upon an open space , covered with ferns and grass , over which a few lonely trees were casting long shadows in the setting sun . here , a piece of ground some hundred feet square , covered with weeds and brambles , and sounding hollow to the tread , was inclosed by a ruinous wall of stones . tonoi said it was an almost forgotten burial-place , of great antiquity , where no one had been interred since the islanders had been christians . sealed up in dry , deep vaults , many a dead heathen was lying here .
melville	omoo	curious to prove the old man ’ s statement , i was anxious to get a peep at the catacombs ; but hermetically overgrown with vegetation as they were , no aperture was visible . before gaining the level of the valley , we passed by the site of a village , near a watercourse , long since deserted . there was nothing but stone walls , and rude dismantled foundations of houses , constructed of the same material . large trees and brushwood were growing rankly among them .
melville	omoo	i asked tonoi how long it was since anyone had lived here . “ me , tammaree ( boy ) —plenty kannaker ( men ) martair , ” he replied . “ now , only poor pehe kannaka ( fishermen ) left—me born here. ” going down the valley , vegetation of every kind presented a different aspect from that of the high land .
melville	omoo	chief among the trees of the plain on this island is the “ ati , ” large and lofty , with a massive trunk , and broad , laurel-shaped leaves . the wood is splendid . in tahiti , i was shown a narrow , polished plank fit to make a cabinet for a king . taken from the heart of the tree , it was of a deep , rich scarlet , traced with yellow veins , and in some places clouded with hazel .
melville	omoo	in the same grove with the regal “ ah ” you may see the beautiful flowering “ hotoo ” ; its pyramid of shining leaves diversified with numberless small , white blossoms . planted with trees as the valley is almost throughout its entire length , i was astonished to observe so very few which were useful to the natives : not one in a hundred was a cocoa-nut or bread-fruit tree .
melville	omoo	but here tonoi again enlightened me . in the sanguinary religious hostilities which ensued upon the conversion of christianity of the first pomaree , a war-party from tahiti destroyed ( by “ girdling ” the bark ) entire groves of these invaluable trees . for some time afterwards they stood stark and leafless in the sun ; sad monuments of the fate which befell the inhabitants of the valley .
melville	omoo	chapter lvi . mosquitoes the night following the hunting trip , long ghost and myself , after a valiant defence , had to fly the house on account of the mosquitoes . and here i can not avoid relating a story , rife among the natives , concerning the manner in which these insects were introduced upon the island .
melville	omoo	some years previous , a whaling captain , touching at an adjoining bay , got into difficulty with its inhabitants , and at last carried his complaint before one of the native tribunals ; but receiving no satisfaction , and deeming himself aggrieved , he resolved upon taking signal revenge . one night , he towed a rotten old water-cask ashore , and left it in a neglected taro patch where the ground was warm and moist . hence the mosquitoes .
melville	omoo	i tried my best to learn the name of this man ; and hereby do what i can to hand it down to posterity . it was coleman—nathan cole-man . the ship belonged to nantucket .
melville	omoo	when tormented by the mosquitoes , i found much relief in coupling the word “ coleman ” with another of one syllable , and pronouncing them together energetically . the doctor suggested a walk to the beach , where there was a long , low shed tumbling to pieces , but open lengthwise to a current of air which he thought might keep off the mosquitoes . so thither we went .
melville	omoo	the ruin partially sheltered a relic of times gone by , which , a few days after , we examined with much curiosity . it was an old war-canoe , crumbling to dust . being supported by the same rude blocks upon which , apparently , it had years before been hollowed out , in all probability it had never been afloat .
melville	omoo	outside , it seemed originally stained of a green colour , which , here and there , was now changed into a dingy purple . the prow terminated in a high , blunt beak ; both sides were covered with carving ; and upon the stern , was something which long ghost maintained to be the arms of the royal house of pomaree . the device had an heraldic look , certainly—being two sharks with the talons of hawks clawing a knot left projecting from the wood .
melville	omoo	the canoe was at least forty feet long , about two wide , and four deep . the upper part—consisting of narrow planks laced together with cords of sinnate—had in many places fallen off , and lay decaying upon the ground . still , there were ample accommodations left for sleeping ; and in we sprang—the doctor into the bow , and i into the stern . i soon fell asleep ; but waking suddenly , cramped in every joint from my constrained posture , i thought , for an instant , that i must have been prematurely screwed down in my coffin .
melville	omoo	presenting my compliments to long ghost , i asked how it fared with him . “ bad enough , ” he replied , as he tossed about in the outlandish rubbish lying in the bottom of our couch . “ pah ! how these old mats smell ! ”
melville	omoo	as he continued talking in this exciting strain for some time , i at last made no reply , having resumed certain mathematical reveries to induce repose . but finding the multiplication table of no avail , i summoned up a grayish image of chaos in a sort of sliding fluidity , and was just falling into a nap on the strength of it , when i heard a solitary and distinct buzz . the hour of my calamity was at hand . one blended hum , the creature darted into the canoe like a small swordfish ; and i out of it .
melville	omoo	upon getting into the open air , to my surprise , there was long ghost , fanning himself wildly with an old paddle . he had just made a noiseless escape from a swarm which had attacked his own end of the canoe .
melville	omoo	it was now proposed to try the water ; so a small fishing canoe , hauled up near by , was quickly launched ; and paddling a good distance off , we dropped overboard the native contrivance for an anchor—a heavy stone , attached to a cable of braided bark . at this part of the island the encircling reef was close to the shore , leaving the water within smooth , and extremely shallow .
melville	omoo	it was a blessed thought ! we knew nothing till sunrise , when the motion of our aquatic cot awakened us . i looked up , and beheld zeke wading toward the shore , and towing us after him by the bark cable . pointing to the reef , he told us we had had a narrow escape .
melville	omoo	it was true enough ; the water-sprites had rolled our stone out of its noose , and we had floated away . chapter lvii . the second hunt in the mountains fair dawned , over the hills of martair , the jocund morning of our hunt .
melville	omoo	everything had been prepared for it overnight ; and , when we arrived at the house , a good breakfast was spread by shorty : and old tonoi was bustling about like an innkeeper . several of his men , also , were in attendance to accompany us with calabashes of food ; and , in case we met with any success , to officiate as bearers of burdens on our return .
melville	omoo	apprised , the evening previous , of the meditated sport , the doctor had announced his willingness to take part therein . now , subsequent events made us regard this expedition as a shrewd device of the yankee ’ s . once get us off on a pleasure trip , and with what face could we afterward refuse to work ? beside , he enjoyed all the credit of giving us a holiday . nor did he omit assuring us that , work or play , our wages were all the while running on .
melville	omoo	a dilapidated old musket of tonoi ’ s was borrowed for the doctor . it was exceedingly short and heavy , with a clumsy lock , which required a strong finger to pull the trigger . on trying the piece by firing at a mark , long ghost was satisfied that it could not fail of doing execution : the charge went one way , and he the other .
melville	omoo	upon this , he endeavoured to negotiate an exchange of muskets with shorty ; but the cockney was proof against his blandishments ; at last , he intrusted his weapon to one of the natives to carry for him .
melville	omoo	marshalling our forces , we started for the head of the valley ; near which a path ascended to a range of high land , said to be a favourite resort of the cattle .
melville	omoo	shortly after gaining the heights , a small herd , some way off , was perceived entering a wood . we hurried on ; and , dividing our party , went in after them at four different points ; each white man followed by several natives .
melville	omoo	i soon found myself in a dense covert ; and , after looking round , was just emerging into a clear space , when i heard a report , and a bullet knocked the bark from a tree near by . the same instant there was a trampling and crashing ; and five bullocks , nearly abreast , broke into view across the opening , and plunged right toward the spot where myself and three of the islanders were standing .
melville	omoo	they were small , black , vicious-looking creatures ; with short , sharp horns , red nostrils , and eyes like coals of fire . on they came—their dark woolly heads hanging down . by this time my island backers were roosting among the trees . glancing round , for an instant , to discover a retreat in case of emergency , i raised my piece , when a voice cried out , from the wood , “ right between the ’ orns , paul ! right between the ’ orns ! ” down went my barrel in range with a small white tuft on the forehead of the headmost one ; and , letting him have it , i darted to one side . as i turned again , the five bullocks shot by like a blast , making the air eddy in their wake .
melville	omoo	the yankee now burst into view , and saluted them in flank . whereupon , the fierce little bull with the tufted forehead flirted his long tail over his buttocks ; kicked out with his hind feet , and shot forward a full length . it was nothing but a graze ; and , in an instant , they were out of sight , the thicket into which they broke rocking overhead , and marking their progress .
melville	omoo	the action over , the heavy artillery came up , in the person of the long doctor with the blunderbuss . “ where are they ? ” he cried , out of breath . “ a mile or two h ’ off , by this time , ” replied the cockney . “ lord , paul i you ought to ’ ve sent an ’ ailstone into that little black ’ un . ”
melville	omoo	while excusing my want of skill , as well as i could , zeke , rushing forward , suddenly exclaimed , “ creation ! what are you ’ bout there , peter ? ” peter , incensed at our ill luck , and ignorantly imputing it to the cowardice of our native auxiliaries , was bringing his piece to bear upon his trembling squire—the musket-carrier—now descending a tree .
melville	omoo	pulling trigger , the bullet went high over his head ; and , hopping to the ground , bellowing like a calf , the fellow ran away as fast as his heels could carry him . the rest followed us , after this , with fear and trembling .
melville	omoo	after forming our line of march anew , we went on for several hours without catching a glimpse of the game ; the reports of the muskets having been heard at a great distance . at last , we mounted a craggy height , to obtain a wide view of the country . prom this place , we beheld three cattle quietly browsing in a green opening of a wood below ; the trees shutting them in all round .
melville	omoo	a general re-examination of the muskets now took place , followed by a hasty lunch from the calabashes : we then started . as we descended the mountainside the cattle were in plain sight until we entered the forest , when we lost sight of them for a moment ; but only to see them again , as we crept close up to the spot where they grazed .
melville	omoo	they were a bull , a cow , and a calf . the cow was lying down in the shade , by the edge of the wood ; the calf , sprawling out before her in the grass , licking her lips ; while old taurus himself stood close by , casting a paternal glance at this domestic little scene , and conjugally elevating his nose in the air .
melville	omoo	“ now then , ” said zeke , in a whisper , “ let ’ s take the poor creeturs while they are huddled together . crawl along , b ’ ys ; crawl along . fire together , mind ; and not till i say the word . ”
melville	omoo	we crept up to the very edge of the open ground , and knelt behind a clump of bushes ; resting our levelled barrels among the branches . the slight rustling was heard . taurus turned round , dropped his head to the ground , and sent forth a low , sullen bellow ; then snuffed the air . the cow rose on her foreknees , pitched forward alarmedly , and stood upon her legs ; while the calf , with ears pricked , got right underneath her . all three were now grouped , and in an instant would be off .
melville	omoo	“ i take the bull , ” cried our leader ; “ fire ! ” the calf fell like a clod ; its dam uttered a cry , and thrust her head into the thicket ; but she turned , and came moaning up to the lifeless calf , going round and round it , snuffing fiercely with her bleeding nostrils . a crashing in the wood , and a loud roar , announced the flying bull .
melville	omoo	soon , another shot was fired , and the cow fell . leaving some of the natives to look after the dead cattle , the rest of us hurried on after the bull ; his dreadful bellowing guiding us to the spot where he lay . wounded in the shoulder , in his fright and agony he had bounded into the wood ; but when we came up to him , he had sunk to the earth in a green hollow , thrusting his black muzzle into a pool of his own blood , and tossing it over his hide in clots .
melville	omoo	the yankee brought his piece to a rest ; and , the next instant , the wild brute sprang into the air , and with his forelegs crouching under him , fell dead . our island friends were now in high spirits ; all courage and alacrity . old tonoi thought nothing of taking poor taurus himself by the horns , and peering into his glazed eyes .
melville	omoo	our ship knives were at once in request ; and , skinning the cattle , we hung them high up by cords of bark from the boughs of a tree . withdrawing into a covert , we there waited for the wild hogs ; which , according to zeke , would soon make their appearance , lured by the smell of blood . presently we heard them coming , in two or three different directions ; and , in a moment , they were tearing the offal to pieces .
melville	omoo	as only one shot at these creatures could be relied on , we intended firing simultaneously ; but , somehow or other , the doctor ’ s piece went off by itself , and one of the hogs dropped . the others then breaking into the thicket , the rest of us sprang after them ; resolved to have another shot at all hazards .
shakespeare	romeo	mercutio . and but one word with one of us ? couple it with something ; make it a word and a blow . tybalt . you shall find me apt enough to that , sir , and you will give me occasion .
shakespeare	romeo	mercutio . could you not take some occasion without giving ? tybalt . mercutio , thou consortest with romeo . mercutio . consort ? what , dost thou make us minstrels ? and thou make minstrels of us , look to hear nothing but discords . here ’ s my fiddlestick , here ’ s that shall make you dance . zounds , consort !

shakespeare	romeo	mercutio . but i ’ ll be hanged , sir , if he wear your livery . marry , go before to field , he ’ ll be your follower ; your worship in that sense may call him man . tybalt . romeo , the love i bear thee can afford no better term than this : thou art a villain .
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . tybalt , the reason that i have to love thee doth much excuse the appertaining rage to such a greeting . villain am i none ; therefore farewell ; i see thou know ’ st me not .
shakespeare	romeo	tybalt . boy , this shall not excuse the injuries that thou hast done me , therefore turn and draw . romeo . i do protest i never injur ’ d thee , but love thee better than thou canst devise till thou shalt know the reason of my love . and so good capulet , which name i tender as dearly as mine own , be satisfied .

shakespeare	romeo	lady capulet . he is a kinsman to the montague . affection makes him false , he speaks not true . some twenty of them fought in this black strife , and all those twenty could but kill one life . i beg for justice , which thou , prince , must give ; romeo slew tybalt , romeo must not live .
shakespeare	romeo	prince . romeo slew him , he slew mercutio . who now the price of his dear blood doth owe ? montague . not romeo , prince , he was mercutio ’ s friend ; his fault concludes but what the law should end , the life of tybalt .

shakespeare	othello	desdemona . it yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow . othello . this argues fruitfulness and liberal heart . hot , hot , and moist . this hand of yours requires a sequester from liberty , fasting and prayer , much castigation , exercise devout ; for here ’ s a young and sweating devil here that commonly rebels . ’ tis a good hand , a frank one .
shakespeare	othello	desdemona . you may indeed say so , for ’ twas that hand that gave away my heart . othello . a liberal hand . the hearts of old gave hands , but our new heraldry is hands , not hearts .

shakespeare	othello	desdemona . here , my lord . othello . that which i gave you . desdemona . i have it not about me . othello . not ? desdemona . no , faith , my lord . othello . that is a fault . that handkerchief did an egyptian to my mother give . she was a charmer , and could almost read the thoughts of people . she told her , while she kept it , ’ twould make her amiable and subdue my father entirely to her love . but if she lost it , or made a gift of it , my father ’ s eye should hold her loathed , and his spirits should hunt after new fancies : she , dying , gave it me , and bid me , when my fate would have me wive , to give it her . i did so ; and take heed on ’ t , make it a darling like your precious eye . to lose ’ t or give ’ t away were such perdition as nothing else could match .
shakespeare	othello	desdemona . is ’ t possible ? othello . ’ tis true . there ’ s magic in the web of it . a sibyl , that had number ’ d in the world the sun to course two hundred compasses , in her prophetic fury sew ’ d the work ; the worms were hallow ’ d that did breed the silk , and it was dyed in mummy , which the skillful conserv ’ d of maiden ’ s hearts .

shakespeare	othello	othello . how ? desdemona . i say it is not lost . othello . fetch ’ t , let me see ’ t . desdemona . why , so i can , sir , but i will not now . this is a trick to put me from my suit . pray you , let cassio be receiv ’ d again .

shakespeare	othello	cassio . madam , my former suit : i do beseech you that by your virtuous means i may again exist , and be a member of his love , whom i , with all the office of my heart , entirely honour . i would not be delay ’ d . if my offence be of such mortal kind that nor my service past , nor present sorrows , nor purpos ’ d merit in futurity , can ransom me into his love again , but to know so must be my benefit ; so shall i clothe me in a forc ’ d content , and shut myself up in some other course to fortune ’ s alms .
shakespeare	othello	desdemona . alas , thrice-gentle cassio , my advocation is not now in tune ; my lord is not my lord ; nor should i know him were he in favour as in humour alter ’ d . so help me every spirit sanctified , as i have spoken for you all my best , and stood within the blank of his displeasure for my free speech ! you must awhile be patient . what i can do i will ; and more i will than for myself i dare . let that suffice you .
shakespeare	othello	iago . is my lord angry ? emilia . he went hence but now , and certainly in strange unquietness . iago . can he be angry ? i have seen the cannon , when it hath blown his ranks into the air and , like the devil , from his very arm puff ’ d his own brother , and can he be angry ? something of moment then . i will go meet him . there ’ s matter in ’ t indeed if he be angry .
shakespeare	othello	desdemona . i prithee do so . [ _exit iago._ ] something sure of state , either from venice , or some unhatch ’ d practice made demonstrable here in cyprus to him , hath puddled his clear spirit , and in such cases men ’ s natures wrangle with inferior things , though great ones are their object . ’ tis even so . for let our finger ache , and it indues our other healthful members even to that sense of pain . nay , we must think men are not gods , nor of them look for such observancy as fits the bridal . beshrew me much , emilia , i was ( unhandsome warrior as i am ) arraigning his unkindness with my soul ; but now i find i had suborn ’ d the witness , and he ’ s indicted falsely .
shakespeare	othello	emilia . pray heaven it be state matters , as you think , and no conception nor no jealous toy concerning you . desdemona . alas the day , i never gave him cause ! emilia . but jealous souls will not be answer ’ d so ; they are not ever jealous for the cause , but jealous for they are jealous : ’ tis a monster begot upon itself , born on itself .
shakespeare	othello	desdemona . heaven keep that monster from othello ’ s mind ! emilia . lady , amen . desdemona . i will go seek him . cassio , walk hereabout : if i do find him fit , i ’ ll move your suit , and seek to effect it to my uttermost .
shakespeare	othello	cassio . i humbly thank your ladyship . [ _exeunt desdemona and emilia._ ] enter bianca . bianca . save you , friend cassio ! cassio . what make you from home ? how is it with you , my most fair bianca ? i ’ faith , sweet love , i was coming to your house .
shakespeare	othello	bianca . and i was going to your lodging , cassio . what , keep a week away ? seven days and nights ? eight score eight hours , and lovers ’ absent hours , more tedious than the dial eight score times ? o weary reckoning !
shakespeare	othello	cassio . pardon me , bianca . i have this while with leaden thoughts been press ’ d , but i shall in a more continuate time strike off this score of absence . sweet bianca , [ _giving her desdemona ’ s handkerchief._ ]
shakespeare	othello	take me this work out . bianca . o cassio , whence came this ? this is some token from a newer friend . to the felt absence now i feel a cause . is ’ t come to this ? well , well .
shakespeare	othello	cassio . go to , woman ! throw your vile guesses in the devil ’ s teeth , from whence you have them . you are jealous now that this is from some mistress , some remembrance . no , in good troth , bianca .
shakespeare	othello	bianca . why , whose is it ? cassio . i know not neither . i found it in my chamber . i like the work well . ere it be demanded , as like enough it will , i ’ d have it copied . take it , and do ’ t , and leave me for this time .
shakespeare	othello	bianca . leave you , wherefore ? cassio . i do attend here on the general , and think it no addition , nor my wish , to have him see me woman ’ d . bianca . why , i pray you ?
shakespeare	othello	cassio . not that i love you not . bianca . but that you do not love me . i pray you bring me on the way a little , and say if i shall see you soon at night .
shakespeare	othello	cassio . ’ tis but a little way that i can bring you , for i attend here . but i ’ ll see you soon . bianca . ’ tis very good ; i must be circumstanc ’ d . [ _exeunt._ ] act iv

shakespeare	othello	othello . naked in bed , iago , and not mean harm ? it is hypocrisy against the devil : they that mean virtuously and yet do so , the devil their virtue tempts , and they tempt heaven .
shakespeare	othello	iago . so they do nothing , ’ tis a venial slip . but if i give my wife a handkerchief— othello . what then ? iago . why then , ’ tis hers , my lord , and being hers , she may , i think , bestow ’ t on any man .
shakespeare	othello	othello . she is protectress of her honour too . may she give that ? iago . her honour is an essence that ’ s not seen ; they have it very oft that have it not : but for the handkerchief—
shakespeare	othello	othello . by heaven , i would most gladly have forgot it . thou said ’ st ( o , it comes o ’ er my memory , as doth the raven o ’ er the infected house , boding to all ) he had my handkerchief .
shakespeare	othello	iago . ay , what of that ? othello . that ’ s not so good now . iago . what if i had said i had seen him do you wrong ? or heard him say ( as knaves be such abroad , who having , by their own importunate suit , or voluntary dotage of some mistress , convinced or supplied them , can not choose but they must blab . )
shakespeare	othello	othello . hath he said anything ? iago . he hath , my lord , but be you well assur ’ d , no more than he ’ ll unswear . othello . what hath he said ? iago . faith , that he did—i know not what he did .
shakespeare	othello	othello . what ? what ? iago . lie . othello . with her ? iago . with her , on her , what you will . othello . lie with her ! lie on her ! —we say lie on her when they belie her.—lie with her ! that ’ s fulsome . handkerchief—confessions—handkerchief ! to confess , and be hanged for his labour . first , to be hanged , and then to confess . i tremble at it . nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some instruction . it is not words that shake me thus . pish ! noses , ears , and lips . is ’ t possible ? —confess ? —handkerchief ? —o devil ! —
shakespeare	othello	[ _falls in a trance._ ] iago . work on , my medicine , work ! thus credulous fools are caught , and many worthy and chaste dames even thus , all guiltless , meet reproach . what , ho ! my lord ! my lord , i say ! othello !
shakespeare	othello	enter cassio . how now , cassio ! cassio . what ’ s the matter ? iago . my lord is fallen into an epilepsy . this is his second fit . he had one yesterday . cassio . rub him about the temples .
shakespeare	othello	iago . no , forbear ; the lethargy must have his quiet course . if not , he foams at mouth , and by and by breaks out to savage madness . look , he stirs : do you withdraw yourself a little while , he will recover straight . when he is gone , i would on great occasion speak with you .
shakespeare	othello	[ _exit cassio._ ] how is it , general ? have you not hurt your head ? othello . dost thou mock me ? iago . i mock you ? no , by heaven . would you would bear your fortune like a man !
shakespeare	othello	othello . a horned man ’ s a monster and a beast . iago . there ’ s many a beast , then , in a populous city , and many a civil monster . othello . did he confess it ? iago . good sir , be a man . think every bearded fellow that ’ s but yok ’ d may draw with you . there ’ s millions now alive that nightly lie in those unproper beds which they dare swear peculiar : your case is better . o , ’ tis the spite of hell , the fiend ’ s arch-mock , to lip a wanton in a secure couch , and to suppose her chaste ! no , let me know , and knowing what i am , i know what she shall be .
shakespeare	othello	othello . o , thou art wise , ’ tis certain . iago . stand you awhile apart , confine yourself but in a patient list . whilst you were here o ’ erwhelmed with your grief , ( a passion most unsuiting such a man ) cassio came hither . i shifted him away , and laid good ’ scuse upon your ecstasy , bade him anon return , and here speak with me , the which he promis ’ d . do but encave yourself , and mark the fleers , the gibes , and notable scorns , that dwell in every region of his face ; for i will make him tell the tale anew , where , how , how oft , how long ago , and when he hath , and is again to cope your wife : i say , but mark his gesture . marry , patience , or i shall say you are all in all in spleen , and nothing of a man .
shakespeare	othello	othello . dost thou hear , iago ? i will be found most cunning in my patience ; but , —dost thou hear ? —most bloody . iago . that ’ s not amiss . but yet keep time in all . will you withdraw ?
shakespeare	othello	[ _othello withdraws._ ] now will i question cassio of bianca , a housewife that by selling her desires buys herself bread and clothes : it is a creature that dotes on cassio , ( as ’ tis the strumpet ’ s plague to beguile many and be beguil ’ d by one . ) he , when he hears of her , can not refrain from the excess of laughter . here he comes .
shakespeare	othello	enter cassio . as he shall smile othello shall go mad , and his unbookish jealousy must construe poor cassio ’ s smiles , gestures , and light behaviour quite in the wrong . how do you now , lieutenant ?
shakespeare	othello	cassio . the worser that you give me the addition whose want even kills me . iago . ply desdemona well , and you are sure on ’ t . [ _speaking lower._ ] now , if this suit lay in bianca ’ s power , how quickly should you speed !
shakespeare	othello	cassio . alas , poor caitiff ! othello . [ _aside._ ] look how he laughs already ! iago . i never knew a woman love man so . cassio . alas , poor rogue ! i think , i ’ faith , she loves me .
shakespeare	othello	othello . [ _aside._ ] now he denies it faintly and laughs it out . iago . do you hear , cassio ? othello . now he importunes him to tell it o ’ er . go to , well said , well said .
shakespeare	othello	iago . she gives it out that you shall marry her . do you intend it ? cassio . ha , ha , ha ! othello . do you triumph , roman ? do you triumph ? cassio . i marry her ? what ? a customer ? i prithee , bear some charity to my wit , do not think it so unwholesome . ha , ha , ha !
shakespeare	othello	othello . so , so , so , so . they laugh that wins . iago . faith , the cry goes that you shall marry her . cassio . prithee say true . iago . i am a very villain else .
shakespeare	othello	othello . have you scored me ? well . cassio . this is the monkey ’ s own giving out . she is persuaded i will marry her , out of her own love and flattery , not out of my promise .
shakespeare	othello	othello . iago beckons me . now he begins the story . cassio . she was here even now . she haunts me in every place . i was the other day talking on the sea-bank with certain venetians , and thither comes the bauble , and falls thus about my neck .
shakespeare	othello	othello . crying , “ o dear cassio ! ” as it were : his gesture imports it . cassio . so hangs , and lolls , and weeps upon me ; so hales and pulls me . ha , ha , ha ! othello . now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber . o , i see that nose of yours , but not that dog i shall throw it to .
shakespeare	othello	cassio . well , i must leave her company . iago . before me ! look where she comes . enter bianca . cassio . ’ tis such another fitchew ! marry , a perfum ’ d one . what do you mean by this haunting of me ?
shakespeare	othello	bianca . let the devil and his dam haunt you ! what did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now ? i was a fine fool to take it . i must take out the work ? a likely piece of work , that you should find it in your chamber and not know who left it there ! this is some minx ’ s token , and i must take out the work ? there , give it your hobby-horse . wheresoever you had it , i ’ ll take out no work on ’ t .
shakespeare	othello	cassio . how now , my sweet bianca ? how now , how now ? othello . by heaven , that should be my handkerchief ! bianca . if you ’ ll come to supper tonight , you may . if you will not , come when you are next prepared for .
shakespeare	othello	[ _exit._ ] iago . after her , after her . cassio . faith , i must ; she ’ ll rail in the street else . iago . will you sup there ? cassio . faith , i intend so . iago . well , i may chance to see you , for i would very fain speak with you .
shakespeare	othello	cassio . prithee come , will you ? iago . go to ; say no more . [ _exit cassio._ ] othello . [ _coming forward._ ] how shall i murder him , iago ? iago . did you perceive how he laughed at his vice ?
shakespeare	othello	othello . o iago ! iago . and did you see the handkerchief ? othello . was that mine ? iago . yours , by this hand : and to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife ! she gave it him , and he hath given it his whore .
shakespeare	othello	othello . i would have him nine years a-killing . a fine woman , a fair woman , a sweet woman ! iago . nay , you must forget that . othello . ay , let her rot , and perish , and be damned tonight , for she shall not live . no , my heart is turned to stone ; i strike it , and it hurts my hand . o , the world hath not a sweeter creature . she might lie by an emperor ’ s side , and command him tasks .
shakespeare	othello	iago . nay , that ’ s not your way . othello . hang her , i do but say what she is . so delicate with her needle , an admirable musician ! o , she will sing the savageness out of a bear ! of so high and plenteous wit and invention !
shakespeare	othello	iago . she ’ s the worse for all this . othello . o , a thousand , a thousand times : and then of so gentle a condition ! iago . ay , too gentle . othello . nay , that ’ s certain . but yet the pity of it , iago ! o iago , the pity of it , iago !
shakespeare	othello	iago . if you are so fond over her iniquity , give her patent to offend , for if it touch not you , it comes near nobody . othello . i will chop her into messes . cuckold me !
shakespeare	othello	iago . o , ’ tis foul in her . othello . with mine officer ! iago . that ’ s fouler . othello . get me some poison , iago ; this night . i ’ ll not expostulate with her , lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again . this night , iago .
shakespeare	othello	iago . do it not with poison , strangle her in her bed , even the bed she hath contaminated . othello . good , good . the justice of it pleases . very good . iago . and for cassio , let me be his undertaker . you shall hear more by midnight .

shakespeare	othello	[ _opens the packet and reads._ ] desdemona . and what ’ s the news , good cousin lodovico ? iago . i am very glad to see you , signior . welcome to cyprus . lodovico . i thank you . how does lieutenant cassio ?
shakespeare	othello	iago . lives , sir . desdemona . cousin , there ’ s fall ’ n between him and my lord an unkind breach , but you shall make all well . othello . are you sure of that ? desdemona . my lord ?
shakespeare	othello	othello . [ _reads._ ] “ this fail you not to do , as you will— ” lodovico . he did not call ; he ’ s busy in the paper . is there division ’ twixt my lord and cassio ? desdemona . a most unhappy one . i would do much to atone them , for the love i bear to cassio .
shakespeare	othello	othello . fire and brimstone ! desdemona . my lord ? othello . are you wise ? desdemona . what , is he angry ? lodovico . may be the letter mov ’ d him ; for , as i think , they do command him home , deputing cassio in his government .
shakespeare	othello	desdemona . trust me , i am glad on ’ t . othello . indeed ! desdemona . my lord ? othello . i am glad to see you mad . desdemona . why , sweet othello ? othello . devil ! [ _striking her._ ] desdemona . i have not deserv ’ d this .
shakespeare	othello	lodovico . my lord , this would not be believ ’ d in venice , though i should swear i saw ’ t : ’ tis very much . make her amends . she weeps . othello . o devil , devil ! if that the earth could teem with woman ’ s tears , each drop she falls would prove a crocodile . out of my sight !
shakespeare	othello	desdemona . i will not stay to offend you . [ _going._ ] lodovico . truly , an obedient lady . i do beseech your lordship , call her back . othello . mistress ! desdemona . my lord ? othello . what would you with her , sir ?
shakespeare	othello	lodovico . who , i , my lord ? othello . ay , you did wish that i would make her turn . sir , she can turn , and turn , and yet go on , and turn again . and she can weep , sir , weep ; and she ’ s obedient , as you say , obedient , very obedient . proceed you in your tears . concerning this , sir , —o well-painted passion ! i am commanded home.—get you away ; i ’ ll send for you anon.—sir , i obey the mandate , and will return to venice.—hence , avaunt !
shakespeare	othello	[ _exit desdemona._ ] cassio shall have my place . and , sir , tonight , i do entreat that we may sup together . you are welcome , sir , to cyprus . goats and monkeys ! [ _exit._ ] lodovico . is this the noble moor , whom our full senate call all in all sufficient ? is this the nature whom passion could not shake ? whose solid virtue the shot of accident nor dart of chance could neither graze nor pierce ?
shakespeare	othello	iago . he is much chang ’ d . lodovico . are his wits safe ? is he not light of brain ? iago . he ’ s that he is . i may not breathe my censure what he might be . if what he might he is not , i would to heaven he were !
shakespeare	othello	lodovico . what , strike his wife ? iago . faith , that was not so well ; yet would i knew that stroke would prove the worst ! lodovico . is it his use ? or did the letters work upon his blood , and new-create this fault ?
shakespeare	othello	iago . alas , alas ! it is not honesty in me to speak what i have seen and known . you shall observe him , and his own courses will denote him so that i may save my speech : do but go after , and mark how he continues .

shakespeare	midsummer	oberon . stand aside . the noise they make will cause demetrius to awake . puck . then will two at once woo one . that must needs be sport alone ; and those things do best please me that befall prepost ’ rously .
shakespeare	midsummer	enter lysander and helena . lysander . why should you think that i should woo in scorn ? scorn and derision never come in tears . look when i vow , i weep ; and vows so born , in their nativity all truth appears . how can these things in me seem scorn to you , bearing the badge of faith , to prove them true ?
shakespeare	midsummer	helena . you do advance your cunning more and more . when truth kills truth , o devilish-holy fray ! these vows are hermia ’ s : will you give her o ’ er ? weigh oath with oath , and you will nothing weigh : your vows to her and me , put in two scales , will even weigh ; and both as light as tales .
shakespeare	midsummer	lysander . i had no judgment when to her i swore . helena . nor none , in my mind , now you give her o ’ er . lysander . demetrius loves her , and he loves not you .
shakespeare	midsummer	demetrius . [ _waking._ ] o helen , goddess , nymph , perfect , divine ! to what , my love , shall i compare thine eyne ? crystal is muddy . o how ripe in show thy lips , those kissing cherries , tempting grow ! that pure congealèd white , high taurus ’ snow , fann ’ d with the eastern wind , turns to a crow when thou hold ’ st up thy hand . o , let me kiss this princess of pure white , this seal of bliss !
shakespeare	midsummer	helena . o spite ! o hell ! i see you all are bent to set against me for your merriment . if you were civil , and knew courtesy , you would not do me thus much injury . can you not hate me , as i know you do , but you must join in souls to mock me too ? if you were men , as men you are in show , you would not use a gentle lady so ; to vow , and swear , and superpraise my parts , when i am sure you hate me with your hearts . you both are rivals , and love hermia ; and now both rivals , to mock helena . a trim exploit , a manly enterprise , to conjure tears up in a poor maid ’ s eyes with your derision ! none of noble sort would so offend a virgin , and extort a poor soul ’ s patience , all to make you sport .
shakespeare	midsummer	lysander . you are unkind , demetrius ; be not so , for you love hermia ; this you know i know . and here , with all good will , with all my heart , in hermia ’ s love i yield you up my part ; and yours of helena to me bequeath , whom i do love and will do till my death .
shakespeare	midsummer	helena . never did mockers waste more idle breath . demetrius . lysander , keep thy hermia ; i will none . if e ’ er i lov ’ d her , all that love is gone . my heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn ’ d ; and now to helen is it home return ’ d , there to remain .
shakespeare	midsummer	lysander . helen , it is not so . demetrius . disparage not the faith thou dost not know , lest to thy peril thou aby it dear . look where thy love comes ; yonder is thy dear .
shakespeare	midsummer	enter hermia . hermia . dark night , that from the eye his function takes , the ear more quick of apprehension makes ; wherein it doth impair the seeing sense , it pays the hearing double recompense . thou art not by mine eye , lysander , found ; mine ear , i thank it , brought me to thy sound . but why unkindly didst thou leave me so ?
shakespeare	midsummer	lysander . why should he stay whom love doth press to go ? hermia . what love could press lysander from my side ? lysander . lysander ’ s love , that would not let him bide , fair helena , who more engilds the night than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light . why seek ’ st thou me ? could not this make thee know the hate i bare thee made me leave thee so ?
shakespeare	midsummer	hermia . you speak not as you think ; it can not be . helena . lo , she is one of this confederacy ! now i perceive they have conjoin ’ d all three to fashion this false sport in spite of me . injurious hermia , most ungrateful maid ! have you conspir ’ d , have you with these contriv ’ d , to bait me with this foul derision ? is all the counsel that we two have shar ’ d , the sisters ’ vows , the hours that we have spent , when we have chid the hasty-footed time for parting us—o , is all forgot ? all school-days ’ friendship , childhood innocence ? we , hermia , like two artificial gods , have with our needles created both one flower , both on one sampler , sitting on one cushion , both warbling of one song , both in one key , as if our hands , our sides , voices , and minds , had been incorporate . so we grew together , like to a double cherry , seeming parted , but yet a union in partition , two lovely berries moulded on one stem ; so , with two seeming bodies , but one heart ; two of the first , like coats in heraldry , due but to one , and crownèd with one crest . and will you rent our ancient love asunder , to join with men in scorning your poor friend ? it is not friendly , ’ tis not maidenly . our sex , as well as i , may chide you for it , though i alone do feel the injury .
shakespeare	midsummer	hermia . i am amazèd at your passionate words : i scorn you not ; it seems that you scorn me . helena . have you not set lysander , as in scorn , to follow me , and praise my eyes and face ? and made your other love , demetrius , who even but now did spurn me with his foot , to call me goddess , nymph , divine and rare , precious , celestial ? wherefore speaks he this to her he hates ? and wherefore doth lysander deny your love , so rich within his soul , and tender me , forsooth , affection , but by your setting on , by your consent ? what though i be not so in grace as you , so hung upon with love , so fortunate , but miserable most , to love unlov ’ d ? this you should pity rather than despise .
shakespeare	midsummer	hermia . i understand not what you mean by this . helena . ay , do . persever , counterfeit sad looks , make mouths upon me when i turn my back , wink each at other ; hold the sweet jest up . this sport , well carried , shall be chronicled . if you have any pity , grace , or manners , you would not make me such an argument . but fare ye well . ’ tis partly my own fault , which death , or absence , soon shall remedy .
shakespeare	midsummer	lysander . stay , gentle helena ; hear my excuse ; my love , my life , my soul , fair helena ! helena . o excellent ! hermia . sweet , do not scorn her so . demetrius . if she can not entreat , i can compel .
shakespeare	midsummer	lysander . thou canst compel no more than she entreat ; thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers . helen , i love thee , by my life i do ; i swear by that which i will lose for thee to prove him false that says i love thee not .
shakespeare	midsummer	demetrius . i say i love thee more than he can do . lysander . if thou say so , withdraw , and prove it too . demetrius . quick , come . hermia . lysander , whereto tends all this ?
shakespeare	midsummer	lysander . away , you ethiope ! demetrius . no , no . he will seem to break loose . take on as you would follow , but yet come not . you are a tame man , go ! lysander . hang off , thou cat , thou burr ! vile thing , let loose , or i will shake thee from me like a serpent .
shakespeare	midsummer	hermia . why are you grown so rude ? what change is this , sweet love ? lysander . thy love ? out , tawny tartar , out ! out , loathèd medicine ! o hated potion , hence ! hermia . do you not jest ?
shakespeare	midsummer	helena . yes , sooth , and so do you . lysander . demetrius , i will keep my word with thee . demetrius . i would i had your bond ; for i perceive a weak bond holds you ; i ’ ll not trust your word .
shakespeare	midsummer	lysander . what , should i hurt her , strike her , kill her dead ? although i hate her , i ’ ll not harm her so . hermia . what , can you do me greater harm than hate ? hate me ? wherefore ? o me ! what news , my love ? am not i hermia ? are not you lysander ? i am as fair now as i was erewhile . since night you lov ’ d me ; yet since night you left me . why then , you left me—o , the gods forbid ! — in earnest , shall i say ?
shakespeare	midsummer	lysander . ay , by my life ; and never did desire to see thee more . therefore be out of hope , of question , of doubt ; be certain , nothing truer ; ’ tis no jest that i do hate thee and love helena .
shakespeare	midsummer	hermia . o me ! you juggler ! you cankerblossom ! you thief of love ! what ! have you come by night and stol ’ n my love ’ s heart from him ? helena . fine , i ’ faith ! have you no modesty , no maiden shame , no touch of bashfulness ? what , will you tear impatient answers from my gentle tongue ? fie , fie , you counterfeit , you puppet , you !
shakespeare	midsummer	hermia . puppet ! why so ? ay , that way goes the game . now i perceive that she hath made compare between our statures ; she hath urg ’ d her height ; and with her personage , her tall personage , her height , forsooth , she hath prevail ’ d with him . and are you grown so high in his esteem because i am so dwarfish and so low ? how low am i , thou painted maypole ? speak , how low am i ? i am not yet so low but that my nails can reach unto thine eyes .
shakespeare	midsummer	helena . i pray you , though you mock me , gentlemen , let her not hurt me . i was never curst ; i have no gift at all in shrewishness ; i am a right maid for my cowardice ; let her not strike me . you perhaps may think , because she is something lower than myself , that i can match her .
shakespeare	midsummer	hermia . lower ! hark , again . helena . good hermia , do not be so bitter with me . i evermore did love you , hermia , did ever keep your counsels , never wrong ’ d you , save that , in love unto demetrius , i told him of your stealth unto this wood . he follow ’ d you ; for love i follow ’ d him ; but he hath chid me hence , and threaten ’ d me to strike me , spurn me , nay , to kill me too : and now , so you will let me quiet go , to athens will i bear my folly back , and follow you no further . let me go : you see how simple and how fond i am .
shakespeare	midsummer	hermia . why , get you gone . who is ’ t that hinders you ? helena . a foolish heart that i leave here behind . hermia . what ! with lysander ? helena . with demetrius . lysander . be not afraid ; she shall not harm thee , helena .
shakespeare	midsummer	demetrius . no , sir , she shall not , though you take her part . helena . o , when she ’ s angry , she is keen and shrewd . she was a vixen when she went to school , and though she be but little , she is fierce .
shakespeare	midsummer	hermia . little again ! nothing but low and little ? why will you suffer her to flout me thus ? let me come to her . lysander . get you gone , you dwarf ; you minimus , of hind ’ ring knot-grass made ; you bead , you acorn .
shakespeare	midsummer	demetrius . you are too officious in her behalf that scorns your services . let her alone . speak not of helena ; take not her part ; for if thou dost intend never so little show of love to her , thou shalt aby it .
shakespeare	midsummer	lysander . now she holds me not . now follow , if thou dar ’ st , to try whose right , of thine or mine , is most in helena . demetrius . follow ! nay , i ’ ll go with thee , cheek by jole .
shakespeare	midsummer	[ _exeunt lysander and demetrius._ ] hermia . you , mistress , all this coil is long of you . nay , go not back . helena . i will not trust you , i , nor longer stay in your curst company . your hands than mine are quicker for a fray . my legs are longer though , to run away .
shakespeare	midsummer	[ _exit._ ] hermia . i am amaz ’ d , and know not what to say . [ _exit , pursuing helena._ ] oberon . this is thy negligence : still thou mistak ’ st , or else commit ’ st thy knaveries willfully . puck . believe me , king of shadows , i mistook . did not you tell me i should know the man by the athenian garments he had on ? and so far blameless proves my enterprise that i have ’ nointed an athenian ’ s eyes : and so far am i glad it so did sort , as this their jangling i esteem a sport .
shakespeare	midsummer	oberon . thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight . hie therefore , robin , overcast the night ; the starry welkin cover thou anon with drooping fog , as black as acheron , and lead these testy rivals so astray as one come not within another ’ s way . like to lysander sometime frame thy tongue , then stir demetrius up with bitter wrong ; and sometime rail thou like demetrius . and from each other look thou lead them thus , till o ’ er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep with leaden legs and batty wings doth creep . then crush this herb into lysander ’ s eye , whose liquor hath this virtuous property , to take from thence all error with his might and make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight . when they next wake , all this derision shall seem a dream and fruitless vision ; and back to athens shall the lovers wend , with league whose date till death shall never end . whiles i in this affair do thee employ , i ’ ll to my queen , and beg her indian boy ; and then i will her charmèd eye release from monster ’ s view , and all things shall be peace .
shakespeare	midsummer	puck . my fairy lord , this must be done with haste , for night ’ s swift dragons cut the clouds full fast ; and yonder shines aurora ’ s harbinger , at whose approach , ghosts wandering here and there troop home to churchyards . damnèd spirits all , that in cross-ways and floods have burial , already to their wormy beds are gone ; for fear lest day should look their shames upon , they wilfully themselves exile from light , and must for aye consort with black-brow ’ d night .
shakespeare	midsummer	oberon . but we are spirits of another sort : i with the morning ’ s love have oft made sport ; and , like a forester , the groves may tread even till the eastern gate , all fiery-red , opening on neptune with fair blessèd beams , turns into yellow gold his salt-green streams . but , notwithstanding , haste , make no delay . we may effect this business yet ere day .
shakespeare	midsummer	[ _exit oberon._ ] puck . up and down , up and down , i will lead them up and down . i am fear ’ d in field and town . goblin , lead them up and down . here comes one .
shakespeare	midsummer	enter lysander . lysander . where art thou , proud demetrius ? speak thou now . puck . here , villain , drawn and ready . where art thou ? lysander . i will be with thee straight . puck . follow me then to plainer ground .
shakespeare	midsummer	[ _exit lysander as following the voice._ ] enter demetrius . demetrius . lysander , speak again . thou runaway , thou coward , art thou fled ? speak . in some bush ? where dost thou hide thy head ? puck . thou coward , art thou bragging to the stars , telling the bushes that thou look ’ st for wars , and wilt not come ? come , recreant , come , thou child ! i ’ ll whip thee with a rod . he is defil ’ d that draws a sword on thee .
shakespeare	midsummer	demetrius . yea , art thou there ? puck . follow my voice ; we ’ ll try no manhood here . [ _exeunt._ ] enter lysander . lysander . he goes before me , and still dares me on ; when i come where he calls , then he is gone . the villain is much lighter-heel ’ d than i : i follow ’ d fast , but faster he did fly , that fallen am i in dark uneven way , and here will rest me . come , thou gentle day ! [ _lies down._ ] for if but once thou show me thy grey light , i ’ ll find demetrius , and revenge this spite .
shakespeare	midsummer	[ _sleeps._ ] enter puck and demetrius . puck . ho , ho , ho ! coward , why com ’ st thou not ? demetrius . abide me , if thou dar ’ st ; for well i wot thou runn ’ st before me , shifting every place , and dar ’ st not stand , nor look me in the face . where art thou ?
shakespeare	midsummer	puck . come hither ; i am here . demetrius . nay , then , thou mock ’ st me . thou shalt buy this dear if ever i thy face by daylight see : now go thy way . faintness constraineth me to measure out my length on this cold bed . by day ’ s approach look to be visited .
shakespeare	midsummer	[ _lies down and sleeps._ ] enter helena . helena . o weary night , o long and tedious night , abate thy hours ! shine , comforts , from the east , that i may back to athens by daylight , from these that my poor company detest . and sleep , that sometimes shuts up sorrow ’ s eye , steal me awhile from mine own company .
shakespeare	midsummer	[ _sleeps._ ] puck . yet but three ? come one more . two of both kinds makes up four . here she comes , curst and sad . cupid is a knavish lad thus to make poor females mad .
shakespeare	midsummer	enter hermia . hermia . never so weary , never so in woe , bedabbled with the dew , and torn with briers , i can no further crawl , no further go ; my legs can keep no pace with my desires . here will i rest me till the break of day . heavens shield lysander , if they mean a fray !
shakespeare	midsummer	[ _lies down._ ] puck . on the ground sleep sound . i ’ ll apply to your eye , gentle lover , remedy . [ _squeezing the juice on lysander ’ s eye._ ] when thou wak ’ st , thou tak ’ st true delight in the sight of thy former lady ’ s eye . and the country proverb known , that every man should take his own , in your waking shall be shown : jack shall have jill ; nought shall go ill ; the man shall have his mare again , and all shall be well .
shakespeare	midsummer	[ _exit puck._ ] act iv scene i . the wood lysander , demetrius , helena and hermia still asleep . enter titania and bottom ; peaseblossom , cobweb , moth , mustardseed and other fairies attending ; oberon behind , unseen .
shakespeare	midsummer	titania . come , sit thee down upon this flowery bed , while i thy amiable cheeks do coy , and stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head , and kiss thy fair large ears , my gentle joy .
shakespeare	midsummer	bottom . where ’ s peaseblossom ? peaseblossom . ready . bottom . scratch my head , peaseblossom . where ’ s monsieur cobweb ? cobweb . ready . bottom . monsieur cobweb ; good monsieur , get you your weapons in your hand and kill me a red-hipped humble-bee on the top of a thistle ; and , good monsieur , bring me the honey-bag . do not fret yourself too much in the action , monsieur ; and , good monsieur , have a care the honey-bag break not ; i would be loath to have you overflown with a honey-bag , signior . where ’ s monsieur mustardseed ?
shakespeare	midsummer	mustardseed . ready . bottom . give me your neaf , monsieur mustardseed . pray you , leave your courtesy , good monsieur . mustardseed . what ’ s your will ? bottom . nothing , good monsieur , but to help cavalery cobweb to scratch . i must to the barber ’ s , monsieur , for methinks i am marvellous hairy about the face ; and i am such a tender ass , if my hair do but tickle me , i must scratch .
