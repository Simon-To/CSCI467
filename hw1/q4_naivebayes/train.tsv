austen	emma	he was too angry to say another word ; her manner too decided to invite supplication ; and in this state of swelling resentment , and mutually deep mortification , they had to continue together a few minutes longer , for the fears of mr. woodhouse had confined them to a foot-pace . if there had not been so much anger , there would have been desperate awkwardness ; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment . without knowing when the carriage turned into vicarage lane , or when it stopped , they found themselves , all at once , at the door of his house ; and he was out before another syllable passed.—emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good night . the compliment was just returned , coldly and proudly ; and , under indescribable irritation of spirits , she was then conveyed to hartfield .
austen	emma	very sincerely did emma wish to do so ; but it was not immediately in her power . she was obliged to stop and think . she was not thoroughly comfortable herself . the young man ’ s conduct , and his sister ’ s , seemed the result of real feeling , and she could not but pity them . as harriet described it , there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour . but she had believed them to be well-meaning , worthy people before ; and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion ? it was folly to be disturbed by it . of course , he must be sorry to lose her—they must be all sorry . ambition , as well as love , had probably been mortified . they might all have hoped to rise by harriet ’ s acquaintance : and besides , what was the value of harriet ’ s description ? —so easily pleased—so little discerning ; —what signified her praise ?
austen	emma	“ then she is a greater simpleton than i ever believed her . what is the foolish girl about ? ” “ oh ! to be sure , ” cried emma , “ it is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage . a man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her . ”
austen	emma	“ you have some news to hear , now you are come back , that will rather surprize you. ” “ have i ? ” said he quietly , and looking at her ; “ of what nature ? ” “ oh ! the best nature in the world—a wedding . ”
austen	emma	“ well , i always shall think that you play quite as well as she does , or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out . mr. cole said how much taste you had ; and mr. frank churchill talked a great deal about your taste , and that he valued taste much more than execution . ”
austen	emma	“ i do not ask whether you are musical , mrs. elton . upon these occasions , a lady ’ s character generally precedes her ; and highbury has long known that you are a superior performer . ”
austen	emma	they were now approaching the cottage , and all idle topics were superseded . emma was very compassionate ; and the distresses of the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness , her counsel and her patience , as from her purse . she understood their ways , could allow for their ignorance and their temptations , had no romantic expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had done so little ; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy , and always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good-will . in the present instance , it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit ; and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice , she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene as made her say to harriet , as they walked away ,
austen	emma	this letter , however , was written , and sealed , and sent . the business was finished , and harriet safe . she was rather low all the evening , but emma could allow for her amiable regrets , and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection , sometimes by bringing forward the idea of mr. elton .
austen	emma	“ let me entreat you , ” cried mr. elton ; “ it would indeed be a delight ! let me entreat you , miss woodhouse , to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend . i know what your drawings are . how could you suppose me ignorant ? is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers ; and has not mrs. weston some inimitable figure-pieces in her drawing-room , at randalls ? ”
austen	emma	“ only one more , papa ; only for mr. elton . poor mr. elton ! you like mr. elton , papa , —i must look about for a wife for him . there is nobody in highbury who deserves him—and he has been here a whole year , and has fitted up his house so comfortably , that it would be a shame to have him single any longer—and i thought when he was joining their hands to-day , he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him ! i think very well of mr. elton , and this is the only way i have of doing him a service . ”
austen	emma	“ i am here on no business of my own , ” said emma ; “ i am only waiting for my friend . she will probably have soon done , and then we shall go home . but you had better go with mrs. weston and hear the instrument . ”
austen	emma	mr. knightley seemed to be trying not to smile ; and succeeded without difficulty , upon mrs. elton ’ s beginning to talk to him . volume iii chapter i a very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy emma as to the nature of her agitation on hearing this news of frank churchill . she was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed ; it was for him . her own attachment had really subsided into a mere nothing ; it was not worth thinking of ; —but if he , who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the two , were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had taken away , it would be very distressing . if a separation of two months should not have cooled him , there were dangers and evils before her : —caution for him and for herself would be necessary . she did not mean to have her own affections entangled again , and it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his .
austen	emma	“ true , sir ; and emma , because she had miss fairfax. ” emma saw his anxiety , and wishing to appease it , at least for the present , said , and with a sincerity which no one could question—
austen	emma	serious she was , very serious in her thankfulness , and in her resolutions ; and yet there was no preventing a laugh , sometimes in the very midst of them . she must laugh at such a close ! such an end of the doleful disappointment of five weeks back ! such a heart—such a harriet !
austen	emma	“ ah ! you clever creature , that ’ s very true . what a thinking brain you have ! i say , jane , what a perfect character you and i should make , if we could be shaken together . my liveliness and your solidity would produce perfection.—not that i presume to insinuate , however , that _some_ people may not think _you_ perfection already.—but hush ! —not a word , if you please . ”
austen	emma	“ and i , mr. knightley , am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm . with all dear emma ’ s little faults , she is an excellent creature . where shall we see a better daughter , or a kinder sister , or a truer friend ? no , no ; she has qualities which may be trusted ; she will never lead any one really wrong ; she will make no lasting blunder ; where emma errs once , she is in the right a hundred times . ”
austen	emma	emma , in good spirits too , from the amusement afforded her mind by the expectation of mr. frank churchill , was willing to forget his late improprieties , and be as well satisfied with him as before , and on his making harriet his very first subject , was ready to listen with most friendly smiles .
austen	emma	mrs. weston was disengaged and emma began again— “ mr . frank churchill writes one of the best gentleman ’ s hands i ever saw. ” “ i do not admire it , ” said mr. knightley . “ it is too small—wants strength . it is like a woman ’ s writing . ”
austen	emma	“ and so you absolutely opened what was directed to her ! oh ! mr. weston— ( laughing affectedly ) i must protest against that.—a most dangerous precedent indeed ! —i beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example.—upon my word , if this is what i am to expect , we married women must begin to exert ourselves ! —oh ! mr. weston , i could not have believed it of you ! ”
austen	emma	her father ’ s comfort was amply secured , mrs. bates as well as mrs. goddard being able to come ; and her last pleasing duty , before she left the house , was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after dinner ; and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her dress , to make the two ladies all the amends in her power , by helping them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine , for whatever unwilling self-denial his care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise during the meal.—she had provided a plentiful dinner for them ; she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it .
austen	emma	“ it appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world. ” “ and so she is to come to us next friday or saturday , and the campbells leave town in their way to holyhead the monday following—as you will find from jane ’ s letter . so sudden ! —you may guess , dear miss woodhouse , what a flurry it has thrown me in ! if it was not for the drawback of her illness—but i am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin , and looking very poorly . i must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me , as to that . i always make a point of reading jane ’ s letters through to myself first , before i read them aloud to my mother , you know , for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her . jane desired me to do it , so i always do : and so i began to-day with my usual caution ; but no sooner did i come to the mention of her being unwell , than i burst out , quite frightened , with ‘ bless me ! poor jane is ill ! ’ —which my mother , being on the watch , heard distinctly , and was sadly alarmed at . however , when i read on , i found it was not near so bad as i had fancied at first ; and i make so light of it now to her , that she does not think much about it . but i can not imagine how i could be so off my guard . if jane does not get well soon , we will call in mr. perry . the expense shall not be thought of ; and though he is so liberal , and so fond of jane that i dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance , we could not suffer it to be so , you know . he has a wife and family to maintain , and is not to be giving away his time . well , now i have just given you a hint of what jane writes about , we will turn to her letter , and i am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than i can tell it for her . ”
austen	emma	emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important service which his better sense would have rendered her , to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly follies—her wilful intimacy with harriet smith ; but it was too tender a subject.—she could not enter on it.—harriet was very seldom mentioned between them . this , on his side , might merely proceed from her not being thought of ; but emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy , and a suspicion , from some appearances , that their friendship were declining . she was aware herself , that , parting under any other circumstances , they certainly should have corresponded more , and that her intelligence would not have rested , as it now almost wholly did , on isabella ’ s letters . he might observe that it was so . the pain of being obliged to practise concealment towards him , was very little inferior to the pain of having made harriet unhappy .
austen	emma	chapter xii mr. knightley was to dine with them—rather against the inclination of mr. woodhouse , who did not like that any one should share with him in isabella ’ s first day . emma ’ s sense of right however had decided it ; and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother , she had particular pleasure , from the circumstance of the late disagreement between mr. knightley and herself , in procuring him the proper invitation .
austen	emma	“ whoever might be her parents , ” said mr. knightley , “ whoever may have had the charge of her , it does not appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society . after receiving a very indifferent education she is left in mrs. goddard ’ s hands to shift as she can ; —to move , in short , in mrs. goddard ’ s line , to have mrs. goddard ’ s acquaintance . her friends evidently thought this good enough for her ; and it _was_ good enough . she desired nothing better herself . till you chose to turn her into a friend , her mind had no distaste for her own set , nor any ambition beyond it . she was as happy as possible with the martins in the summer . she had no sense of superiority then . if she has it now , you have given it . you have been no friend to harriet smith , emma . robert martin would never have proceeded so far , if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him . i know him well . he has too much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion . and as to conceit , he is the farthest from it of any man i know . depend upon it he had encouragement . ”
austen	emma	“ your feelings are singular . they seem to satisfy every body else. ” “ i suspect they do not satisfy mrs. weston . they hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings : standing in a mother ’ s place , but without a mother ’ s affection to blind her . it is on her account that attention to randalls is doubly due , and she must doubly feel the omission . had she been a person of consequence herself , he would have come i dare say ; and it would not have signified whether he did or no . can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations ? do you suppose she does not often say all this to herself ? no , emma , your amiable young man can be amiable only in french , not in english . he may be very ‘ amiable , ’ have very good manners , and be very agreeable ; but he can have no english delicacy towards the feelings of other people : nothing really amiable about him . ”
austen	emma	“ yes , she would be , but that she thinks there will be another put-off . she does not depend upon his coming so much as i do : but she does not know the parties so well as i do . the case , you see , is— ( but this is quite between ourselves : i did not mention a syllable of it in the other room . there are secrets in all families , you know ) —the case is , that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at enscombe in january ; and that frank ’ s coming depends upon their being put off . if they are not put off , he can not stir . but i know they will , because it is a family that a certain lady , of some consequence , at enscombe , has a particular dislike to : and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or three years , they always are put off when it comes to the point . i have not the smallest doubt of the issue . i am as confident of seeing frank here before the middle of january , as i am of being here myself : but your good friend there ( nodding towards the upper end of the table ) has so few vagaries herself , and has been so little used to them at hartfield , that she can not calculate on their effects , as i have been long in the practice of doing . ”
austen	emma	it was , indeed , a highly prized letter . mrs. weston had , of course , formed a very favourable idea of the young man ; and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense , and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured . she felt herself a most fortunate woman ; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought , where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled , and who could ill bear to part with her .
austen	emma	“ it will not do , ” whispered frank to emma ; “ they are most of them affronted . i will attack them with more address . ladies and gentlemen—i am ordered by miss woodhouse to say , that she waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of , and only requires something very entertaining from each of you , in a general way . here are seven of you , besides myself , ( who , she is pleased to say , am very entertaining already , ) and she only demands from each of you either one thing very clever , be it prose or verse , original or repeated—or two things moderately clever—or three things very dull indeed , and she engages to laugh heartily at them all . ”
austen	emma	“ our amiable young man is a very weak young man , if this be the first occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the will of others . it ought to have been a habit with him by this time , of following his duty , instead of consulting expediency . i can allow for the fears of the child , but not of the man . as he became rational , he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority . he ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father . had he begun as he ought , there would have been no difficulty now . ”
austen	emma	jane was forced to smile completely , for a moment ; and the smile partly remained as she turned towards him , and said in a conscious , low , yet steady voice , “ how you can bear such recollections , is astonishing to me ! —they _will_ sometimes obtrude—but how you can court them ! ”
austen	emma	“ my mother ’ s deafness is very trifling you see—just nothing at all . by only raising my voice , and saying any thing two or three times over , she is sure to hear ; but then she is used to my voice . but it is very remarkable that she should always hear jane better than she does me . jane speaks so distinct ! however , she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago ; which is saying a great deal at my mother ’ s time of life—and it really is full two years , you know , since she was here . we never were so long without seeing her before , and as i was telling mrs. cole , we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now . ”
austen	emma	chapter xiii there could hardly be a happier creature in the world than mrs. john knightley , in this short visit to hartfield , going about every morning among her old acquaintance with her five children , and talking over what she had done every evening with her father and sister . she had nothing to wish otherwise , but that the days did not pass so swiftly . it was a delightful visit ; —perfect , in being much too short .
austen	emma	he was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law . nothing wrong in him escaped her . she was quick in feeling the little injuries to isabella , which isabella never felt herself . perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been flattering to isabella ’ s sister , but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend , without praise and without blindness ; but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into , the want of respectful forbearance towards her father . there he had not always the patience that could have been wished . mr. woodhouse ’ s peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill-bestowed . it did not often happen ; for mr. john knightley had really a great regard for his father-in-law , and generally a strong sense of what was due to him ; but it was too often for emma ’ s charity , especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured , though the offence came not . the beginning , however , of every visit displayed none but the properest feelings , and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality . they had not been long seated and composed when mr. woodhouse , with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh , called his daughter ’ s attention to the sad change at hartfield since she had been there last .
austen	emma	of the lady , individually , emma thought very little . she was good enough for mr. elton , no doubt ; accomplished enough for highbury—handsome enough—to look plain , probably , by harriet ’ s side . as to connexion , there emma was perfectly easy ; persuaded , that after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of harriet , he had done nothing . on that article , truth seemed attainable . _what_ she was , must be uncertain ; but _who_ she was , might be found out ; and setting aside the 10,000 l. , it did not appear that she was at all harriet ’ s superior . she brought no name , no blood , no alliance . miss hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a bristol—merchant , of course , he must be called ; but , as the whole of the profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate , it was not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very moderate also . part of every winter she had been used to spend in bath ; but bristol was her home , the very heart of bristol ; for though the father and mother had died some years ago , an uncle remained—in the law line—nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him , than that he was in the law line ; and with him the daughter had lived . emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney , and too stupid to rise . and all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder sister , who was _very_ _well_ _married_ , to a gentleman in a _great_ _way_ , near bristol , who kept two carriages ! that was the wind-up of the history ; that was the glory of miss hawkins .
austen	emma	“ she is a sort of elegant creature that one can not keep one ’ s eyes from . i am always watching her to admire ; and i do pity her from my heart. ” mr. knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to express ; and before he could make any reply , mr. woodhouse , whose thoughts were on the bates ’ s , said—
austen	emma	“ you will soon be cooler , if you sit still , ” said emma . “ as soon as i am cooler i shall go back again . i could very ill be spared—but such a point had been made of my coming ! you will all be going soon i suppose ; the whole party breaking up . i met _one_ as i came—madness in such weather ! —absolute madness ! ”
austen	emma	he stopped in his earnestness to look the question , and the expression of his eyes overpowered her . “ my dearest emma , ” said he , “ for dearest you will always be , whatever the event of this hour ’ s conversation , my dearest , most beloved emma—tell me at once . say ‘ no , ’ if it is to be said. ” —she could really say nothing.— “ you are silent , ” he cried , with great animation ; “ absolutely silent ! at present i ask no more . ”
austen	emma	the ladies had not been long in the drawing-room , before the other ladies , in their different divisions , arrived . emma watched the entree of her own particular little friend ; and if she could not exult in her dignity and grace , she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the artless manner , but could most heartily rejoice in that light , cheerful , unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations of pleasure , in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection . there she sat—and who would have guessed how many tears she had been lately shedding ? to be in company , nicely dressed herself and seeing others nicely dressed , to sit and smile and look pretty , and say nothing , was enough for the happiness of the present hour . jane fairfax did look and move superior ; but emma suspected she might have been glad to change feelings with harriet , very glad to have purchased the mortification of having loved—yes , of having loved even mr. elton in vain—by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend .
austen	emma	“ indeed , harriet , it would have been a severe pang to lose you ; but it must have been . you would have thrown yourself out of all good society . i must have given you up . ”
austen	emma	“ between mr. frank churchill and miss fairfax ? oh ! yes , perfectly.—why do you make a doubt of it ? ” “ have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her , or that she admired him ? ”
austen	emma	at this moment they were approaching ford ’ s , and he hastily exclaimed , “ ha ! this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of their lives , as my father informs me . he comes to highbury himself , he says , six days out of the seven , and has always business at ford ’ s . if it be not inconvenient to you , pray let us go in , that i may prove myself to belong to the place , to be a true citizen of highbury . i must buy something at ford ’ s . it will be taking out my freedom.—i dare say they sell gloves . ”
austen	emma	“ miss fairfax ’ s compliments and thanks , but is quite unequal to any exercise. ” emma felt that her own note had deserved something better ; but it was impossible to quarrel with words , whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly , and she thought only of how she might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted . in spite of the answer , therefore , she ordered the carriage , and drove to mrs. bates ’ s , in the hope that jane would be induced to join her—but it would not do ; —miss bates came to the carriage door , all gratitude , and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest service—and every thing that message could do was tried—but all in vain . miss bates was obliged to return without success ; jane was quite unpersuadable ; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse.—emma wished she could have seen her , and tried her own powers ; but , almost before she could hint the wish , miss bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let miss woodhouse in . “ indeed , the truth was , that poor dear jane could not bear to see any body—any body at all—mrs . elton , indeed , could not be denied—and mrs. cole had made such a point—and mrs. perry had said so much—but , except them , jane would really see nobody . ”
austen	emma	“ i often feel concern , ” said she , “ that i dare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions . it is not that i am without the wish ; but you know how impossible my father would deem it that james should put-to for such a purpose . ”
austen	emma	every invitation was successful . they were all disengaged and all happy.—the preparatory interest of this dinner , however , was not yet over . a circumstance rather unlucky occurred . the two eldest little knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some weeks in the spring , and their papa now proposed bringing them , and staying one whole day at hartfield—which one day would be the very day of this party.—his professional engagements did not allow of his being put off , but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening so . mr. woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bear—and here would be a ninth—and emma apprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even to hartfield for forty-eight hours without falling in with a dinner-party .
austen	emma	emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost ; and all that was amiable , all that ought to be attaching , seemed on harriet ’ s side , not her own . harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of . the affection of such a man as mr. elton would have been too great a distinction.—she never could have deserved him—and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as miss woodhouse would have thought it possible .
austen	emma	emma could not suppose any such thing , knowing as she did , that both the mr. knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself ; —and two basins only were ordered . after a little more discourse in praise of gruel , with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every body , he proceeded to say , with an air of grave reflection ,
austen	emma	it did , however.—her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden a journey , and his fears that mr. elton might never get safely to the end of it , and saw nothing extraordinary in his language . it was a very useful note , for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening . mr. woodhouse talked over his alarms , and emma was in spirits to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude .
austen	emma	emma made as slight a reply as she could ; but it was fully sufficient for mrs. elton , who only wanted to be talking herself . “ so extremely like maple grove ! and it is not merely the house—the grounds , i assure you , as far as i could observe , are strikingly like . the laurels at maple grove are in the same profusion as here , and stand very much in the same way—just across the lawn ; and i had a glimpse of a fine large tree , with a bench round it , which put me so exactly in mind ! my brother and sister will be enchanted with this place . people who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style . ”
austen	emma	such was jane fairfax ’ s history . she had fallen into good hands , known nothing but kindness from the campbells , and been given an excellent education . living constantly with right-minded and well-informed people , her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture ; and colonel campbell ’ s residence being in london , every lighter talent had been done full justice to , by the attendance of first-rate masters . her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do ; and at eighteen or nineteen she was , as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children , fully competent to the office of instruction herself ; but she was too much beloved to be parted with . neither father nor mother could promote , and the daughter could not endure it . the evil day was put off . it was easy to decide that she was still too young ; and jane remained with them , sharing , as another daughter , in all the rational pleasures of an elegant society , and a judicious mixture of home and amusement , with only the drawback of the future , the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over .
austen	emma	“ oh ! yes , very . nobody cares for a letter ; the thing is , to be always happy with pleasant companions . i am quite determined to refuse him . but how shall i do ? what shall i say ? ”
austen	emma	“ and if you find them troublesome , you must send them home again. ” “ that is very likely . you think so , do not you ? ” “ i hope i am aware that they may be too noisy for your father—or even may be some encumbrance to you , if your visiting engagements continue to increase as much as they have done lately . ”
austen	emma	“ yes , he has been gone just four weeks , as you observe , miss woodhouse , ” said miss bates , “ four weeks yesterday.—a miss hawkins ! —well , i had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts ; not that i ever—mrs . cole once whispered to me—but i immediately said , ‘ no , mr. elton is a most worthy young man—but ’ —in short , i do not think i am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries . i do not pretend to it . what is before me , i see . at the same time , nobody could wonder if mr. elton should have aspired—miss woodhouse lets me chatter on , so good-humouredly . she knows i would not offend for the world . how does miss smith do ? she seems quite recovered now . have you heard from mrs. john knightley lately ? oh ! those dear little children . jane , do you know i always fancy mr. dixon like mr. john knightley . i mean in person—tall , and with that sort of look—and not very talkative . ”
austen	emma	“ a house of her own ! —but where is the advantage of a house of her own ? this is three times as large.—and you have never any odd humours , my dear. ” “ how often we shall be going to see them , and they coming to see us ! —we shall be always meeting ! _we_ must begin ; we must go and pay wedding visit very soon . ”
austen	emma	“ emma , ” said mr. knightley presently , “ i have a piece of news for you . you like news—and i heard an article in my way hither that i think will interest you . ”
austen	emma	“ can you trust me with such flatterers ? —does my vain spirit ever tell me i am wrong ? ” “ not your vain spirit , but your serious spirit.—if one leads you wrong , i am sure the other tells you of it . ”
austen	emma	harriet , who had been standing in no unhappy reverie , was yet very glad to be called from it , by the now encouraging manner of such a judge , and such a friend as miss woodhouse , and only wanted invitation , to give the history of her hopes with great , though trembling delight.—emma ’ s tremblings as she asked , and as she listened , were better concealed than harriet ’ s , but they were not less . her voice was not unsteady ; but her mind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self , such a burst of threatening evil , such a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions , must create.—she listened with much inward suffering , but with great outward patience , to harriet ’ s detail.—methodical , or well arranged , or very well delivered , it could not be expected to be ; but it contained , when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of the narration , a substance to sink her spirit—especially with the corroborating circumstances , which her own memory brought in favour of mr. knightley ’ s most improved opinion of harriet .
austen	emma	after much thinking , she could determine on nothing better , than harriet ’ s returning the visit ; but in a way that , if they had understanding , should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance . she meant to take her in the carriage , leave her at the abbey mill , while she drove a little farther , and call for her again so soon , as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past , and give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future .
austen	emma	“ such an extraordinary dream of mine ! ” he cried . “ i can never think of it without laughing.—she hears us , she hears us , miss woodhouse . i see it in her cheek , her smile , her vain attempt to frown . look at her . do not you see that , at this instant , the very passage of her own letter , which sent me the report , is passing under her eye—that the whole blunder is spread before her—that she can attend to nothing else , though pretending to listen to the others ? ”
austen	emma	“ i went only to the post-office , ” said she , “ and reached home before the rain was much . it is my daily errand . i always fetch the letters when i am here . it saves trouble , and is a something to get me out . a walk before breakfast does me good . ”
austen	emma	harriet , mr. elton , and mr. knightley , their own especial set , were the only persons invited to meet them ; —the hours were to be early , as well as the numbers few ; mr. woodhouse ’ s habits and inclination being consulted in every thing .
austen	emma	he was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter ; to escape a little from the latter , he went to the pianoforte , and begged miss fairfax , who was still sitting at it , to play something more .
austen	emma	emma found it really time to be at home ; the visit had already lasted long ; and on examining watches , so much of the morning was perceived to be gone , that mrs. weston and her companion taking leave also , could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to hartfield gates , before they set off for randalls .
austen	emma	they were entering the hall . mr. knightley ’ s eyes had preceded miss bates ’ s in a glance at jane . from frank churchill ’ s face , where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away , he had involuntarily turned to hers ; but she was indeed behind , and too busy with her shawl . mr. weston had walked in . the two other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass . mr. knightley suspected in frank churchill the determination of catching her eye—he seemed watching her intently—in vain , however , if it were so—jane passed between them into the hall , and looked at neither .
austen	emma	“ you think her diffident . i do not see it. ” “ my dear emma , ” said he , moving from his chair into one close by her , “ you are not going to tell me , i hope , that you had not a pleasant evening . ”
austen	emma	before the middle of the next day , he was at hartfield ; and he entered the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of the scheme . it soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement .
austen	emma	“ of all horrid things , leave-taking is the worst. ” “ but you will come again , ” said emma . “ this will not be your only visit to randalls. ” “ ah ! — ( shaking his head ) —the uncertainty of when i may be able to return ! —i shall try for it with a zeal ! —it will be the object of all my thoughts and cares ! —and if my uncle and aunt go to town this spring—but i am afraid—they did not stir last spring—i am afraid it is a custom gone for ever . ”
austen	emma	the lovers were standing together at one of the windows . it had a most favourable aspect ; and , for half a minute , emma felt the glory of having schemed successfully . but it would not do ; he had not come to the point . he had been most agreeable , most delightful ; he had told harriet that he had seen them go by , and had purposely followed them ; other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt , but nothing serious .
austen	emma	as she thought less of his inebriety , she thought more of his inconstancy and presumption ; and with fewer struggles for politeness , replied , “ it is impossible for me to doubt any longer . you have made yourself too clear . mr. elton , my astonishment is much beyond any thing i can express . after such behaviour , as i have witnessed during the last month , to miss smith—such attentions as i have been in the daily habit of observing—to be addressing me in this manner—this is an unsteadiness of character , indeed , which i had not supposed possible ! believe me , sir , i am far , very far , from gratified in being the object of such professions . ”
austen	emma	mr. elton ’ s rights , however , gradually revived . though she did not feel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before , or an hour before , its interest soon increased ; and before their first conversation was over , she had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity , wonder and regret , pain and pleasure , as to this fortunate miss hawkins , which could conduce to place the martins under proper subordination in her fancy .
austen	emma	“ i rather doubt that . you are very fond of bending little minds ; but where little minds belong to rich people in authority , i think they have a knack of swelling out , till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones . i can imagine , that if you , as you are , mr. knightley , were to be transported and placed all at once in mr. frank churchill ’ s situation , you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him ; and it might have a very good effect . the churchills might not have a word to say in return ; but then , you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through . to him who has , it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence , and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought . he may have as strong a sense of what would be right , as you can have , without being so equal , under particular circumstances , to act up to it . ”
austen	emma	“ you understand the force of influence pretty well , harriet ; but i would have you so firmly established in good society , as to be independent even of hartfield and miss woodhouse . i want to see you permanently well connected , and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be ; and , therefore , i say that if you should still be in this country when mr. martin marries , i wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters , to be acquainted with the wife , who will probably be some mere farmer ’ s daughter , without education . ”
austen	emma	“ yes . but what shall i say ? dear miss woodhouse , do advise me. ” “ oh no , no ! the letter had much better be all your own . you will express yourself very properly , i am sure . there is no danger of your not being intelligible , which is the first thing . your meaning must be unequivocal ; no doubts or demurs : and such expressions of gratitude and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires , will present themselves unbidden to _your_ mind , i am persuaded . you need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment . ”
austen	emma	“ he is very plain , undoubtedly—remarkably plain : —but that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility . i had no right to expect much , and i did not expect much ; but i had no idea that he could be so very clownish , so totally without air . i had imagined him , i confess , a degree or two nearer gentility . ”
austen	emma	it was well to have a comfort in store on harriet ’ s behalf , though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom ; for evil in that quarter was at hand . as frank churchill ’ s arrival had succeeded mr. elton ’ s engagement in the conversation of highbury , as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first , so now upon frank churchill ’ s disappearance , mr. elton ’ s concerns were assuming the most irresistible form.—his wedding-day was named . he would soon be among them again ; mr. elton and his bride . there was hardly time to talk over the first letter from enscombe before “ mr . elton and his bride ” was in every body ’ s mouth , and frank churchill was forgotten . emma grew sick at the sound . she had had three weeks of happy exemption from mr. elton ; and harriet ’ s mind , she had been willing to hope , had been lately gaining strength . with mr. weston ’ s ball in view at least , there had been a great deal of insensibility to other things ; but it was now too evident that she had not attained such a state of composure as could stand against the actual approach—new carriage , bell-ringing , and all .
austen	emma	“ such a home , indeed ! such an aunt ! ” said emma , as she turned back into the hall again . “ i do pity you . and the more sensibility you betray of their just horrors , the more i shall like you . ”
austen	emma	the affection of the whole family , the warm attachment of miss campbell in particular , was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of jane ’ s decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements . that nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman , nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents . they continued together with unabated regard however , till the marriage of miss campbell , who by that chance , that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs , giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior , engaged the affections of mr. dixon , a young man , rich and agreeable , almost as soon as they were acquainted ; and was eligibly and happily settled , while jane fairfax had yet her bread to earn .
austen	emma	the varieties of handwriting were farther talked of , and the usual observations made . “ i have heard it asserted , ” said john knightley , “ that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family ; and where the same master teaches , it is natural enough . but for that reason , i should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females , for boys have very little teaching after an early age , and scramble into any hand they can get . isabella and emma , i think , do write very much alike . i have not always known their writing apart . ”
austen	emma	mr. weston , however , too eager to be very observant , too communicative to want others to talk , was very well satisfied with what she did say , and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial communication of what the whole room must have overheard already .
austen	emma	“ and make her like myself. ” “ by all means , if you can. ” “ very well . i undertake the commission . you shall have a charming wife. ” “ she must be very lively , and have hazle eyes . i care for nothing else . i shall go abroad for a couple of years—and when i return , i shall come to you for my wife . remember . ”
austen	emma	when the visit was returned , emma made up her mind . she could then see more and judge better . from harriet ’ s happening not to be at hartfield , and her father ’ s being present to engage mr. elton , she had a quarter of an hour of the lady ’ s conversation to herself , and could composedly attend to her ; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that mrs. elton was a vain woman , extremely well satisfied with herself , and thinking much of her own importance ; that she meant to shine and be very superior , but with manners which had been formed in a bad school , pert and familiar ; that all her notions were drawn from one set of people , and one style of living ; that if not foolish she was ignorant , and that her society would certainly do mr. elton no good .
austen	emma	“ not quite , ” returned emma , with forced calmness , “ for all that you then said , appeared to me to relate to a different person . i could almost assert that you had _named_ mr. frank churchill . i am sure the service mr. frank churchill had rendered you , in protecting you from the gipsies , was spoken of . ”
austen	emma	“ yes , mr. dixon and miss campbell were the persons ; and i thought it a very strong proof. ” “ certainly—very strong it was ; to own the truth , a great deal stronger than , if _i_ had been miss campbell , would have been at all agreeable to me . i could not excuse a man ’ s having more music than love—more ear than eye—a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings . how did miss campbell appear to like it ? ”
austen	emma	emma thanked him , but could not allow of his disappointing his friend on their account ; her father was sure of his rubber . he re-urged—she re-declined ; and he seemed then about to make his bow , when taking the paper from the table , she returned it—
austen	emma	chapter x one morning , about ten days after mrs. churchill ’ s decease , emma was called downstairs to mr. weston , who “ could not stay five minutes , and wanted particularly to speak with her. ” —he met her at the parlour-door , and hardly asking her how she did , in the natural key of his voice , sunk it immediately , to say , unheard by her father ,
austen	emma	the evening before this great event ( for it was a very great event that mr. woodhouse should dine out , on the 24th of december ) had been spent by harriet at hartfield , and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold , that , but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by mrs. goddard , emma could not have allowed her to leave the house . emma called on her the next day , and found her doom already signed with regard to randalls . she was very feverish and had a bad sore throat : mrs. goddard was full of care and affection , mr. perry was talked of , and harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement , though she could not speak of her loss without many tears .
austen	emma	no objection was raised on the father ’ s side ; the young man was treated liberally ; it was all as it should be : and as emma became acquainted with robert martin , who was now introduced at hartfield , she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could bid fairest for her little friend . she had no doubt of harriet ’ s happiness with any good-tempered man ; but with him , and in the home he offered , there would be the hope of more , of security , stability , and improvement . she would be placed in the midst of those who loved her , and who had better sense than herself ; retired enough for safety , and occupied enough for cheerfulness . she would be never led into temptation , nor left for it to find her out . she would be respectable and happy ; and emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the world , to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a man ; —or , if not quite the luckiest , to yield only to herself .
austen	emma	he paused . she could not but hear ; she could not avoid answering , “ till i have a letter from colonel campbell , ” said she , in a voice of forced calmness , “ i can imagine nothing with any confidence . it must be all conjecture . ”
austen	emma	mr. woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit , that in spite of the increasing coldness , he seemed to have no idea of shrinking from it , and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest daughter in his own carriage , with less apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the others ; too full of the wonder of his own going , and the pleasure it was to afford at randalls to see that it was cold , and too well wrapt up to feel it . the cold , however , was severe ; and by the time the second carriage was in motion , a few flakes of snow were finding their way down , and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time .
austen	emma	when they all sat down it was better ; to her taste a great deal better , for frank churchill grew talkative and gay , making her his first object . every distinguishing attention that could be paid , was paid to her . to amuse her , and be agreeable in her eyes , seemed all that he cared for—and emma , glad to be enlivened , not sorry to be flattered , was gay and easy too , and gave him all the friendly encouragement , the admission to be gallant , which she had ever given in the first and most animating period of their acquaintance ; but which now , in her own estimation , meant nothing , though in the judgment of most people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no english word but flirtation could very well describe . “ mr . frank churchill and miss woodhouse flirted together excessively. ” they were laying themselves open to that very phrase—and to having it sent off in a letter to maple grove by one lady , to ireland by another . not that emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity ; it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected . she laughed because she was disappointed ; and though she liked him for his attentions , and thought them all , whether in friendship , admiration , or playfulness , extremely judicious , they were not winning back her heart . she still intended him for her friend .
austen	emma	“ then pray stay at richmond. ” “ but if i do , i shall be crosser still . i can never bear to think of you all there without me. ” “ these are difficulties which you must settle for yourself . chuse your own degree of crossness . i shall press you no more . ”
austen	emma	“ i do not think it _is_ so very small . we shall not be many , you know. ” and mr. weston at the same time , walking briskly with long steps through the passage , was calling out ,
austen	emma	“ jane caught a bad cold , poor thing ! so long ago as the 7th of november , ( as i am going to read to you , ) and has never been well since . a long time , is not it , for a cold to hang upon her ? she never mentioned it before , because she would not alarm us . just like her ! so considerate ! —but however , she is so far from well , that her kind friends the campbells think she had better come home , and try an air that always agrees with her ; and they have no doubt that three or four months at highbury will entirely cure her—and it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here , than go to ireland , if she is unwell . nobody could nurse her , as we should do . ”
austen	emma	“ no , i do not know that mr. wingfield considers it _very_ sickly except— “ ah ! my poor dear child , the truth is , that in london it is always a sickly season . nobody is healthy in london , nobody can be . it is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there ! so far off ! —and the air so bad ! ”
austen	emma	“ but you do not consider how it may appear to the coles . emma ’ s going away directly after tea might be giving offence . they are good-natured people , and think little of their own claims ; but still they must feel that any body ’ s hurrying away is no great compliment ; and miss woodhouse ’ s doing it would be more thought of than any other person ’ s in the room . you would not wish to disappoint and mortify the coles , i am sure , sir ; friendly , good sort of people as ever lived , and who have been your neighbours these _ten_ years . ”
austen	emma	“ but , unfortunately , sir , my time is so limited— ” “ oh ! ” interrupted emma , “ there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over . there is no hurry at all . if it can be contrived to be at the crown , papa , it will be very convenient for the horses . they will be so near their own stable . ”
austen	emma	“ say nothing , my dear emma , while you oblige me to read—not even of mrs. elton . only one page more . i shall soon have done . what a letter the man writes ! ”
austen	emma	“ but , harriet , is it necessary to burn the court-plaister ? —i have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil , but the court-plaister might be useful. ” “ i shall be happier to burn it , ” replied harriet . “ it has a disagreeable look to me . i must get rid of every thing.—there it goes , and there is an end , thank heaven ! of mr. elton . ”
austen	emma	she opened the parlour door , and saw two gentlemen sitting with her father—mr . weston and his son . they had been arrived only a few minutes , and mr. weston had scarcely finished his explanation of frank ’ s being a day before his time , and her father was yet in the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations , when she appeared , to have her share of surprize , introduction , and pleasure .
austen	emma	at first it was downright dulness to emma . she had never seen frank churchill so silent and stupid . he said nothing worth hearing—looked without seeing—admired without intelligence—listened without knowing what she said . while he was so dull , it was no wonder that harriet should be dull likewise ; and they were both insufferable .
austen	emma	a carriage was heard . he was on the move immediately ; but coming back , said , “ i am forgetting that i am not acquainted with her . i have never seen either mr. or mrs. elton . i have no business to put myself forward . ”
austen	emma	“ you do quite right , ” said she ; — “ we will make your apologies to mr. and mrs. weston. ” but hardly had she so spoken , when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage , if the weather were mr. elton ’ s only objection , and mr. elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction . it was a done thing ; mr. elton was to go , and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment ; never had his smile been stronger , nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her .
austen	emma	their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance . on his side were the inquiries , — “ was she a horsewoman ? —pleasant rides ? —pleasant walks ? —had they a large neighbourhood ? —highbury , perhaps , afforded society enough ? —there were several very pretty houses in and about it.—balls—had they balls ? —was it a musical society ? ”
austen	emma	emma was more than half in hopes of mr. elton ’ s having dropt a hint . mr. knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser , and she knew mr. elton looked up to him .
austen	emma	“ there does , indeed , seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present , ” said mrs. weston , “ as can well be ; and while she is so happy at hartfield , i can not wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor mr. woodhouse ’ s account . i do not recommend matrimony at present to emma , though i mean no slight to the state , i assure you . ”
austen	emma	the rest of the day , the following night , were hardly enough for her thoughts.—she was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had rushed on her within the last few hours . every moment had brought a fresh surprize ; and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to her.—how to understand it all ! how to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising on herself , and living under ! —the blunders , the blindness of her own head and heart ! —she sat still , she walked about , she tried her own room , she tried the shrubbery—in every place , every posture , she perceived that she had acted most weakly ; that she had been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree ; that she had been imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying ; that she was wretched , and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness .
austen	emma	to isabella , the relief of such tidings was very great , and they were scarcely less acceptable to emma on her father ’ s account , who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution allowed ; but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at randalls . he was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning home , but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay ; and while the others were variously urging and recommending , mr. knightley and emma settled it in a few brief sentences : thus—
austen	emma	and not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded . she regained the street—happy in this , that though much had been forced on her against her will , though she had in fact heard the whole substance of jane fairfax ’ s letter , she had been able to escape the letter itself .
austen	emma	“ it is so , indeed , ” continued mr. knightley ; “ i have it from robert martin himself . he left me not half an hour ago. ” she was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement .
austen	emma	“ miss woodhouse—if you are at leisure—i have something that i should like to tell you—a sort of confession to make—and then , you know , it will be over. ” emma was a good deal surprized ; but begged her to speak . there was a seriousness in harriet ’ s manner which prepared her , quite as much as her words , for something more than ordinary .
austen	emma	“ i wish we had a donkey . the thing would be for us all to come on donkeys , jane , miss bates , and me—and my caro sposo walking by . i really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey . in a country life i conceive it to be a sort of necessary ; for , let a woman have ever so many resources , it is not possible for her to be always shut up at home ; —and very long walks , you know—in summer there is dust , and in winter there is dirt . ”
austen	emma	“ if i had not persuaded harriet into liking the man , i could have borne any thing . he might have doubled his presumption to me—but poor harriet ! ” how she could have been so deceived ! —he protested that he had never thought seriously of harriet—never ! she looked back as well as she could ; but it was all confusion . she had taken up the idea , she supposed , and made every thing bend to it . his manners , however , must have been unmarked , wavering , dubious , or she could not have been so misled .
austen	emma	she was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations , which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length , by the eagerness of harriet ’ s wondering questions . “ what can it be , miss woodhouse ? —what can it be ? i have not an idea—i can not guess it in the least . what can it possibly be ? do try to find it out , miss woodhouse . do help me . i never saw any thing so hard . is it kingdom ? i wonder who the friend was—and who could be the young lady . do you think it is a good one ? can it be woman ?
austen	emma	“ my dear sir , upon no account in the world ; my father can direct me. ” “ but your father is not going so far ; he is only going to the crown , quite on the other side of the street , and there are a great many houses ; you might be very much at a loss , and it is a very dirty walk , unless you keep on the footpath ; but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street . ”
austen	emma	while they were thus comfortably occupied , mr. woodhouse was enjoying a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter . “ my poor dear isabella , ” said he , fondly taking her hand , and interrupting , for a few moments , her busy labours for some one of her five children— “ how long it is , how terribly long since you were here ! and how tired you must be after your journey ! you must go to bed early , my dear—and i recommend a little gruel to you before you go.—you and i will have a nice basin of gruel together . my dear emma , suppose we all have a little gruel . ”
austen	emma	“ my dear papa , i sent the whole hind-quarter . i knew you would wish it . there will be the leg to be salted , you know , which is so very nice , and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like . ”
austen	emma	“ you , emma , who have so few opportunities of dancing , you are really out of luck ; you are very much out of luck ! ” it was some days before she saw jane fairfax , to judge of her honest regret in this woeful change ; but when they did meet , her composure was odious . she had been particularly unwell , however , suffering from headache to a degree , which made her aunt declare , that had the ball taken place , she did not think jane could have attended it ; and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of ill-health .
austen	emma	emma spoke her pity so very kindly , that with a sudden accession of gay thought , he cried , “ ah ! by the bye , ” then sinking his voice , and looking demure for the moment— “ i hope mr. knightley is well ? ” he paused.—she coloured and laughed.— “ i know you saw my letter , and think you may remember my wish in your favour . let me return your congratulations.—i assure you that i have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction.—he is a man whom i can not presume to praise . ”
austen	emma	“ yes , to be sure , i suppose there are . but while i visit at hartfield , and you are so kind to me , miss woodhouse , i am not afraid of what any body can do . ”
austen	emma	he did , on the condition of some promises on her side : such as that , if she came home cold , she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly ; if hungry , that she would take something to eat ; that her own maid should sit up for her ; and that serle and the butler should see that every thing were safe in the house , as usual .
austen	emma	it was , indeed , so odd ; harriet ’ s behaviour was so extremely odd , that emma did not know how to understand it . her character appeared absolutely changed . she seemed to propose shewing no agitation , or disappointment , or peculiar concern in the discovery . emma looked at her , quite unable to speak .
austen	emma	“ i shall not give you any advice , harriet . i will have nothing to do with it . this is a point which you must settle with your feelings. ” “ i had no notion that he liked me so very much , ” said harriet , contemplating the letter . for a little while emma persevered in her silence ; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter might be too powerful , she thought it best to say ,
austen	emma	chapter iii emma could not forgive her ; —but as neither provocation nor resentment were discerned by mr. knightley , who had been of the party , and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side , he was expressing the next morning , being at hartfield again on business with mr. woodhouse , his approbation of the whole ; not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room , but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to emma . he had been used to think her unjust to jane , and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement .
austen	emma	chapter xiv what totally different feelings did emma take back into the house from what she had brought out ! —she had then been only daring to hope for a little respite of suffering ; —she was now in an exquisite flutter of happiness , and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away .
austen	emma	to guess what all this meant , was impossible even for emma . something really important seemed announced by his looks ; but , as her friend was well , she endeavoured not to be uneasy , and settling it with her father , that she would take her walk now , she and mr. weston were soon out of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for randalls .
austen	emma	she had no doubt of what mr. weston was often thinking about . his quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy expression ; and even , when he might have determined not to look , she was confident that he was often listening .
austen	emma	“ and have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess ? —i pity you.—i thought you cleverer—for , depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck . there is always some talent in it . and as to my poor word ‘ success , ’ which you quarrel with , i do not know that i am so entirely without any claim to it . you have drawn two pretty pictures ; but i think there may be a third—a something between the do-nothing and the do-all . if i had not promoted mr. weston ’ s visits here , and given many little encouragements , and smoothed many little matters , it might not have come to any thing after all . i think you must know hartfield enough to comprehend that . ”
austen	emma	the word _home_ made his father look on him with fresh complacency . emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable ; the conviction was strengthened by what followed . he was very much pleased with randalls , thought it a most admirably arranged house , would hardly allow it even to be very small , admired the situation , the walk to highbury , highbury itself , hartfield still more , and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but one ’ s _own_ country gives , and the greatest curiosity to visit it . that he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before , passed suspiciously through emma ’ s brain ; but still , if it were a falsehood , it was a pleasant one , and pleasantly handled . his manner had no air of study or exaggeration . he did really look and speak as if in a state of no common enjoyment .
austen	emma	“ oh ! no ; i was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions ; and amused to think how little information i obtained. ” “ i am disappointed , ” was his only answer . “ i hope every body had a pleasant evening , ” said mr. woodhouse , in his quiet way . “ i had . once , i felt the fire rather too much ; but then i moved back my chair a little , a very little , and it did not disturb me . miss bates was very chatty and good-humoured , as she always is , though she speaks rather too quick . however , she is very agreeable , and mrs. bates too , in a different way . i like old friends ; and miss jane fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady , a very pretty and a very well-behaved young lady indeed . she must have found the evening agreeable , mr. knightley , because she had emma . ”
austen	emma	he had reached randalls the evening before . she was pleased with the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan , and travel earlier , later , and quicker , that he might gain half a day .
austen	emma	“ but then , to be an old maid at last , like miss bates ! ” “ that is as formidable an image as you could present , harriet ; and if i thought i should ever be like miss bates ! so silly—so satisfied—so smiling—so prosing—so undistinguishing and unfastidious—and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me , i would marry to-morrow . but between _us_ , i am convinced there never can be any likeness , except in being unmarried . ”
austen	emma	“ they are blended , ” said he , “ i acknowledge ; and , were she prosperous , i could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good . were she a woman of fortune , i would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance , i would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner . were she your equal in situation—but , emma , consider how far this is from being the case . she is poor ; she has sunk from the comforts she was born to ; and , if she live to old age , must probably sink more . her situation should secure your compassion . it was badly done , indeed ! you , whom she had known from an infant , whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour , to have you now , in thoughtless spirits , and the pride of the moment , laugh at her , humble her—and before her niece , too—and before others , many of whom ( certainly _some_ , ) would be entirely guided by _your_ treatment of her.—this is not pleasant to you , emma—and it is very far from pleasant to me ; but i must , i will , —i will tell you truths while i can ; satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel , and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now . ”
austen	emma	he contrived that she should be seated by him ; and was sufficiently employed in looking out the best baked apple for her , and trying to make her help or advise him in his work , till jane fairfax was quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again . that she was not immediately ready , emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves ; she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion ; she must reason herself into the power of performance ; and emma could not but pity such feelings , whatever their origin , and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again .
austen	emma	such , for half an hour , was the conversation—interrupted only once by mrs. weston , who came out , in her solicitude after her son-in-law , to inquire if he were come—and she was a little uneasy.—she had some fears of his horse .
austen	emma	“ yes , frank came over this morning , just to ask us how we did. ” they hurried on , and were speedily at randalls.— “ well , my dear , ” said he , as they entered the room— “ i have brought her , and now i hope you will soon be better . i shall leave you together . there is no use in delay . i shall not be far off , if you want me. ” —and emma distinctly heard him add , in a lower tone , before he quitted the room , — “ i have been as good as my word . she has not the least idea . ”
austen	emma	mr. elton was to take the drawing to london , chuse the frame , and give the directions ; and emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him , while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough .
austen	emma	emma had not had time even to think of mr. elton , and she was so completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start , and a little blush , at the sound .
austen	emma	mr. knightley was fortunate in every body ’ s most ready concurrence . the invitation was everywhere so well received , that it seemed as if , like mrs. elton , they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves.—emma and harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it ; and mr. weston , unasked , promised to get frank over to join them , if possible ; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with.—mr . knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad to see him ; and mr. weston engaged to lose no time in writing , and spare no arguments to induce him to come .
austen	emma	“ but , my dear sir , the difference of the journey ; —only consider how great it would have been.—an hundred miles , perhaps , instead of forty. ” “ ah ! my dear , as perry says , where health is at stake , nothing else should be considered ; and if one is to travel , there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred.—better not move at all , better stay in london altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air . this is just what perry said . it seemed to him a very ill-judged measure . ”
austen	emma	“ both sir ! can the old lady ? ” ... “ the old lady ! no , the young lady , to be sure . i shall think you a great blockhead , frank , if you bring the aunt without the niece . ”
austen	emma	“ news ! oh ! yes , i always like news . what is it ? —why do you smile so ? —where did you hear it ? —at randalls ? ” he had time only to say , “ no , not at randalls ; i have not been near randalls , ” when the door was thrown open , and miss bates and miss fairfax walked into the room . full of thanks , and full of news , miss bates knew not which to give quickest . mr. knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment , and that not another syllable of communication could rest with him .
austen	emma	emma only nodded , and smiled.—after a little thinking , and a very tender sigh , he added , “ ah ! it is no difficulty to see who you take after ! your dear mother was so clever at all those things ! if i had but her memory ! but i can remember nothing ; —not even that particular riddle which you have heard me mention ; i can only recollect the first stanza ; and there are several .
austen	emma	time , she knew , must be allowed for this being thoroughly done ; and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general , and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to mr. elton in particular ; but it seemed to her reasonable that at harriet ’ s age , and with the entire extinction of all hope , such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of mr. elton ’ s return , as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance , without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them .
austen	emma	“ i see no probability in it , unless you have any better foundation than what you mention . his good-nature , his humanity , as i tell you , would be quite enough to account for the horses . he has a great regard for the bateses , you know , independent of jane fairfax—and is always glad to shew them attention . my dear mrs. weston , do not take to match-making . you do it very ill. jane fairfax mistress of the abbey ! —oh ! no , no ; —every feeling revolts . for his own sake , i would not have him do so mad a thing . ”
austen	emma	“ i have something to tell you , emma ; some news. ” “ good or bad ? ” said she , quickly , looking up in his face . “ i do not know which it ought to be called . ”
austen	emma	mr. elton was still talking , still engaged in some interesting detail ; and emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday ’ s party at his friend cole ’ s , and that she was come in herself for the stilton cheese , the north wiltshire , the butter , the celery , the beet-root , and all the dessert .
austen	emma	“ oh ! no , the meeting is certainly to-day , ” was the abrupt answer , which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on mrs. elton ’ s side.— “ i do believe , ” she continued , “ this is the most troublesome parish that ever was . we never heard of such things at maple grove . ”
austen	emma	“ i do own myself to have been completely mistaken in mr. elton . there is a littleness about him which you discovered , and which i did not : and i was fully convinced of his being in love with harriet . it was through a series of strange blunders ! ”
austen	emma	emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas , and hoped , by the help of backgammon , to get her father tolerably through the evening , and be attacked by no regrets but her own . the backgammon-table was placed ; but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary .
austen	emma	mrs. cole had many to agree with her ; every body who spoke on the subject was equally convinced that it must come from colonel campbell , and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made ; and there were enough ready to speak to allow emma to think her own way , and still listen to mrs. cole .
austen	emma	they met mr. martin the very next day , as they were walking on the donwell road . he was on foot , and after looking very respectfully at her , looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion . emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey ; and walking a few yards forward , while they talked together , soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with mr. robert martin . his appearance was very neat , and he looked like a sensible young man , but his person had no other advantage ; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen , she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in harriet ’ s inclination . harriet was not insensible of manner ; she had voluntarily noticed her father ’ s gentleness with admiration as well as wonder . mr. martin looked as if he did not know what manner was .
austen	emma	he hesitated , got up , walked to a window . “ in short , ” said he , “ perhaps , miss woodhouse—i think you can hardly be quite without suspicion ” — he looked at her , as if wanting to read her thoughts . she hardly knew what to say . it seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely serious , which she did not wish . forcing herself to speak , therefore , in the hope of putting it by , she calmly said ,
austen	emma	“ where is the young man ? ” said john knightley . “ has he been here on this occasion—or has he not ? ” “ he has not been here yet , ” replied emma . “ there was a strong expectation of his coming soon after the marriage , but it ended in nothing ; and i have not heard him mentioned lately . ”
austen	emma	“ nay , why do you ? ” “ me ! —i suppose i smile for pleasure at colonel campbell ’ s being so rich and so liberal.—it is a handsome present. ” “ very. ” “ i rather wonder that it was never made before . ”
austen	emma	the party was rather large , as it included one other family , a proper unobjectionable country family , whom the coles had the advantage of naming among their acquaintance , and the male part of mr. cox ’ s family , the lawyer of highbury . the less worthy females were to come in the evening , with miss bates , miss fairfax , and miss smith ; but already , at dinner , they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be general ; and , while politics and mr. elton were talked over , emma could fairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her neighbour . the first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend , was the name of jane fairfax . mrs. cole seemed to be relating something of her that was expected to be very interesting . she listened , and found it well worth listening to . that very dear part of emma , her fancy , received an amusing supply . mrs. cole was telling that she had been calling on miss bates , and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight of a pianoforte—a very elegant looking instrument—not a grand , but a large-sized square pianoforte ; and the substance of the story , the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize , and inquiry , and congratulations on her side , and explanations on miss bates ’ s , was , that this pianoforte had arrived from broadwood ’ s the day before , to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece—entirely unexpected ; that at first , by miss bates ’ s account , jane herself was quite at a loss , quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it—but now , they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarter ; —of course it must be from colonel campbell .
austen	emma	“ it is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined ! a great pity indeed ! and i have often wished—but it is so little one can venture to do—small , trifling presents , of any thing uncommon—now we have killed a porker , and emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg ; it is very small and delicate—hartfield pork is not like any other pork—but still it is pork—and , my dear emma , unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks , nicely fried , as ours are fried , without the smallest grease , and not roast it , for no stomach can bear roast pork—i think we had better send the leg—do not you think so , my dear ? ”
austen	emma	“ they aimed at wounding more than harriet , ” said he . “ emma , why is it that they are your enemies ? ” he looked with smiling penetration ; and , on receiving no answer , added , “ _she_ ought not to be angry with you , i suspect , whatever he may be.—to that surmise , you say nothing , of course ; but confess , emma , that you did want him to marry harriet . ”
austen	emma	mr. woodhouse at last was off ; but mr. knightley , instead of being immediately off likewise , sat down again , seemingly inclined for more chat . he began speaking of harriet , and speaking of her with more voluntary praise than emma had ever heard before .
austen	emma	“ my dear , you are too particular , ” said her husband . “ what does all that signify ? you will see nothing of it by candlelight . it will be as clean as randalls by candlelight . we never see any thing of it on our club-nights . ”
austen	emma	“ dreadful ! —exactly so , indeed.—she will be missed every moment. ” this was very proper ; the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable ; but it should have lasted longer . emma was rather in dismay when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things , and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment .
austen	emma	chapter xi it may be possible to do without dancing entirely . instances have been known of young people passing many , many months successively , without being at any ball of any description , and no material injury accrue either to body or mind ; —but when a beginning is made—when the felicities of rapid motion have once been , though slightly , felt—it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more .
austen	emma	“ what an excellent device , ” said he , “ the use of a sheepskin for carriages . how very comfortable they make it ; —impossible to feel cold with such precautions . the contrivances of modern days indeed have rendered a gentleman ’ s carriage perfectly complete . one is so fenced and guarded from the weather , that not a breath of air can find its way unpermitted . weather becomes absolutely of no consequence . it is a very cold afternoon—but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter.—ha ! snows a little i see . ”
austen	emma	chapter ix mr. knightley might quarrel with her , but emma could not quarrel with herself . he was so much displeased , that it was longer than usual before he came to hartfield again ; and when they did meet , his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven . she was sorry , but could not repent . on the contrary , her plans and proceedings were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days .
austen	emma	“ very well ; i will not plague you any more . emma shall be an angel , and i will keep my spleen to myself till christmas brings john and isabella . john loves emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection , and isabella always thinks as he does ; except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children . i am sure of having their opinions with me . ”
austen	emma	part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and mr. weston ’ s on the subject , as much as possible . there were wishes at randalls respecting emma ’ s destiny , but it was not desirable to have them suspected ; and the quiet transition which mr. knightley soon afterwards made to “ what does weston think of the weather ; shall we have rain ? ” convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about hartfield .
austen	emma	“ thank you . there will be very little merit in making a good wife to such a man as mr. weston. ” “ why , to own the truth , i am afraid you are rather thrown away , and that with every disposition to bear , there will be nothing to be borne . we will not despair , however . weston may grow cross from the wantonness of comfort , or his son may plague him . ”
austen	emma	she rose early , and wrote her letter to harriet ; an employment which left her so very serious , so nearly sad , that mr. knightley , in walking up to hartfield to breakfast , did not arrive at all too soon ; and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him , literally and figuratively , was quite necessary to reinstate her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before .
austen	emma	“ it would be very hard upon mr. weston if she did not , papa.—you quite forget poor mr. weston. ” “ i think , indeed , ” said john knightley pleasantly , “ that mr. weston has some little claim . you and i , emma , will venture to take the part of the poor husband . i , being a husband , and you not being a wife , the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force . as for isabella , she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the mr. westons aside as much as she can . ”
austen	emma	mrs. weston looked surprized , and said , “ i did not know that he ever had any such plan. ” “ nay , i had it from you . you wrote me word of it three months ago . ”
austen	emma	“ upon my word , emma. ” — “ your word ! —why not your honour ! —why not say upon your honour , that it has nothing to do with any of them ? good heavens ! —what can be to be _broke_ to me , that does not relate to one of that family ? ”
austen	emma	“ i do not often walk this way _now_ , ” said emma , as they proceeded , “ but _then_ there will be an inducement , and i shall gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges , gates , pools and pollards of this part of highbury . ”
austen	emma	“ i have lately imagined that i saw symptoms of attachment between them—certain expressive looks , which i did not believe meant to be public. ” “ oh ! you amuse me excessively . i am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander—but it will not do—very sorry to check you in your first essay—but indeed it will not do . there is no admiration between them , i do assure you ; and the appearances which have caught you , have arisen from some peculiar circumstances—feelings rather of a totally different nature—it is impossible exactly to explain : —there is a good deal of nonsense in it—but the part which is capable of being communicated , which is sense , is , that they are as far from any attachment or admiration for one another , as any two beings in the world can be . that is , i _presume_ it to be so on her side , and i can _answer_ for its being so on his . i will answer for the gentleman ’ s indifference . ”
austen	emma	“ he was four-and-twenty the 8th of last june , and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day ’ s difference—which is very odd. ” “ only four-and-twenty . that is too young to settle . his mother is perfectly right not to be in a hurry . they seem very comfortable as they are , and if she were to take any pains to marry him , she would probably repent it . six years hence , if he could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own , with a little money , it might be very desirable . ”
austen	emma	they were interrupted . tea was carrying round , and mr. weston , having said all that he wanted , soon took the opportunity of walking away . after tea , mr. and mrs. weston , and mr. elton sat down with mr. woodhouse to cards . the remaining five were left to their own powers , and emma doubted their getting on very well ; for mr. knightley seemed little disposed for conversation ; mrs. elton was wanting notice , which nobody had inclination to pay , and she was herself in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent .
austen	emma	“ oh ! but dear miss woodhouse , she is now in such retirement , such obscurity , so thrown away.—whatever advantages she may have enjoyed with the campbells are so palpably at an end ! and i think she feels it . i am sure she does . she is very timid and silent . one can see that she feels the want of encouragement . i like her the better for it . i must confess it is a recommendation to me . i am a great advocate for timidity—and i am sure one does not often meet with it.—but in those who are at all inferior , it is extremely prepossessing . oh ! i assure you , jane fairfax is a very delightful character , and interests me more than i can express . ”
austen	emma	“ it is my duty , and i am sure it is my wish , ” she continued , “ to have no reserves with you on this subject . as i am happily quite an altered creature in _one_ _respect_ , it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it . i do not want to say more than is necessary—i am too much ashamed of having given way as i have done , and i dare say you understand me . ”
austen	emma	her tears fell abundantly—but her grief was so truly artless , that no dignity could have made it more respectable in emma ’ s eyes—and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and understanding—really for the time convinced that harriet was the superior creature of the two—and that to resemble her would be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do .
austen	emma	mrs. bates and mrs. elton were together . miss bates was out , which accounted for the previous tranquillity . emma could have wished mrs. elton elsewhere ; but she was in a humour to have patience with every body ; and as mrs. elton met her with unusual graciousness , she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm .
austen	emma	chapter iv harriet smith ’ s intimacy at hartfield was soon a settled thing . quick and decided in her ways , emma lost no time in inviting , encouraging , and telling her to come very often ; and as their acquaintance increased , so did their satisfaction in each other . as a walking companion , emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her . in that respect mrs. weston ’ s loss had been important . her father never went beyond the shrubbery , where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long walk , or his short , as the year varied ; and since mrs. weston ’ s marriage her exercise had been too much confined . she had ventured once alone to randalls , but it was not pleasant ; and a harriet smith , therefore , one whom she could summon at any time to a walk , would be a valuable addition to her privileges . but in every respect , as she saw more of her , she approved her , and was confirmed in all her kind designs .
austen	emma	“ your parish there was small , ” said jane . “ upon my word , my dear , i do not know , for i never heard the subject talked of. ” “ but it is proved by the smallness of the school , which i have heard you speak of , as under the patronage of your sister and mrs. bragge ; the only school , and not more than five-and-twenty children . ”
austen	emma	“ you are very obliging ; but as to all that , i am very indifferent ; it would be no object to me to be with the rich ; my mortifications , i think , would only be the greater ; i should suffer more from comparison . a gentleman ’ s family is all that i should condition for . ”
austen	emma	“ oh ! my dear sir , how are you this morning ? my dear miss woodhouse—i come quite over-powered . such a beautiful hind-quarter of pork ! you are too bountiful ! have you heard the news ? mr. elton is going to be married . ”
austen	emma	busy as he was , however , the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing emma again . “ this is a pleasure , ” said he , in rather a low voice , “ coming at least ten minutes earlier than i had calculated . you find me trying to be useful ; tell me if you think i shall succeed . ”
austen	emma	“ oh ! ” cried emma , “ i know there is not a better creature in the world : but you must allow , that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her . ”
austen	emma	“ mr . elton ’ s manners are not perfect , ” replied emma ; “ but where there is a wish to please , one ought to overlook , and one does overlook a great deal . where a man does his best with only moderate powers , he will have the advantage over negligent superiority . there is such perfect good-temper and good-will in mr. elton as one can not but value . ”
austen	emma	it was as much as emma could bear , without being impolite . the idea of her being indebted to mrs. elton for what was called an _introduction_—of her going into public under the auspices of a friend of mrs. elton ’ s—probably some vulgar , dashing widow , who , with the help of a boarder , just made a shift to live ! —the dignity of miss woodhouse , of hartfield , was sunk indeed !
austen	emma	“ i do not say it is so ; but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not , and to regulate your behaviour accordingly . i think your manners to him encouraging . i speak as a friend , emma . you had better look about you , and ascertain what you do , and what you mean to do . ”
austen	emma	she stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse , and then resumed a more serious , more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been , and might be , and must be . the distressing explanation she had to make to harriet , and all that poor harriet would be suffering , with the awkwardness of future meetings , the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance , of subduing feelings , concealing resentment , and avoiding eclat , were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer , and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully .
austen	emma	“ emma , ” said she , “ this paper is worse than i expected . look ! in places you see it is dreadfully dirty ; and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing i could have imagined . ”
austen	emma	she soon resolved , equally as a duty and a pleasure , to employ half an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on miss fairfax.—she ought to go—and she was longing to see her ; the resemblance of their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill . it would be a _secret_ satisfaction ; but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any thing jane might communicate .
austen	emma	“ poor jane fairfax ! ” —thought emma.— “ you have not deserved this . you may have done wrong with regard to mr. dixon , but this is a punishment beyond what you can have merited ! —the kindness and protection of mrs. elton ! — ‘ jane fairfax and jane fairfax. ’ heavens ! let me not suppose that she dares go about , emma woodhouse-ing me ! —but upon my honour , there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman ’ s tongue ! ”
austen	emma	mrs. goddard , and the teachers , and the girls and the affairs of the school in general , formed naturally a great part of the conversation—and but for her acquaintance with the martins of abbey-mill farm , it must have been the whole . but the martins occupied her thoughts a good deal ; she had spent two very happy months with them , and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit , and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place . emma encouraged her talkativeness—amused by such a picture of another set of beings , and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of mrs. martin ’ s having “ _two_ parlours , two very good parlours , indeed ; one of them quite as large as mrs. goddard ’ s drawing-room ; and of her having an upper maid who had lived five-and-twenty years with her ; and of their having eight cows , two of them alderneys , and one a little welch cow , a very pretty little welch cow indeed ; and of mrs. martin ’ s saying as she was so fond of it , it should be called _her_ cow ; and of their having a very handsome summer-house in their garden , where some day next year they were all to drink tea : —a very handsome summer-house , large enough to hold a dozen people . ”
austen	emma	“ he ought to come , ” said emma . “ if he could stay only a couple of days , he ought to come ; and one can hardly conceive a young man ’ s not having it in his power to do as much as that . a young _woman_ , if she fall into bad hands , may be teased , and kept at a distance from those she wants to be with ; but one can not comprehend a young _man_ ’ s being under such restraint , as not to be able to spend a week with his father , if he likes it . ”
austen	emma	“ well , ” said he , in a deliberating manner , “ for five minutes , perhaps. ” “ and here is mrs. weston and mr. frank churchill too ! —quite delightful ; so many friends ! ” “ no , not now , i thank you . i could not stay two minutes . i must get on to kingston as fast as i can . ”
austen	emma	“ aye , do , frank.—go and fetch miss bates , and let us end the matter at once . she will enjoy the scheme , i am sure ; and i do not know a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties . fetch miss bates . we are growing a little too nice . she is a standing lesson of how to be happy . but fetch them both . invite them both . ”
austen	emma	“ i am quite sure , ” he replied , speaking very distinctly , “ that he told me she had accepted him ; and that there was no obscurity , nothing doubtful , in the words he used ; and i think i can give you a proof that it must be so . he asked my opinion as to what he was now to do . he knew of no one but mrs. goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends . could i mention any thing more fit to be done , than to go to mrs. goddard ? i assured him that i could not . then , he said , he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day . ”
austen	emma	“ you were speaking , ” said he , gravely . she recovered her voice . “ i was only going to observe , that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women , i can not imagine them to be very frequent . a hasty and imprudent attachment may arise—but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards . i would be understood to mean , that it can be only weak , irresolute characters , ( whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance , ) who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience , an oppression for ever . ”
austen	emma	mrs. weston was sorry for such a charge . she knew the importance of it , and said every thing in her power to do it away . every door was now closed , the passage plan given up , and the first scheme of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again ; and with such good-will on frank churchill ’ s part , that the space which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple , was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten .
austen	emma	“ yes—i have some right to that knowledge ; though i have never been at the place in my life.—she is an odd woman ! —but i never allow myself to speak ill of her , on frank ’ s account ; for i do believe her to be very fond of him . i used to think she was not capable of being fond of any body , except herself : but she has always been kind to him ( in her way—allowing for little whims and caprices , and expecting every thing to be as she likes ) . and it is no small credit , in my opinion , to him , that he should excite such an affection ; for , though i would not say it to any body else , she has no more heart than a stone to people in general ; and the devil of a temper . ”
austen	emma	“ oh ! are you there ? —but you are miserably behindhand . mr. cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago. ” he stopped.—emma felt her foot pressed by mrs. weston , and did not herself know what to think . in a moment he went on—
austen	emma	“ that sweet , amiable jane fairfax ! ” said mrs. john knightley.— “ it is so long since i have seen her , except now and then for a moment accidentally in town ! what happiness it must be to her good old grandmother and excellent aunt , when she comes to visit them ! i always regret excessively on dear emma ’ s account that she can not be more at highbury ; but now their daughter is married , i suppose colonel and mrs. campbell will not be able to part with her at all . she would be such a delightful companion for emma . ”
austen	emma	harriet smith was the natural daughter of somebody . somebody had placed her , several years back , at mrs. goddard ’ s school , and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour-boarder . this was all that was generally known of her history . she had no visible friends but what had been acquired at highbury , and was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her .
austen	emma	he listened in perfect silence . she wished him to speak , but he would not . she supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his clemency ; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in his opinion . she went on , however .
austen	emma	emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about mr. frank churchill ’ s not coming , except as a disappointment at randalls . the acquaintance at present had no charm for her . she wanted , rather , to be quiet , and out of temptation ; but still , as it was desirable that she should appear , in general , like her usual self , she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance , and enter as warmly into mr. and mrs. weston ’ s disappointment , as might naturally belong to their friendship .
austen	emma	mrs. weston was exceedingly disappointed—much more disappointed , in fact , than her husband , though her dependence on seeing the young man had been so much more sober : but a sanguine temper , though for ever expecting more good than occurs , does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression . it soon flies over the present failure , and begins to hope again . for half an hour mr. weston was surprized and sorry ; but then he began to perceive that frank ’ s coming two or three months later would be a much better plan ; better time of year ; better weather ; and that he would be able , without any doubt , to stay considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner .
austen	emma	to youth and natural cheerfulness like emma ’ s , though under temporary gloom at night , the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits . the youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy , and of powerful operation ; and if the distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed , they will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope .
austen	emma	“ colonel and mrs. campbell are to be in town again by midsummer , ” said jane . “ i must spend some time with them ; i am sure they will want it ; —afterwards i may probably be glad to dispose of myself . but i would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present . ”
austen	emma	“ yes , ” said john knightley , “ and i think we shall have a good deal of it. ” “ christmas weather , ” observed mr. elton . “ quite seasonable ; and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday , and prevent this day ’ s party , which it might very possibly have done , for mr. woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground ; but now it is of no consequence . this is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings . at christmas every body invites their friends about them , and people think little of even the worst weather . i was snowed up at a friend ’ s house once for a week . nothing could be pleasanter . i went for only one night , and could not get away till that very day se ’ nnight . ”
austen	emma	“ miss smith ! —message to miss smith ! —what could she possibly mean ! ” —and he repeated her words with such assurance of accent , such boastful pretence of amazement , that she could not help replying with quickness ,
austen	emma	“ she is not entirely without it , i think. ” “ i do not see much sign of it . she is playing _robin_ _adair_ at this moment—_his_ favourite. ” shortly afterwards miss bates , passing near the window , descried mr. knightley on horse-back not far off .
austen	emma	“ yes ; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move , and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure , and fancying himself extremely expert in finding excuses for it . he can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter , full of professions and falsehoods , and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father ’ s having any right to complain . his letters disgust me . ”
austen	emma	“ ah ! papa—that is what you never have been able to accomplish , and i do not think you ever will . isabella can not bear to stay behind her husband. ” this was too true for contradiction . unwelcome as it was , mr. woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh ; and as emma saw his spirits affected by the idea of his daughter ’ s attachment to her husband , she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them .
austen	emma	“ elegant , agreeable manners , i was prepared for , ” said he ; “ but i confess that , considering every thing , i had not expected more than a very tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age ; i did not know that i was to find a pretty young woman in mrs. weston . ”
austen	emma	she had already satisfied herself that he thought harriet a beautiful girl , which she trusted , with such frequent meetings at hartfield , was foundation enough on his side ; and on harriet ’ s there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy . and he was really a very pleasing young man , a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like . he was reckoned very handsome ; his person much admired in general , though not by her , there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with : —but the girl who could be gratified by a robert martin ’ s riding about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by mr. elton ’ s admiration .
austen	emma	it was a good scheme ; but on driving to the door they heard that neither “ master nor mistress was at home ; ” they had both been out some time ; the man believed they were gone to hartfield .
austen	emma	emma could hardly understand him ; he seemed in an odd humour . he walked off to find his father , but was quickly back again with both mr. and mrs. weston . he had met with them in a little perplexity , which must be laid before emma . it had just occurred to mrs. weston that mrs. elton must be asked to begin the ball ; that she would expect it ; which interfered with all their wishes of giving emma that distinction.—emma heard the sad truth with fortitude .
austen	emma	my first doth affliction denote , which my second is destin ’ d to feel and my whole is the best antidote that affliction to soften and heal.— made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some pages ago already .
austen	emma	mr. elton had retreated into the card-room , looking ( emma trusted ) very foolish . she did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife , though growing very like her ; —_she_ spoke some of her feelings , by observing audibly to her partner ,
austen	emma	“ do come with me , ” said mrs. weston , “ if it be not very disagreeable to you . it need not detain us long . we will go to hartfield afterwards . we will follow them to hartfield . i really wish you to call with me . it will be felt so great an attention ! and i always thought you meant it . ”
austen	emma	time did not compose her . as she reflected more , she seemed but to feel it more . she never had been so depressed . happily it was not necessary to speak . there was only harriet , who seemed not in spirits herself , fagged , and very willing to be silent ; and emma felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home , without being at any trouble to check them , extraordinary as they were .
austen	emma	she was just as determined when the morrow came , and went early , that nothing might prevent her . it was not unlikely , she thought , that she might see mr. knightley in her way ; or , perhaps , he might come in while she were paying her visit . she had no objection . she would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence , so justly and truly hers . her eyes were towards donwell as she walked , but she saw him not .
austen	emma	“ to be sure . oh yes ! it is not likely you should ever have observed him ; but he knows you very well indeed—i mean by sight. ” “ i have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man . i know , indeed , that he is so , and , as such , wish him well . what do you imagine his age to be ? ”
austen	emma	“ she must have some motive , more powerful than appears , for refusing this invitation , ” was emma ’ s conclusion . “ she must be under some sort of penance , inflicted either by the campbells or herself . there is great fear , great caution , great resolution somewhere.—she is _not_ to be with the _dixons_ . the decree is issued by somebody . but why must she consent to be with the eltons ? —here is quite a separate puzzle . ”
austen	emma	presently mr. knightley looked back , and came and sat down by her . they talked at first only of the performance . his admiration was certainly very warm ; yet she thought , but for mrs. weston , it would not have struck her . as a sort of touchstone , however , she began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece ; and though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short , she believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own .
austen	emma	“ let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed , ” cried emma . “ at this moment , perhaps , mr. elton is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters , telling how much more beautiful is the original , and after being asked for it five or six times , allowing them to hear your name , your own dear name . ”
austen	emma	“ there is no denying it , ” he replied . “ i agree with you exactly . a crowd in a little room—miss woodhouse , you have the art of giving pictures in a few words . exquisite , quite exquisite ! —still , however , having proceeded so far , one is unwilling to give the matter up . it would be a disappointment to my father—and altogether—i do not know that—i am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well . ”
austen	emma	this was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day ’ s visit might not afford , which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour ; but the very sight of mrs. weston , her smile , her touch , her voice was grateful to emma , and she determined to think as little as possible of mr. elton ’ s oddities , or of any thing else unpleasant , and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost .
austen	emma	“ i mean that he has done it , ” answered mr. knightley , with smiling but determined decision , “ and been accepted. ” “ good god ! ” she cried.— “ well ! ” —then having recourse to her workbasket , in excuse for leaning down her face , and concealing all the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be expressing , she added , “ well , now tell me every thing ; make this intelligible to me . how , where , when ? —let me know it all . i never was more surprized—but it does not make me unhappy , i assure you.—how—how has it been possible ? ”
austen	emma	“ ah , my dear , ” said he , “ poor miss taylor—it is a grievous business. ” “ oh yes , sir , ” cried she with ready sympathy , “ how you must miss her ! and dear emma , too ! —what a dreadful loss to you both ! —i have been so grieved for you.—i could not imagine how you could possibly do without her.—it is a sad change indeed.—but i hope she is pretty well , sir . ”
austen	emma	emma would not agree to this , and began a warm defence of miss fairfax ’ s complexion . “ it was certainly never brilliant , but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general ; and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face. ” he listened with all due deference ; acknowledged that he had heard many people say the same—but yet he must confess , that to him nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health . where features were indifferent , a fine complexion gave beauty to them all ; and where they were good , the effect was—fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the effect was .
austen	emma	“ mr . elton going to be married ! ” said emma , as soon as she could speak . “ he will have every body ’ s wishes for his happiness. ” “ he is very young to settle , ” was mr. woodhouse ’ s observation . “ he had better not be in a hurry . he seemed to me very well off as he was . we were always glad to see him at hartfield . ”
austen	emma	emma was most sincerely interested . her heart had been long growing kinder towards jane ; and this picture of her present sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion , and left her nothing but pity ; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past , obliged her to admit that jane might very naturally resolve on seeing mrs. cole or any other steady friend , when she might not bear to see herself . she spoke as she felt , with earnest regret and solicitude—sincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected from miss bates to be now actually determined on , might be as much for miss fairfax ’ s advantage and comfort as possible . “ it must be a severe trial to them all . she had understood it was to be delayed till colonel campbell ’ s return . ”
austen	emma	“ john does not even mention your friend , ” said mr. knightley . “ here is his answer , if you like to see it. ” it was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage . emma accepted it with a very eager hand , with an impatience all alive to know what he would say about it , and not at all checked by hearing that her friend was unmentioned .
austen	emma	“ ah ! —well—to be sure . yes , i see what she means , ( turning to mr. knightley , ) and i will try to hold my tongue . i must make myself very disagreeable , or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend . ”
austen	emma	“ this is too bad , ” cried emma , as they turned away . “ and now we shall just miss them ; too provoking ! —i do not know when i have been so disappointed. ” and she leaned back in the corner , to indulge her murmurs , or to reason them away ; probably a little of both—such being the commonest process of a not ill-disposed mind . presently the carriage stopt ; she looked up ; it was stopt by mr. and mrs. weston , who were standing to speak to her . there was instant pleasure in the sight of them , and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound—for mr. weston immediately accosted her with ,
austen	emma	“ so obliged to you ! —so very much obliged to you for the carriage , ” resumed miss bates . he cut her short with , “ i am going to kingston . can i do any thing for you ? ”
austen	emma	“ i did not mean , i was not thinking of the slave-trade , ” replied jane ; “ governess-trade , i assure you , was all that i had in view ; widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on ; but as to the greater misery of the victims , i do not know where it lies . but i only mean to say that there are advertising offices , and that by applying to them i should have no doubt of very soon meeting with something that would do . ”
austen	emma	“ i am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case , ” replied emma ; “ but am disposed to side with you , mr. weston . if you think he will come , i shall think so too ; for you know enscombe . ”
austen	emma	“ the ladies were all at home. ” she had never rejoiced at the sound before , nor ever before entered the passage , nor walked up the stairs , with any wish of giving pleasure , but in conferring obligation , or of deriving it , except in subsequent ridicule .
austen	emma	“ i have escaped ; and that i should escape , may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself . but this does not acquit _him_ , mrs. weston ; and i must say , that i think him greatly to blame . what right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged , and with manners so _very_ disengaged ? what right had he to endeavour to please , as he certainly did—to distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention , as he certainly did—while he really belonged to another ? —how could he tell what mischief he might be doing ? —how could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him ? —very wrong , very wrong indeed . ”
austen	emma	the house belonged to people in business . mrs. and miss bates occupied the drawing-room floor ; and there , in the very moderate-sized apartment , which was every thing to them , the visitors were most cordially and even gratefully welcomed ; the quiet neat old lady , who with her knitting was seated in the warmest corner , wanting even to give up her place to miss woodhouse , and her more active , talking daughter , almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness , thanks for their visit , solicitude for their shoes , anxious inquiries after mr. woodhouse ’ s health , cheerful communications about her mother ’ s , and sweet-cake from the beaufet— “ mrs . cole had just been there , just called in for ten minutes , and had been so good as to sit an hour with them , and _she_ had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked it very much ; and , therefore , she hoped miss woodhouse and miss smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too . ”
austen	emma	they went in ; and while the sleek , well-tied parcels of “ men ’ s beavers ” and “ york tan ” were bringing down and displaying on the counter , he said— “ but i beg your pardon , miss woodhouse , you were speaking to me , you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my _amor_ _patriae_ . do not let me lose it . i assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life . ”
austen	emma	two dances , unfortunately , were all that could be allowed . it was growing late , and miss bates became anxious to get home , on her mother ’ s account . after some attempts , therefore , to be permitted to begin again , they were obliged to thank mrs. weston , look sorrowful , and have done .
austen	emma	“ i should not wonder , ” said mrs. weston , “ if miss fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination , by her aunt ’ s eagerness in accepting mrs. elton ’ s civilities for her . poor miss bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated , in spite of the very natural wish of a little change . ”
austen	emma	“ do you think so ? ” replied he . “ i can not agree with you . it appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature . i never saw such a likeness in my life . we must allow for the effect of shade , you know . ”
austen	emma	emma could not help laughing as she answered , “ upon my word , i believe you know her quite as well as i do.—but , mr. knightley , are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _accepted_ him . i could suppose she might in time—but can she already ? —did not you misunderstand him ? —you were both talking of other things ; of business , shows of cattle , or new drills—and might not you , in the confusion of so many subjects , mistake him ? —it was not harriet ’ s hand that he was certain of—it was the dimensions of some famous ox . ”
austen	emma	emma listened , and looked , and soon perceived that frank churchill ’ s state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour . some people were always cross when they were hot . such might be his constitution ; and as she knew that eating and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints , she recommended his taking some refreshment ; he would find abundance of every thing in the dining-room—and she humanely pointed out the door .
austen	emma	“ i am very glad , indeed , my dear , to hear she is to be so comfortably settled . mrs. elton is very good-natured and agreeable , and i dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be . i hope it is a dry situation , and that her health will be taken good care of . it ought to be a first object , as i am sure poor miss taylor ’ s always was with me . you know , my dear , she is going to be to this new lady what miss taylor was to us . and i hope she will be better off in one respect , and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long . ”
austen	emma	“ you should have gone to cromer , my dear , if you went anywhere.—perry was a week at cromer once , and he holds it to be the best of all the sea-bathing places . a fine open sea , he says , and very pure air . and , by what i understand , you might have had lodgings there quite away from the sea—a quarter of a mile off—very comfortable . you should have consulted perry . ”
austen	emma	“ she had engaged to go as governess to mrs. smallridge ’ s children—a dear friend of mrs. elton ’ s—a neighbour of maple grove ; and , by the bye , i wonder how mrs. elton bears the disappointment ? ”
austen	emma	she was then interrupted by harriet ’ s coming in ; and if harriet ’ s praise could have satisfied her , she might soon have been comforted . “ oh ! if i could but play as well as you and miss fairfax ! ”
austen	emma	it was so long since emma had been at the abbey , that as soon as she was satisfied of her father ’ s comfort , she was glad to leave him , and look around her ; eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particular observation , more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family .
austen	emma	“ it is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected . i am sure , a month ago , i had no more idea myself ! —the strangest things do take place ! ” “ when miss smiths and mr. eltons get acquainted—they do indeed—and really it is strange ; it is out of the common course that what is so evidently , so palpably desirable—what courts the pre-arrangement of other people , should so immediately shape itself into the proper form . you and mr. elton are by situation called together ; you belong to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes . your marrying will be equal to the match at randalls . there does seem to be a something in the air of hartfield which gives love exactly the right direction , and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow .
austen	emma	this she had been prepared for when she entered the house ; but meant , having once talked him handsomely over , to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome topic , and to wander at large amongst all the mistresses and misses of highbury , and their card-parties . she had not been prepared to have jane fairfax succeed mr. elton ; but he was actually hurried off by miss bates , she jumped away from him at last abruptly to the coles , to usher in a letter from her niece .
austen	emma	emma could not regret her having gone to miss bates , but she wished she had left her ten minutes earlier ; —it would have been a great pleasure to talk over jane fairfax ’ s situation with mr. knightley.—neither would she regret that he should be going to brunswick square , for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed—but it might have happened at a better time—and to have had longer notice of it , would have been pleasanter.—they parted thorough friends , however ; she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance , and his unfinished gallantry ; —it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered his good opinion.—he had been sitting with them half an hour , she found . it was a pity that she had not come back earlier !
austen	emma	“ not at all , ” cried he ; “ i am much obliged to you for it . it is very good advice , and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often found ; for it shall be attended to . ”
austen	emma	“ oh ! papa , we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married . either in the morning or evening of every day , excepting one , have we seen either mr. weston or mrs. weston , and generally both , either at randalls or here—and as you may suppose , isabella , most frequently here . they are very , very kind in their visits . mr. weston is really as kind as herself . papa , if you speak in that melancholy way , you will be giving isabella a false idea of us all . every body must be aware that miss taylor must be missed , but every body ought also to be assured that mr. and mrs. weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated—which is the exact truth . ”
austen	emma	“ nay , dear emma , now i must take his part ; for though he has been wrong in this instance , i have known him long enough to answer for his having many , very many , good qualities ; and— ”
austen	emma	emma laughed , and replied : “ but i had the assistance of all your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people . i doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it . ”
austen	emma	this appeal to her affections did more than all the rest . the idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for miss woodhouse , whom she really loved extremely , made her wretched for a while , and when the violence of grief was comforted away , still remained powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it very tolerably .
austen	emma	his dancing proved to be just what she had believed it , extremely good ; and harriet would have seemed almost too lucky , if it had not been for the cruel state of things before , and for the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features announced . it was not thrown away on her , she bounded higher than ever , flew farther down the middle , and was in a continual course of smiles .
austen	emma	the very first subject after being seated was maple grove , “ my brother mr. suckling ’ s seat ; ” —a comparison of hartfield to maple grove . the grounds of hartfield were small , but neat and pretty ; and the house was modern and well-built . mrs. elton seemed most favourably impressed by the size of the room , the entrance , and all that she could see or imagine . “ very like maple grove indeed ! —she was quite struck by the likeness ! —that room was the very shape and size of the morning-room at maple grove ; her sister ’ s favourite room. ” —mr . elton was appealed to.— “ was not it astonishingly like ? —she could really almost fancy herself at maple grove . ”
austen	emma	he could say no more ; and with the hope of hartfield to reward him , returned with mrs. weston to mrs. bates ’ s door . emma watched them in , and then joined harriet at the interesting counter , —trying , with all the force of her own mind , to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured ; and that a blue ribbon , be it ever so beautiful , would still never match her yellow pattern . at last it was all settled , even to the destination of the parcel .
austen	emma	mr. knightley grew angry . “ that fellow , ” said he , indignantly , “ thinks of nothing but shewing off his own voice . this must not be. ” and touching miss bates , who at that moment passed near— “ miss bates , are you mad , to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner ? go , and interfere . they have no mercy on her . ”
austen	emma	“ yes ; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays . even if this family , the braithwaites , are put off , i am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us . i can not bear to imagine any reluctance on his side ; but i am sure there is a great wish on the churchills ’ to keep him to themselves . there is jealousy . they are jealous even of his regard for his father . in short , i can feel no dependence on his coming , and i wish mr. weston were less sanguine . ”
austen	emma	the real evils , indeed , of emma ’ s situation were the power of having rather too much her own way , and a disposition to think a little too well of herself ; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments . the danger , however , was at present so unperceived , that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her .
austen	emma	the misfortune of harriet ’ s cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival . mr. woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it , besides all the history of his own and isabella ’ s coming , and of emma ’ s being to follow , and had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that james should come and see his daughter , when the others appeared , and mrs. weston , who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him , was able to turn away and welcome her dear emma .
austen	emma	“ ah ! harriet , here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good thoughts . well , ( smiling , ) i hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers , it has done all that is truly important . if we feel for the wretched , enough to do all we can for them , the rest is empty sympathy , only distressing to ourselves . ”
austen	emma	“ i believe it is very true , my dear , indeed , ” said mr. woodhouse , with a sigh . “ i am afraid i am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome. ” “ my dearest papa ! you do not think i could mean _you_ , or suppose mr. knightley to mean _you_ . what a horrible idea ! oh no ! i meant only myself . mr. knightley loves to find fault with me , you know—in a joke—it is all a joke . we always say what we like to one another . ”
austen	emma	“ is not this most vexatious , knightley ? ” she cried.— “ and such weather for exploring ! —these delays and disappointments are quite odious . what are we to do ? —the year will wear away at this rate , and nothing done . before this time last year i assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from maple grove to kings weston . ”
austen	emma	“ yes , sometimes he can. ” “ and those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while ; whenever there is any temptation of pleasure. ” “ it is very unfair to judge of any body ’ s conduct , without an intimate knowledge of their situation . nobody , who has not been in the interior of a family , can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be . we ought to be acquainted with enscombe , and with mrs. churchill ’ s temper , before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do . he may , at times , be able to do a great deal more than he can at others . ”
austen	emma	his good friend perry , too , whom he had spoken to on the subject , did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind ; but he had desired perry to be upon the watch , and as he went about so much , something , he thought , might come from that quarter .
austen	emma	“ those who knew any thing about it , must have felt the difference . the truth is , harriet , that my playing is just good enough to be praised , but jane fairfax ’ s is much beyond it . ”
austen	emma	“ nay , she has always been a first favourite with him , as you very well know. ” “ but the imprudence of such a match ! ” “ i am not speaking of its prudence ; merely its probability . ”
austen	emma	he professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend—her fair , lovely , amiable friend . “ did she know ? —had she heard any thing about her , since their being at randalls ? —he felt much anxiety—he must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably. ” and in this style he talked on for some time very properly , not much attending to any answer , but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat ; and emma was quite in charity with him .
austen	emma	it was not very long , though rather longer than mr. weston had foreseen , before she had the power of forming some opinion of frank churchill ’ s feelings . the enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been imagined , but he was at highbury very soon afterwards . he rode down for a couple of hours ; he could not yet do more ; but as he came from randalls immediately to hartfield , she could then exercise all her quick observation , and speedily determine how he was influenced , and how she must act . they met with the utmost friendliness . there could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her . but she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he had done , of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree . she watched him well . it was a clear thing he was less in love than he had been . absence , with the conviction probably of her indifference , had produced this very natural and very desirable effect .
austen	emma	“ emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old . i have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through—and very good lists they were—very well chosen , and very neatly arranged—sometimes alphabetically , and sometimes by some other rule . the list she drew up when only fourteen—i remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit , that i preserved it some time ; and i dare say she may have made out a very good list now . but i have done with expecting any course of steady reading from emma . she will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience , and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding . where miss taylor failed to stimulate , i may safely affirm that harriet smith will do nothing.—you never could persuade her to read half so much as you wished.—you know you could not . ”
austen	emma	“ you speak as if you envied him. ” “ and i do envy him , emma . in one respect he is the object of my envy. ” emma could say no more . they seemed to be within half a sentence of harriet , and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject , if possible . she made her plan ; she would speak of something totally different—the children in brunswick square ; and she only waited for breath to begin , when mr. knightley startled her , by saying ,
austen	emma	“ cautious , very cautious , ” thought emma ; “ he advances inch by inch , and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure. ” still , however , though every thing had not been accomplished by her ingenious device , she could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both , and must be leading them forward to the great event .
austen	emma	“ me ! ” cried emma , shaking her head.— “ ah ! poor harriet ! ” she checked herself , however , and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she deserved . their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her father . she was not sorry . she wanted to be alone . her mind was in a state of flutter and wonder , which made it impossible for her to be collected . she was in dancing , singing , exclaiming spirits ; and till she had moved about , and talked to herself , and laughed and reflected , she could be fit for nothing rational .
austen	emma	mrs. elton was very much disappointed . it was the delay of a great deal of pleasure and parade . her introductions and recommendations must all wait , and every projected party be still only talked of . so she thought at first ; —but a little consideration convinced her that every thing need not be put off . why should not they explore to box hill though the sucklings did not come ? they could go there again with them in the autumn . it was settled that they should go to box hill . that there was to be such a party had been long generally known : it had even given the idea of another . emma had never been to box hill ; she wished to see what every body found so well worth seeing , and she and mr. weston had agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither . two or three more of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them , and it was to be done in a quiet , unpretending , elegant way , infinitely superior to the bustle and preparation , the regular eating and drinking , and picnic parade of the eltons and the sucklings .
austen	emma	“ you are acquainted with miss jane fairfax , sir , are you ? ” said mr. woodhouse , always the last to make his way in conversation ; “ then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady . she is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt , very worthy people ; i have known them all my life . they will be extremely glad to see you , i am sure ; and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way . ”
austen	emma	“ so very obliging of you ! —no rain at all . nothing to signify . i do not care for myself . quite thick shoes . and jane declares—well ! — ( as soon as she was within the door ) well ! this is brilliant indeed ! —this is admirable ! —excellently contrived , upon my word . nothing wanting . could not have imagined it.—so well lighted up ! —jane , jane , look ! —did you ever see any thing ? oh ! mr. weston , you must really have had aladdin ’ s lamp . good mrs. stokes would not know her own room again . i saw her as i came in ; she was standing in the entrance . ‘ oh ! mrs. stokes , ’ said i—but i had not time for more. ” she was now met by mrs. weston.— “ very well , i thank you , ma ’ am . i hope you are quite well . very happy to hear it . so afraid you might have a headache ! —seeing you pass by so often , and knowing how much trouble you must have . delighted to hear it indeed . ah ! dear mrs. elton , so obliged to you for the carriage ! —excellent time . jane and i quite ready . did not keep the horses a moment . most comfortable carriage.—oh ! and i am sure our thanks are due to you , mrs. weston , on that score . mrs. elton had most kindly sent jane a note , or we should have been.—but two such offers in one day ! —never were such neighbours . i said to my mother , ‘ upon my word , ma ’ am—. ’ thank you , my mother is remarkably well . gone to mr. woodhouse ’ s . i made her take her shawl—for the evenings are not warm—her large new shawl— mrs. dixon ’ s wedding-present.—so kind of her to think of my mother ! bought at weymouth , you know—mr . dixon ’ s choice . there were three others , jane says , which they hesitated about some time . colonel campbell rather preferred an olive . my dear jane , are you sure you did not wet your feet ? —it was but a drop or two , but i am so afraid : —but mr. frank churchill was so extremely—and there was a mat to step upon—i shall never forget his extreme politeness.—oh ! mr. frank churchill , i must tell you my mother ’ s spectacles have never been in fault since ; the rivet never came out again . my mother often talks of your good-nature . does not she , jane ? —do not we often talk of mr. frank churchill ? —ah ! here ’ s miss woodhouse.—dear miss woodhouse , how do you do ? —very well i thank you , quite well . this is meeting quite in fairy-land ! —such a transformation ! —must not compliment , i know ( eyeing emma most complacently ) —that would be rude—but upon my word , miss woodhouse , you do look—how do you like jane ’ s hair ? —you are a judge.—she did it all herself . quite wonderful how she does her hair ! —no hairdresser from london i think could.—ah ! dr. hughes i declare—and mrs. hughes . must go and speak to dr. and mrs. hughes for a moment.—how do you do ? how do you do ? —very well , i thank you . this is delightful , is not it ? —where ’ s dear mr. richard ? —oh ! there he is . don ’ t disturb him . much better employed talking to the young ladies . how do you do , mr. richard ? —i saw you the other day as you rode through the town—mrs . otway , i protest ! —and good mr. otway , and miss otway and miss caroline.—such a host of friends ! —and mr. george and mr. arthur ! —how do you do ? how do you all do ? —quite well , i am much obliged to you . never better.—don ’ t i hear another carriage ? —who can this be ? —very likely the worthy coles.—upon my word , this is charming to be standing about among such friends ! and such a noble fire ! —i am quite roasted . no coffee , i thank you , for me—never take coffee.—a little tea if you please , sir , by and bye , —no hurry—oh ! here it comes . every thing so good ! ”
austen	emma	“ mr . martin ! no indeed ! —there was not a hint of mr. martin . i hope i know better now , than to care for mr. martin , or to be suspected of it. ” when harriet had closed her evidence , she appealed to her dear miss woodhouse , to say whether she had not good ground for hope .
austen	emma	“ thank you , but i would rather you did not mention the subject to her ; till the time draws nearer , i do not wish to be giving any body trouble. ” “ but , my dear child , the time is drawing near ; here is april , and june , or say even july , is very near , with such business to accomplish before us . your inexperience really amuses me ! a situation such as you deserve , and your friends would require for you , is no everyday occurrence , is not obtained at a moment ’ s notice ; indeed , indeed , we must begin inquiring directly . ”
austen	emma	the ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant , “ men never know when things are dirty or not ; ” and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to himself , “ women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares . ”
austen	emma	her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to mrs. weston , and of moments only of regret ; and her satisfaction—her more than satisfaction—her cheerful enjoyment , was so just and so apparent , that emma , well as she knew her father , was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity ‘ poor miss taylor , ’ when they left her at randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort , or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own . but never did she go without mr. woodhouse ’ s giving a gentle sigh , and saying , “ ah , poor miss taylor ! she would be very glad to stay . ”
austen	emma	chapter vii the very day of mr. elton ’ s going to london produced a fresh occasion for emma ’ s services towards her friend . harriet had been at hartfield , as usual , soon after breakfast ; and , after a time , had gone home to return again to dinner : she returned , and sooner than had been talked of , and with an agitated , hurried look , announcing something extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell . half a minute brought it all out . she had heard , as soon as she got back to mrs. goddard ’ s , that mr. martin had been there an hour before , and finding she was not at home , nor particularly expected , had left a little parcel for her from one of his sisters , and gone away ; and on opening this parcel , she had actually found , besides the two songs which she had lent elizabeth to copy , a letter to herself ; and this letter was from him , from mr. martin , and contained a direct proposal of marriage . “ who could have thought it ? she was so surprized she did not know what to do . yes , quite a proposal of marriage ; and a very good letter , at least she thought so . and he wrote as if he really loved her very much—but she did not know—and so , she was come as fast as she could to ask miss woodhouse what she should do.— ” emma was half-ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful .
austen	emma	“ mrs . bates , let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs . an egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome . serle understands boiling an egg better than any body . i would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else ; but you need not be afraid , they are very small , you see—one of our small eggs will not hurt you . miss bates , let emma help you to a _little_ bit of tart—a _very_ little bit . ours are all apple-tarts . you need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here . i do not advise the custard . mrs. goddard , what say you to _half_ a glass of wine ? a _small_ half-glass , put into a tumbler of water ? i do not think it could disagree with you . ”
austen	emma	“ myself creating what i saw , ” brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private liking , of private understanding even , between frank churchill and jane . he had walked up one day after dinner , as he very often did , to spend his evening at hartfield . emma and harriet were going to walk ; he joined them ; and , on returning , they fell in with a larger party , who , like themselves , judged it wisest to take their exercise early , as the weather threatened rain ; mr. and mrs. weston and their son , miss bates and her niece , who had accidentally met . they all united ; and , on reaching hartfield gates , emma , who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father , pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him . the randalls party agreed to it immediately ; and after a pretty long speech from miss bates , which few persons listened to , she also found it possible to accept dear miss woodhouse ’ s most obliging invitation .
austen	emma	harriet ’ s cheerful look and manner established hers : she came back , not to think of mr. martin , but to talk of mr. elton . miss nash had been telling her something , which she repeated immediately with great delight . mr. perry had been to mrs. goddard ’ s to attend a sick child , and miss nash had seen him , and he had told miss nash , that as he was coming back yesterday from clayton park , he had met mr. elton , and found to his great surprize , that mr. elton was actually on his road to london , and not meaning to return till the morrow , though it was the whist-club night , which he had been never known to miss before ; and mr. perry had remonstrated with him about it , and told him how shabby it was in him , their best player , to absent himself , and tried very much to persuade him to put off his journey only one day ; but it would not do ; mr. elton had been determined to go on , and had said in a _very_ _particular_ way indeed , that he was going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the world ; and something about a very enviable commission , and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious . mr. perry could not quite understand him , but he was very sure there must be a _lady_ in the case , and he told him so ; and mr. elton only looked very conscious and smiling , and rode off in great spirits . miss nash had told her all this , and had talked a great deal more about mr. elton ; and said , looking so very significantly at her , “ that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be , but she only knew that any woman whom mr. elton could prefer , she should think the luckiest woman in the world ; for , beyond a doubt , mr. elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness . ”
austen	emma	mrs. elton took a great fancy to jane fairfax ; and from the first . not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend the other , but from the very first ; and she was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration—but without solicitation , or plea , or privilege , she must be wanting to assist and befriend her.—before emma had forfeited her confidence , and about the third time of their meeting , she heard all mrs. elton ’ s knight-errantry on the subject.—
austen	emma	while she talked of his son , mr. weston ’ s attention was chained ; but when she got to maple grove , he could recollect that there were ladies just arriving to be attended to , and with happy smiles must hurry away .
austen	emma	“ it is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount . he can not want money—he can not want leisure . we know , on the contrary , that he has so much of both , that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom . we hear of him for ever at some watering-place or other . a little while ago , he was at weymouth . this proves that he can leave the churchills . ”
austen	emma	emma scarcely heard what was said.—her mind was divided between two ideas—her own former conversations with him about miss fairfax ; and poor harriet ; —and for some time she could only exclaim , and require confirmation , repeated confirmation .
austen	emma	“ i do not know , my dear—but it is so long since she was here ! —not since last easter , and then only for a few days.—mr . john knightley ’ s being a lawyer is very inconvenient.—poor isabella ! —she is sadly taken away from us all ! —and how sorry she will be when she comes , not to see miss taylor here ! ”
austen	emma	“ six years hence ! dear miss woodhouse , he would be thirty years old ! ” “ well , and that is as early as most men can afford to marry , who are not born to an independence . mr. martin , i imagine , has his fortune entirely to make— can not be at all beforehand with the world . whatever money he might come into when his father died , whatever his share of the family property , it is , i dare say , all afloat , all employed in his stock , and so forth ; and though , with diligence and good luck , he may be rich in time , it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet . ”
austen	emma	after this , he made some progress without any pause . frank churchill ’ s confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing . “ i perfectly agree with you , sir , ” —was then his remark . “ you did behave very shamefully . you never wrote a truer line. ” and having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement , and his persisting to act in direct opposition to jane fairfax ’ s sense of right , he made a fuller pause to say , “ this is very bad.—he had induced her to place herself , for his sake , in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness , and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily.—she must have had much more to contend with , in carrying on the correspondence , than he could . he should have respected even unreasonable scruples , had there been such ; but hers were all reasonable . we must look to her one fault , and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement , to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment . ”
austen	emma	emma was not sorry to be pressed . she read , and was surprized . the style of the letter was much above her expectation . there were not merely no grammatical errors , but as a composition it would not have disgraced a gentleman ; the language , though plain , was strong and unaffected , and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer . it was short , but expressed good sense , warm attachment , liberality , propriety , even delicacy of feeling . she paused over it , while harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion , with a “ well , well , ” and was at last forced to add , “ is it a good letter ? or is it too short ? ”
austen	emma	she could have made an inquiry or two , as to the expedition and the expense of the irish mails ; —it was at her tongue ’ s end—but she abstained . she was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt jane fairfax ’ s feelings ; and they followed the other ladies out of the room , arm in arm , with an appearance of good-will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each .
austen	emma	“ not at all , sir . it is a beautiful moonlight night ; and so mild that i must draw back from your great fire. ” “ but you must have found it very damp and dirty . i wish you may not catch cold . ”
austen	emma	jane ’ s curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to occupy her . “ no—i have never seen mr. elton , ” she replied , starting on this appeal ; “ is he—is he a tall man ? ”
austen	emma	he perfectly agreed with her : and after walking together so long , and thinking so much alike , emma felt herself so well acquainted with him , that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting . he was not exactly what she had expected ; less of the man of the world in some of his notions , less of the spoiled child of fortune , therefore better than she had expected . his ideas seemed more moderate—his feelings warmer . she was particularly struck by his manner of considering mr. elton ’ s house , which , as well as the church , he would go and look at , and would not join them in finding much fault with . no , he could not believe it a bad house ; not such a house as a man was to be pitied for having . if it were to be shared with the woman he loved , he could not think any man to be pitied for having that house . there must be ample room in it for every real comfort . the man must be a blockhead who wanted more .
austen	emma	“ you have made her too tall , emma , ” said mr. knightley . emma knew that she had , but would not own it ; and mr. elton warmly added , “ oh no ! certainly not too tall ; not in the least too tall . consider , she is sitting down—which naturally presents a different—which in short gives exactly the idea—and the proportions must be preserved , you know . proportions , fore-shortening.—oh no ! it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as miss smith ’ s . exactly so indeed ! ”
austen	emma	“ miss woodhouse , as you will not give me your opinion , i must do as well as i can by myself ; and i have now quite determined , and really almost made up my mind—to refuse mr. martin . do you think i am right ? ”
austen	emma	he had done his duty and could return to his son . “ when frank left us , ” continued he , “ it was quite uncertain when we might see him again , which makes this day ’ s news doubly welcome . it has been completely unexpected . that is , _i_ always had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon , i was sure something favourable would turn up—but nobody believed me . he and mrs. weston were both dreadfully desponding . ‘ how could he contrive to come ? and how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again ? ’ and so forth—i always felt that something would happen in our favour ; and so it has , you see . i have observed , mrs. elton , in the course of my life , that if things are going untowardly one month , they are sure to mend the next . ”
austen	emma	he laughed rather consciously ; and though denying the sentiment , emma was convinced that it had been so . “ and you must be off this very morning ? ” “ yes ; my father is to join me here : we shall walk back together , and i must be off immediately . i am almost afraid that every moment will bring him . ”
austen	emma	“ from something that he said , my dear emma , i rather imagine— ” “ and how could _she_ bear such behaviour ! composure with a witness ! to look on , while repeated attentions were offering to another woman , before her face , and not resent it.—that is a degree of placidity , which i can neither comprehend nor respect . ”
austen	emma	“ _my_ report from mrs. goddard ’ s , ” said she presently , “ was not so pleasant as i had hoped— ‘ not better ’ was _my_ answer. ” his face lengthened immediately ; and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he answered .
austen	emma	how that visit was to be acknowledged—what would be necessary—and what might be safest , had been a point of some doubtful consideration . absolute neglect of the mother and sisters , when invited to come , would be ingratitude . it must not be : and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance— !
austen	emma	“ quite out of the question , quite out of the question , ” he replied ; — “ but you must often wish it , i am sure. ” and he smiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction , that she must proceed another step .
austen	emma	“ good heaven ! ” cried mr. elton , “ what can be the meaning of this ? —miss smith ! —i never thought of miss smith in the whole course of my existence—never paid her any attentions , but as your friend : never cared whether she were dead or alive , but as your friend . if she has fancied otherwise , her own wishes have misled her , and i am very sorry—extremely sorry—but , miss smith , indeed ! —oh ! miss woodhouse ! who can think of miss smith , when miss woodhouse is near ! no , upon my honour , there is no unsteadiness of character . i have thought only of you . i protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one else . every thing that i have said or done , for many weeks past , has been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself . you can not really , seriously , doubt it . no ! — ( in an accent meant to be insinuating ) —i am sure you have seen and understood me . ”
austen	emma	“ well , papa , if this is not encouragement to marry , i do not know what is . and i should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such vanity-baits for poor young ladies . ”
austen	emma	“ for my companion tells me , ” said she , “ that i absolutely promised miss bates last night , that i would come this morning . i was not aware of it myself . i did not know that i had fixed a day , but as he says i did , i am going now . ”
austen	emma	“ well , i believe , if you will excuse me , mr. knightley , if you will not consider me as doing a very rude thing , i shall take emma ’ s advice and go out for a quarter of an hour . as the sun is out , i believe i had better take my three turns while i can . i treat you without ceremony , mr. knightley . we invalids think we are privileged people . ”
austen	emma	“ he was too good ! —she could not endure the thought ! —she would not give him such a troublesome office for the world , ” —brought on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances , —and a very few minutes settled the business .
austen	emma	her views of improving her little friend ’ s mind , by a great deal of useful reading and conversation , had never yet led to more than a few first chapters , and the intention of going on to-morrow . it was much easier to chat than to study ; much pleasanter to let her imagination range and work at harriet ’ s fortune , than to be labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts ; and the only literary pursuit which engaged harriet at present , the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life , was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with , into a thin quarto of hot-pressed paper , made up by her friend , and ornamented with ciphers and trophies .
austen	emma	seats tolerably in the shade were found ; and now emma was obliged to overhear what mrs. elton and jane fairfax were talking of.—a situation , a most desirable situation , was in question . mrs. elton had received notice of it that morning , and was in raptures . it was not with mrs. suckling , it was not with mrs. bragge , but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them : it was with a cousin of mrs. bragge , an acquaintance of mrs. suckling , a lady known at maple grove . delightful , charming , superior , first circles , spheres , lines , ranks , every thing—and mrs. elton was wild to have the offer closed with immediately.—on her side , all was warmth , energy , and triumph—and she positively refused to take her friend ’ s negative , though miss fairfax continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing , repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before.—still mrs. elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the morrow ’ s post.—how jane could bear it at all , was astonishing to emma.—she did look vexed , she did speak pointedly—and at last , with a decision of action unusual to her , proposed a removal.— “ should not they walk ? would not mr. knightley shew them the gardens—all the gardens ? —she wished to see the whole extent. ” —the pertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear .
austen	emma	“ that is a grand pianoforte , and he might think it too large for mrs. bates ’ s house. ” “ you may _say_ what you chuse—but your countenance testifies that your _thoughts_ on this subject are very much like mine . ”
austen	emma	“ yes , sir , i did indeed ; and i am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me. ” “ my dear miss fairfax , young ladies are very sure to be cared for.—i hope your good grand-mama and aunt are well . they are some of my very old friends . i wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour . you do us a great deal of honour to-day , i am sure . my daughter and i are both highly sensible of your goodness , and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at hartfield . ”
austen	emma	“ sir , ” said mr. woodhouse , rather warmly , “ you are very much mistaken if you suppose mr. perry to be that sort of character . mr. perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill . but i do not understand how the room at the crown can be safer for you than your father ’ s house . ”
austen	emma	emma wished he would be less pointed , yet could not help being amused ; and when on glancing her eye towards jane fairfax she caught the remains of a smile , when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness , there had been a smile of secret delight , she had less scruple in the amusement , and much less compunction with respect to her.—this amiable , upright , perfect jane fairfax was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings .
austen	emma	in time , of course , mr. knightley would be forgotten , that is , supplanted ; but this could not be expected to happen very early . mr. knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure ; —not like mr. elton . mr. knightley , always so kind , so feeling , so truly considerate for every body , would never deserve to be less worshipped than now ; and it really was too much to hope even of harriet , that she could be in love with more than _three_ men in one year .
austen	emma	yes , good man ! —thought emma—but what has all that to do with taking likenesses ? you know nothing of drawing . don ’ t pretend to be in raptures about mine . keep your raptures for harriet ’ s face . “ well , if you give me such kind encouragement , mr. elton , i believe i shall try what i can do . harriet ’ s features are very delicate , which makes a likeness difficult ; and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch . ”
austen	emma	“ i am glad i have done being in love with him . i should not like a man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning . harriet ’ s sweet easy temper will not mind it . ”
austen	emma	emma sat with her as long as she could , to attend her in mrs. goddard ’ s unavoidable absences , and raise her spirits by representing how much mr. elton ’ s would be depressed when he knew her state ; and left her at last tolerably comfortable , in the sweet dependence of his having a most comfortless visit , and of their all missing her very much . she had not advanced many yards from mrs. goddard ’ s door , when she was met by mr. elton himself , evidently coming towards it , and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid—of whom he , on the rumour of considerable illness , had been going to inquire , that he might carry some report of her to hartfield—they were overtaken by mr. john knightley returning from the daily visit to donwell , with his two eldest boys , whose healthy , glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run , and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for . they joined company and proceeded together . emma was just describing the nature of her friend ’ s complaint ; — “ a throat very much inflamed , with a great deal of heat about her , a quick , low pulse , & c. and she was sorry to find from mrs. goddard that harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats , and had often alarmed her with them. ” mr. elton looked all alarm on the occasion , as he exclaimed ,
austen	emma	“ your command ? —yes. ” “ perhaps i intended you to say so , but i meant self-command . you had , somehow or other , broken bounds yesterday , and run away from your own management ; but to-day you are got back again—and as i can not be always with you , it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine . ”
austen	emma	emma , alone with her father , had half her attention wanted by him while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry—and to marry strangers too—and the other half she could give to her own view of the subject . it was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece of news , as proving that mr. elton could not have suffered long ; but she was sorry for harriet : harriet must feel it—and all that she could hope was , by giving the first information herself , to save her from hearing it abruptly from others . it was now about the time that she was likely to call . if she were to meet miss bates in her way ! —and upon its beginning to rain , emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be detaining her at mrs. goddard ’ s , and that the intelligence would undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation .
austen	emma	jane fairfax had already quitted highbury , and was restored to the comforts of her beloved home with the campbells.—the mr. churchills were also in town ; and they were only waiting for november .
austen	emma	“ oh ! mr. knightley , one moment more ; something of consequence—so shocked ! —jane and i are both so shocked about the apples ! ” “ what is the matter now ? ” “ to think of your sending us all your store apples . you said you had a great many , and now you have not one left . we really are so shocked ! mrs. hodges may well be angry . william larkins mentioned it here . you should not have done it , indeed you should not . ah ! he is off . he never can bear to be thanked . but i thought he would have staid now , and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned .... well , ( returning to the room , ) i have not been able to succeed . mr. knightley can not stop . he is going to kingston . he asked me if he could do any thing .... ”
austen	emma	“ i do not offer it for miss smith ’ s collection , ” said he . “ being my friend ’ s , i have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye , but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it . ”
austen	emma	“ oh ! ” cried jane , with a blush and an hesitation which emma thought infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual composure— “ there would have been no danger . the danger would have been of my wearying you . you could not have gratified me more than by expressing an interest— . indeed , miss woodhouse , ( speaking more collectedly , ) with the consciousness which i have of misconduct , very great misconduct , it is particularly consoling to me to know that those of my friends , whose good opinion is most worth preserving , are not disgusted to such a degree as to—i have not time for half that i could wish to say . i long to make apologies , excuses , to urge something for myself . i feel it so very due . but , unfortunately—in short , if your compassion does not stand my friend— ”
austen	emma	chapter xi “ harriet , poor harriet ! ” —those were the words ; in them lay the tormenting ideas which emma could not get rid of , and which constituted the real misery of the business to her . frank churchill had behaved very ill by herself—very ill in many ways , —but it was not so much _his_ behaviour as her _own_ , which made her so angry with him . it was the scrape which he had drawn her into on harriet ’ s account , that gave the deepest hue to his offence.—poor harriet ! to be a second time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery . mr. knightley had spoken prophetically , when he once said , “ emma , you have been no friend to harriet smith. ” —she was afraid she had done her nothing but disservice.—it was true that she had not to charge herself , in this instance as in the former , with being the sole and original author of the mischief ; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered harriet ’ s imagination ; for harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of frank churchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject ; but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed . she might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments . her influence would have been enough . and now she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them.—she felt that she had been risking her friend ’ s happiness on most insufficient grounds . common sense would have directed her to tell harriet , that she must not allow herself to think of him , and that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her.— “ but , with common sense , ” she added , “ i am afraid i have had little to do . ”
austen	emma	there was no occasion to press the matter farther . the conviction seemed real ; he looked as if he felt it . she said no more , other subjects took their turn ; and the rest of the dinner passed away ; the dessert succeeded , the children came in , and were talked to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation ; a few clever things said , a few downright silly , but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the other—nothing worse than everyday remarks , dull repetitions , old news , and heavy jokes .
austen	emma	mr. and mrs. john knightley , from having been longer than usual absent from surry , were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest . till this year , every long vacation since their marriage had been divided between hartfield and donwell abbey ; but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea-bathing for the children , and it was therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their surry connexions , or seen at all by mr. woodhouse , who could not be induced to get so far as london , even for poor isabella ’ s sake ; and who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit .
austen	emma	the evening was quiet and conversable , as mr. woodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear isabella , and the little party made two natural divisions ; on one side he and his daughter ; on the other the two mr. knightleys ; their subjects totally distinct , or very rarely mixing—and emma only occasionally joining in one or the other .
austen	emma	“ there it is . there go you and your riddle-book one of these days. ” —harriet ’ s was— “ oh , what a sweet house ! —how very beautiful ! —there are the yellow curtains that miss nash admires so much . ”
austen	emma	emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from their knowing each other , which had taken strong possession of her mind , had ever crossed his ; and whether his compliments were to be considered as marks of acquiescence , or proofs of defiance . she must see more of him to understand his ways ; at present she only felt they were agreeable .
austen	emma	oh ! had she never brought harriet forward ! had she left her where she ought , and where he had told her she ought ! —had she not , with a folly which no tongue could express , prevented her marrying the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong—all would have been safe ; none of this dreadful sequel would have been .
austen	emma	“ oh , dear , ” cried harriet , “ now i recollect what you mean ; but i was thinking of something very different at the time . it was not the gipsies—it was not mr. frank churchill that i meant . no ! ( with some elevation ) i was thinking of a much more precious circumstance—of mr. knightley ’ s coming and asking me to dance , when mr. elton would not stand up with me ; and when there was no other partner in the room . that was the kind action ; that was the noble benevolence and generosity ; that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon earth . ”
austen	emma	“ no , ” said emma , laughing ; “ but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again . such language for a young man entirely dependent , to use ! —nobody but you , mr. knightley , would imagine it possible . but you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own . mr. frank churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt , who have brought him up , and are to provide for him ! —standing up in the middle of the room , i suppose , and speaking as loud as he could ! —how can you imagine such conduct practicable ? ”
austen	emma	“ aye—like maple grove , i dare say . nothing can stand more retired from the road than maple grove . such an immense plantation all round it ! you seem shut out from every thing—in the most complete retirement.—and mrs. churchill probably has not health or spirits like selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion . or , perhaps she may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life . i always say a woman can not have too many resources—and i feel very thankful that i have so many myself as to be quite independent of society . ”
austen	emma	how was she to bear the change ? —it was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them ; but emma was aware that great must be the difference between a mrs. weston , only half a mile from them , and a miss taylor in the house ; and with all her advantages , natural and domestic , she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude . she dearly loved her father , but he was no companion for her . he could not meet her in conversation , rational or playful .
austen	emma	“ i have the greatest pleasure , my dear emma , in forwarding to you the enclosed . i know what thorough justice you will do it , and have scarcely a doubt of its happy effect.—i think we shall never materially disagree about the writer again ; but i will not delay you by a long preface.—we are quite well.—this letter has been the cure of all the little nervousness i have been feeling lately.—i did not quite like your looks on tuesday , but it was an ungenial morning ; and though you will never own being affected by weather , i think every body feels a north-east wind.—i felt for your dear father very much in the storm of tuesday afternoon and yesterday morning , but had the comfort of hearing last night , by mr. perry , that it had not made him ill .
austen	emma	her sister , though comparatively but little removed by matrimony , being settled in london , only sixteen miles off , was much beyond her daily reach ; and many a long october and november evening must be struggled through at hartfield , before christmas brought the next visit from isabella and her husband , and their little children , to fill the house , and give her pleasant society again .
austen	emma	“ john enters like a brother into my happiness , ” continued mr. knightley , “ but he is no complimenter ; and though i well know him to have , likewise , a most brotherly affection for you , he is so far from making flourishes , that any other young woman might think him rather cool in her praise . but i am not afraid of your seeing what he writes . ”
austen	emma	“ you like it , my emma , as little as i feared.—i wish our opinions were the same . but in time they will . time , you may be sure , will make one or the other of us think differently ; and , in the meanwhile , we need not talk much on the subject . ”
austen	emma	thy ready wit the word will soon supply , may its approval beam in that soft eye ! she cast her eye over it , pondered , caught the meaning , read it through again to be quite certain , and quite mistress of the lines , and then passing it to harriet , sat happily smiling , and saying to herself , while harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and dulness , “ very well , mr. elton , very well indeed . i have read worse charades . _courtship_—a very good hint . i give you credit for it . this is feeling your way . this is saying very plainly— ‘ pray , miss smith , give me leave to pay my addresses to you . approve my charade and my intentions in the same glance . ’
austen	emma	mr. weston was musing . “ i hope , ” said he presently , “ i have not been severe upon poor mrs. churchill . if she is ill i should be sorry to do her injustice ; but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance i could wish . you can not be ignorant , mrs. elton , of my connexion with the family , nor of the treatment i have met with ; and , between ourselves , the whole blame of it is to be laid to her . she was the instigator . frank ’ s mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her . mr. churchill has pride ; but his pride is nothing to his wife ’ s : his is a quiet , indolent , gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody , and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome ; but her pride is arrogance and insolence ! and what inclines one less to bear , she has no fair pretence of family or blood . she was nobody when he married her , barely the daughter of a gentleman ; but ever since her being turned into a churchill she has out-churchill ’ d them all in high and mighty claims : but in herself , i assure you , she is an upstart . ”
austen	emma	emma laughed and disclaimed . he continued , “ depend upon it , elton will not do . elton is a very good sort of man , and a very respectable vicar of highbury , but not at all likely to make an imprudent match . he knows the value of a good income as well as any body . elton may talk sentimentally , but he will act rationally . he is as well acquainted with his own claims , as you can be with harriet ’ s . he knows that he is a very handsome young man , and a great favourite wherever he goes ; and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments , when there are only men present , i am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away . i have heard him speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with , who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece . ”
austen	emma	in spite of her vexation , she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous , that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to perform by harriet , which mrs. weston had just gone through by herself . the intelligence , which had been so anxiously announced to her , she was now to be anxiously announcing to another . her heart beat quick on hearing harriet ’ s footstep and voice ; so , she supposed , had poor mrs. weston felt when _she_ was approaching randalls . could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance ! —but of that , unfortunately , there could be no chance .
austen	emma	frank churchill placed a word before miss fairfax . she gave a slight glance round the table , and applied herself to it . frank was next to emma , jane opposite to them—and mr. knightley so placed as to see them all ; and it was his object to see as much as he could , with as little apparent observation . the word was discovered , and with a faint smile pushed away . if meant to be immediately mixed with the others , and buried from sight , she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across , for it was not mixed ; and harriet , eager after every fresh word , and finding out none , directly took it up , and fell to work . she was sitting by mr. knightley , and turned to him for help . the word was _blunder_ ; and as harriet exultingly proclaimed it , there was a blush on jane ’ s cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible . mr. knightley connected it with the dream ; but how it could all be , was beyond his comprehension . how the delicacy , the discretion of his favourite could have been so lain asleep ! he feared there must be some decided involvement . disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn . these letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick . it was a child ’ s play , chosen to conceal a deeper game on frank churchill ’ s part .
austen	emma	all this ran so glibly through her thoughts , that by the time her father had arranged himself , after the bustle of the eltons ’ departure , and was ready to speak , she was very tolerably capable of attending .
austen	emma	“ trouble ! aye , i know your scruples . you are afraid of giving me trouble ; but i assure you , my dear jane , the campbells can hardly be more interested about you than i am . i shall write to mrs. partridge in a day or two , and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look-out for any thing eligible . ”
austen	emma	“ but , my dear papa , it is supposed to be summer ; a warm day in summer . look at the tree. ” “ but it is never safe to sit out of doors , my dear . ”
austen	emma	this was not submitted to by either lady . they vindicated him against the base aspersion . “ no , it by no means wanted strength—it was not a large hand , but very clear and certainly strong . had not mrs. weston any letter about her to produce ? ” no , she had heard from him very lately , but having answered the letter , had put it away .
austen	emma	“ ah ! mr. knightley , why do not you stay at home like poor mr. elton ? ” these days of confinement would have been , but for her private perplexities , remarkably comfortable , as such seclusion exactly suited her brother , whose feelings must always be of great importance to his companions ; and he had , besides , so thoroughly cleared off his ill-humour at randalls , that his amiableness never failed him during the rest of his stay at hartfield . he was always agreeable and obliging , and speaking pleasantly of every body . but with all the hopes of cheerfulness , and all the present comfort of delay , there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with harriet , as made it impossible for emma to be ever perfectly at ease .
austen	emma	“ whoever colonel campbell might employ , ” said frank churchill , with a smile at emma , “ the person has not chosen ill . i heard a good deal of colonel campbell ’ s taste at weymouth ; and the softness of the upper notes i am sure is exactly what he and _all_ _that_ _party_ would particularly prize . i dare say , miss fairfax , that he either gave his friend very minute directions , or wrote to broadwood himself . do not you think so ? ”
austen	emma	she had no difficulty in procuring isabella ’ s invitation ; and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it , without resorting to invention.—there was a tooth amiss . harriet really wished , and had wished some time , to consult a dentist . mrs. john knightley was delighted to be of use ; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to her—and though not so fond of a dentist as of a mr. wingfield , she was quite eager to have harriet under her care.—when it was thus settled on her sister ’ s side , emma proposed it to her friend , and found her very persuadable.—harriet was to go ; she was invited for at least a fortnight ; she was to be conveyed in mr. woodhouse ’ s carriage.—it was all arranged , it was all completed , and harriet was safe in brunswick square .
austen	emma	“ oh yes , papa . i have no fears at all for myself ; and i should have no scruples of staying as late as mrs. weston , but on your account . i am only afraid of your sitting up for me . i am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with mrs. goddard . she loves piquet , you know ; but when she is gone home , i am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself , instead of going to bed at your usual time—and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort . you must promise me not to sit up . ”
austen	emma	“ your father will not be easy ; why do not you go ? ” “ i am ready , if the others are. ” “ shall i ring the bell ? ” “ yes , do. ” and the bell was rung , and the carriages spoken for . a few minutes more , and emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own house , to get sober and cool , and the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over .
austen	emma	“ and mrs. perry and the children , how are they ? do the children grow ? i have a great regard for mr. perry . i hope he will be calling soon . he will be so pleased to see my little ones . ”
austen	emma	jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour , and they had only accomplished some views of st. mark ’ s place , venice , when frank churchill entered the room . emma had not been thinking of him , she had forgotten to think of him—but she was very glad to see him . mrs. weston would be at ease . the black mare was blameless ; _they_ were right who had named mrs. churchill as the cause . he had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her ; a nervous seizure , which had lasted some hours—and he had quite given up every thought of coming , till very late ; —and had he known how hot a ride he should have , and how late , with all his hurry , he must be , he believed he should not have come at all . the heat was excessive ; he had never suffered any thing like it—almost wished he had staid at home—nothing killed him like heat—he could bear any degree of cold , etc. , but heat was intolerable—and he sat down , at the greatest possible distance from the slight remains of mr. woodhouse ’ s fire , looking very deplorable .
austen	emma	volume i chapter i emma woodhouse , handsome , clever , and rich , with a comfortable home and happy disposition , seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence ; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her .
austen	emma	“ perhaps you think i am come on purpose to quarrel with you , knowing weston to be out , and that you must still fight your own battle. ” “ mr . weston would undoubtedly support me , if he were here , for he thinks exactly as i do on the subject . we were speaking of it only yesterday , and agreeing how fortunate it was for emma , that there should be such a girl in highbury for her to associate with . mr. knightley , i shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case . you are so much used to live alone , that you do not know the value of a companion ; and , perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex , after being used to it all her life . i can imagine your objection to harriet smith . she is not the superior young woman which emma ’ s friend ought to be . but on the other hand , as emma wants to see her better informed , it will be an inducement to her to read more herself . they will read together . she means it , i know . ”
austen	emma	emma denied none of it aloud , and agreed to none of it in private . it was now the middle of june , and the weather fine ; and mrs. elton was growing impatient to name the day , and settle with mr. weston as to pigeon-pies and cold lamb , when a lame carriage-horse threw every thing into sad uncertainty . it might be weeks , it might be only a few days , before the horse were useable ; but no preparations could be ventured on , and it was all melancholy stagnation . mrs. elton ’ s resources were inadequate to such an attack .
austen	emma	she went , however ; and when they reached the farm , and she was to be put down , at the end of the broad , neat gravel walk , which led between espalier apple-trees to the front door , the sight of every thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before , was beginning to revive a little local agitation ; and when they parted , emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity , which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour . she went on herself , to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married , and settled in donwell .
austen	emma	she was stopped by a slight fit of coughing , and mr. weston instantly seized the opportunity of going on . “ you were mentioning may . may is the very month which mrs. churchill is ordered , or has ordered herself , to spend in some warmer place than enscombe—in short , to spend in london ; so that we have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from frank the whole spring—precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen for it : days almost at the longest ; weather genial and pleasant , always inviting one out , and never too hot for exercise . when he was here before , we made the best of it ; but there was a good deal of wet , damp , cheerless weather ; there always is in february , you know , and we could not do half that we intended . now will be the time . this will be complete enjoyment ; and i do not know , mrs. elton , whether the uncertainty of our meetings , the sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to-day or to-morrow , and at any hour , may not be more friendly to happiness than having him actually in the house . i think it is so . i think it is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight . i hope you will be pleased with my son ; but you must not expect a prodigy . he is generally thought a fine young man , but do not expect a prodigy . mrs. weston ’ s partiality for him is very great , and , as you may suppose , most gratifying to me . she thinks nobody equal to him . ”
austen	emma	emma had feelings , less of curiosity than of pride or propriety , to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects ; and she made a point of harriet ’ s going with her , that the worst of the business might be gone through as soon as possible .
austen	emma	mrs. weston said no more ; and emma could imagine with what surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat . this was mr. elton ! the amiable , obliging , gentle mr. elton.—she looked round for a moment ; he had joined mr. knightley at a little distance , and was arranging himself for settled conversation , while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife .
austen	emma	emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting . it had been serviceable in deadening the first shock , without retaining any influence to alarm . as harriet now lived , the martins could not get at her , without seeking her , where hitherto they had wanted either the courage or the condescension to seek her ; for since her refusal of the brother , the sisters never had been at mrs. goddard ’ s ; and a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again , with any necessity , or even any power of speech .
austen	emma	she comforted her father better than she could comfort herself , by representing that though he certainly would make them nine , yet he always said so little , that the increase of noise would be very immaterial . she thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself , to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her instead of his brother .
austen	emma	mrs. weston proposed having no regular supper ; merely sandwiches , & c. , set out in the little room ; but that was scouted as a wretched suggestion . a private dance , without sitting down to supper , was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women ; and mrs. weston must not speak of it again . she then took another line of expediency , and looking into the doubtful room , observed ,
austen	emma	“ no—mrs . knightley ; —and till she is in being , i will manage such matters myself. ” “ ah ! you are an odd creature ! ” she cried , satisfied to have no one preferred to herself.— “ you are a humourist , and may say what you like . quite a humourist . well , i shall bring jane with me—jane and her aunt.—the rest i leave to you . i have no objections at all to meeting the hartfield family . don ’ t scruple . i know you are attached to them . ”
austen	emma	he was invited on good faith . no lurking horrors were to upbraid him for his easy credulity . he did consent . he had not been at donwell for two years . “ some very fine morning , he , and emma , and harriet , could go very well ; and he could sit still with mrs. weston , while the dear girls walked about the gardens . he did not suppose they could be damp now , in the middle of the day . he should like to see the old house again exceedingly , and should be very happy to meet mr. and mrs. elton , and any other of his neighbours.—he could not see any objection at all to his , and emma ’ s , and harriet ’ s going there some very fine morning . he thought it very well done of mr. knightley to invite them—very kind and sensible—much cleverer than dining out.—he was not fond of dining out . ”
austen	emma	“ yes , very true , ” cried frank , “ very true . you want your neighbours ’ opinions . i do not wonder at you . if one could ascertain what the chief of them—the coles , for instance . they are not far off . shall i call upon them ? or miss bates ? she is still nearer.—and i do not know whether miss bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body . i think we do want a larger council . suppose i go and invite miss bates to join us ? ”
austen	emma	emma had no longer an alarm for henry ; his interest was yet safe ; and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment . not more than five couple could be mustered ; but the rarity and the suddenness of it made it very delightful , and she found herself well matched in a partner . they were a couple worth looking at .
austen	emma	“ it would be very hard , indeed , my dear , if poor isabella were to be anywhere but at hartfield. ” mr. woodhouse could never allow for mr. knightley ’ s claims on his brother , or any body ’ s claims on isabella , except his own . he sat musing a little while , and then said ,
austen	emma	their being fixed , so absolutely fixed , in the same place , was bad for each , for all three . not one of them had the power of removal , or of effecting any material change of society . they must encounter each other , and make the best of it .
austen	emma	“ what is this ? —what is this ? ” cried mr. weston , “ about perry and a carriage ? is perry going to set up his carriage , frank ? i am glad he can afford it . you had it from himself , had you ? ”
austen	emma	“ nonsensical girl ! ” was his reply , but not at all in anger . emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as with mr. knightley . she was received with a cordial respect which could not but please , and given all the consequence she could wish for . when the westons arrived , the kindest looks of love , the strongest of admiration were for her , from both husband and wife ; the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object , and at dinner she found him seated by her—and , as she firmly believed , not without some dexterity on his side .
austen	emma	“ may i , indeed ? —then i will speak the truth , and nothing suits me so well . i met her frequently at weymouth . i had known the campbells a little in town ; and at weymouth we were very much in the same set . colonel campbell is a very agreeable man , and mrs. campbell a friendly , warm-hearted woman . i like them all . ”
austen	emma	harriet submitted , though her mind could hardly separate the parts , so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a declaration of love . it seemed too precious an offering for any degree of publicity .
austen	emma	“ i was going to observe , sir , ” said frank churchill , “ that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body ’ s catching cold—so much less danger at the crown than at randalls ! mr. perry might have reason to regret the alteration , but nobody else could . ”
austen	emma	soon after this miss bates came in , and emma could not help being diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself , resulting , she supposed , from doubt of what might be said , and impatience to say every thing .
austen	emma	the joy , the gratitude , the exquisite delight of her sensations may be imagined . the sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of harriet ’ s welfare , she was really in danger of becoming too happy for security.—what had she to wish for ? nothing , but to grow more worthy of him , whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own . nothing , but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future .
austen	emma	“ he appears rough to you , ” said emma , “ because you are so very gentle yourself ; but if you could compare him with other papas , you would not think him rough . he wishes his boys to be active and hardy ; and if they misbehave , can give them a sharp word now and then ; but he is an affectionate father—certainly mr. john knightley is an affectionate father . the children are all fond of him . ”
austen	emma	the next remove was to the house ; they must all go in and eat ; —and they were all seated and busy , and still frank churchill did not come . mrs. weston looked , and looked in vain . his father would not own himself uneasy , and laughed at her fears ; but she could not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare . he had expressed himself as to coming , with more than common certainty . “ his aunt was so much better , that he had not a doubt of getting over to them. ” —mrs . churchill ’ s state , however , as many were ready to remind her , was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable dependence—and mrs. weston was at last persuaded to believe , or to say , that it must be by some attack of mrs. churchill that he was prevented coming.—emma looked at harriet while the point was under consideration ; she behaved very well , and betrayed no emotion .
austen	emma	“ have not you mistaken the day ? ” said emma . “ i am almost certain that the meeting at the crown is not till to-morrow.—mr . knightley was at hartfield yesterday , and spoke of it as for saturday . ”
austen	emma	the like reserve prevailed on other topics . she and mr. frank churchill had been at weymouth at the same time . it was known that they were a little acquainted ; but not a syllable of real information could emma procure as to what he truly was . “ was he handsome ? ” — “ she believed he was reckoned a very fine young man. ” “ was he agreeable ? ” — “ he was generally thought so. ” “ did he appear a sensible young man ; a young man of information ? ” — “ at a watering-place , or in a common london acquaintance , it was difficult to decide on such points . manners were all that could be safely judged of , under a much longer knowledge than they had yet had of mr. churchill . she believed every body found his manners pleasing. ” emma could not forgive her .
austen	emma	“ i never should have presumed to think of it at first , ” said she , “ but for you . you told me to observe him carefully , and let his behaviour be the rule of mine—and so i have . but now i seem to feel that i may deserve him ; and that if he does chuse me , it will not be any thing so very wonderful . ”
austen	emma	“ it is so cold , so very cold—and looks and feels so very much like snow , that if it were to any other place or with any other party , i should really try not to go out to-day—and dissuade my father from venturing ; but as he has made up his mind , and does not seem to feel the cold himself , i do not like to interfere , as i know it would be so great a disappointment to mr. and mrs. weston . but , upon my word , mr. elton , in your case , i should certainly excuse myself . you appear to me a little hoarse already , and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to-morrow will bring , i think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to-night . ”
austen	emma	she was not to see frank churchill this morning . he had told her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at hartfield , as he was to be at home by the middle of the day . she did not regret it .
austen	emma	this was the occurrence : —the coles had been settled some years in highbury , and were very good sort of people—friendly , liberal , and unpretending ; but , on the other hand , they were of low origin , in trade , and only moderately genteel . on their first coming into the country , they had lived in proportion to their income , quietly , keeping little company , and that little unexpensively ; but the last year or two had brought them a considerable increase of means—the house in town had yielded greater profits , and fortune in general had smiled on them . with their wealth , their views increased ; their want of a larger house , their inclination for more company . they added to their house , to their number of servants , to their expenses of every sort ; and by this time were , in fortune and style of living , second only to the family at hartfield . their love of society , and their new dining-room , prepared every body for their keeping dinner-company ; and a few parties , chiefly among the single men , had already taken place . the regular and best families emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite—neither donwell , nor hartfield , nor randalls . nothing should tempt _her_ to go , if they did ; and she regretted that her father ’ s known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish . the coles were very respectable in their way , but they ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit them . this lesson , she very much feared , they would receive only from herself ; she had little hope of mr. knightley , none of mr. weston .
austen	emma	chapter ix emma ’ s pensive meditations , as she walked home , were not interrupted ; but on entering the parlour , she found those who must rouse her . mr. knightley and harriet had arrived during her absence , and were sitting with her father.—mr . knightley immediately got up , and in a manner decidedly graver than usual , said ,
austen	emma	“ my picture ! —but he has left my picture in bond-street. ” “ has he so ! —then i know nothing of mr. elton . no , my dear little modest harriet , depend upon it the picture will not be in bond-street till just before he mounts his horse to-morrow . it is his companion all this evening , his solace , his delight . it opens his designs to his family , it introduces you among them , it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature , eager curiosity and warm prepossession . how cheerful , how animated , how suspicious , how busy their imaginations all are ! ”
austen	emma	the next thing wanted was to get the picture framed ; and here were a few difficulties . it must be done directly ; it must be done in london ; the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste could be depended on ; and isabella , the usual doer of all commissions , must not be applied to , because it was december , and mr. woodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs of december . but no sooner was the distress known to mr. elton , than it was removed . his gallantry was always on the alert . “ might he be trusted with the commission , what infinite pleasure should he have in executing it ! he could ride to london at any time . it was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being employed on such an errand . ”
austen	emma	“ i do not believe any such thing , ” replied emma.— “ i am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours , when it is necessary ; but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent . quite otherwise indeed , if i understood miss fairfax ’ s opinion last night . ”
austen	emma	“ come , come , ” cried emma , feeling this to be an unsafe subject , “ i must beg you not to talk of the sea . it makes me envious and miserable ; —i who have never seen it ! south end is prohibited , if you please . my dear isabella , i have not heard you make one inquiry about mr. perry yet ; and he never forgets you . ”
austen	emma	the son looked convinced . “ i have heard her speak of the acquaintance , ” said emma ; “ she is a very elegant young woman. ” he agreed to it , but with so quiet a “ yes , ” as inclined her almost to doubt his real concurrence ; and yet there must be a very distinct sort of elegance for the fashionable world , if jane fairfax could be thought only ordinarily gifted with it .
austen	emma	he was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal , and came back all the better—grown quite cool—and , with good manners , like himself—able to draw a chair close to them , take an interest in their employment ; and regret , in a reasonable way , that he should be so late . he was not in his best spirits , but seemed trying to improve them ; and , at last , made himself talk nonsense very agreeably . they were looking over views in swisserland .
austen	emma	and again , on emma ’ s merely turning her head to look at mrs. bates ’ s knitting , she added , in a half whisper , “ i mentioned no _names_ , you will observe.—oh ! no ; cautious as a minister of state . i managed it extremely well . ”
austen	emma	“ to be sure—our discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong. ” “ yes , ” said he , smiling— “ and reason good . i was sixteen years old when you were born. ” “ a material difference then , ” she replied— “ and no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives ; but does not the lapse of one-and-twenty years bring our understandings a good deal nearer ? ”
austen	emma	“ quite wrong , my dear aunt ; there is no likeness at all. ” “ very odd ! but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand . one takes up a notion , and runs away with it . mr. dixon , you say , is not , strictly speaking , handsome ? ”
austen	emma	a complete change of life became desirable . he quitted the militia and engaged in trade , having brothers already established in a good way in london , which afforded him a favourable opening . it was a concern which brought just employment enough . he had still a small house in highbury , where most of his leisure days were spent ; and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society , the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away . he had , by that time , realised an easy competence—enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining highbury , which he had always longed for—enough to marry a woman as portionless even as miss taylor , and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition .
austen	emma	“ pray , emma , ” said he , “ may i ask in what lay the great amusement , the poignant sting of the last word given to you and miss fairfax ? i saw the word , and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one , and so very distressing to the other . ”
austen	emma	“ mr . elton is a very pretty young man , to be sure , and a very good young man , and i have a great regard for him . but if you want to shew him any attention , my dear , ask him to come and dine with us some day . that will be a much better thing . i dare say mr. knightley will be so kind as to meet him . ”
austen	emma	“ here is april come ! ” said she , “ i get quite anxious about you . june will soon be here. ” “ but i have never fixed on june or any other month—merely looked forward to the summer in general . ”
austen	emma	“ oh no ; —and it is but a short letter too. ” emma felt the bad taste of her friend , but let it pass with a “ very true ; and it would be a small consolation to her , for the clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day , to know that her husband could write a good letter . ”
austen	emma	with tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again , and for a longer time than hitherto ; of judging of his general manners , and by inference , of the meaning of his manners towards herself ; of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air ; and of fancying what the observations of all those might be , who were now seeing them together for the first time .
austen	emma	“ thank you . i should be mortified indeed if i did not believe i had been of some use ; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may . _you_ do not often overpower me with it . ”
austen	emma	anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could , she soon afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath , a little raised on one side of the lane , leaving them together in the main road . but she had not been there two minutes when she found that harriet ’ s habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too , and that , in short , they would both be soon after her . this would not do ; she immediately stopped , under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her half-boot , and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath , begged them to have the goodness to walk on , and she would follow in half a minute . they did as they were desired ; and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot , she had the comfort of farther delay in her power , being overtaken by a child from the cottage , setting out , according to orders , with her pitcher , to fetch broth from hartfield . to walk by the side of this child , and talk to and question her , was the most natural thing in the world , or would have been the most natural , had she been acting just then without design ; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead , without any obligation of waiting for her . she gained on them , however , involuntarily : the child ’ s pace was quick , and theirs rather slow ; and she was the more concerned at it , from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them . mr. elton was speaking with animation , harriet listening with a very pleased attention ; and emma , having sent the child on , was beginning to think how she might draw back a little more , when they both looked around , and she was obliged to join them .
austen	emma	“ you seem to me to have forgotten mrs. and miss bates , ” said emma , “ i have not heard one inquiry after them. ” “ oh ! the good bateses—i am quite ashamed of myself—but you mention them in most of your letters . i hope they are quite well . good old mrs. bates—i will call upon her to-morrow , and take my children.—they are always so pleased to see my children.—and that excellent miss bates ! —such thorough worthy people ! —how are they , sir ? ”
austen	emma	“ now , ” said harriet , “ you _must_ recollect. ” “ no , indeed i do not. ” “ dear me ! i should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court-plaister , one of the very last times we ever met in it ! —it was but a very few days before i had my sore throat—just before mr. and mrs. john knightley came—i think the very evening.—do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife , and your recommending court-plaister ? —but , as you had none about you , and knew i had , you desired me to supply him ; and so i took mine out and cut him a piece ; but it was a great deal too large , and he cut it smaller , and kept playing some time with what was left , before he gave it back to me . and so then , in my nonsense , i could not help making a treasure of it—so i put it by never to be used , and looked at it now and then as a great treat . ”
austen	emma	“ you are right , mrs. weston , ” said mr. knightley warmly , “ miss fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of mrs. elton . could she have chosen with whom to associate , she would not have chosen her . but ( with a reproachful smile at emma ) she receives attentions from mrs. elton , which nobody else pays her . ”
austen	emma	emma was extremely gratified.—they were interrupted by the bustle of mr. weston calling on every body to begin dancing again . “ come miss woodhouse , miss otway , miss fairfax , what are you all doing ? —come emma , set your companions the example . every body is lazy ! every body is asleep ! ”
austen	emma	“ ah ! ” he cried , “ i wish your father might be half as easily convinced as john will be , of our having every right that equal worth can give , to be happy together . i am amused by one part of john ’ s letter—did you notice it ? —where he says , that my information did not take him wholly by surprize , that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind . ”
austen	emma	a little curiosity emma had ; and she made the most of it while her friend related . mrs. weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation herself ; and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present , to be allowed merely to write to miss fairfax instead , and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed , and mr. churchill could be reconciled to the engagement ’ s becoming known ; as , considering every thing , she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports : —but mr. weston had thought differently ; he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to miss fairfax and her family , and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it ; or if it were , that it would be of any consequence ; for “ such things , ” he observed , “ always got about. ” emma smiled , and felt that mr. weston had very good reason for saying so . they had gone , in short—and very great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady . she had hardly been able to speak a word , and every look and action had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness . the quiet , heart-felt satisfaction of the old lady , and the rapturous delight of her daughter—who proved even too joyous to talk as usual , had been a gratifying , yet almost an affecting , scene . they were both so truly respectable in their happiness , so disinterested in every sensation ; thought so much of jane ; so much of every body , and so little of themselves , that every kindly feeling was at work for them . miss fairfax ’ s recent illness had offered a fair plea for mrs. weston to invite her to an airing ; she had drawn back and declined at first , but , on being pressed had yielded ; and , in the course of their drive , mrs. weston had , by gentle encouragement , overcome so much of her embarrassment , as to bring her to converse on the important subject . apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception , and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and mr. weston , must necessarily open the cause ; but when these effusions were put by , they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement . mrs. weston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her companion , pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been , and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject .
austen	emma	emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on mr. weston , and had half a mind to take it up ; but she struggled , and let it pass . she would keep the peace if possible ; and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits , the all-sufficiency of home to himself , whence resulted her brother ’ s disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse , and those to whom it was important.—it had a high claim to forbearance .
austen	emma	“ oh ! no , indeed ; i must protest against any such idea . a superior performer ! —very far from it , i assure you . consider from how partial a quarter your information came . i am doatingly fond of music—passionately fond ; —and my friends say i am not entirely devoid of taste ; but as to any thing else , upon my honour my performance is _mediocre_ to the last degree . you , miss woodhouse , i well know , play delightfully . i assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction , comfort , and delight to me , to hear what a musical society i am got into . i absolutely can not do without music . it is a necessary of life to me ; and having always been used to a very musical society , both at maple grove and in bath , it would have been a most serious sacrifice . i honestly said as much to mr. e. when he was speaking of my future home , and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable ; and the inferiority of the house too—knowing what i had been accustomed to—of course he was not wholly without apprehension . when he was speaking of it in that way , i honestly said that _the_ _world_ i could give up—parties , balls , plays—for i had no fear of retirement . blessed with so many resources within myself , the world was not necessary to _me_ . i could do very well without it . to those who had no resources it was a different thing ; but my resources made me quite independent . and as to smaller-sized rooms than i had been used to , i really could not give it a thought . i hoped i was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description . certainly i had been accustomed to every luxury at maple grove ; but i did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness , nor were spacious apartments . ‘ but , ’ said i , ‘ to be quite honest , i do not think i can live without something of a musical society . i condition for nothing else ; but without music , life would be a blank to me . ’ ”
austen	emma	she paused a few moments . emma could not speak . “ i do not wonder , miss woodhouse , ” she resumed , “ that you should feel a great difference between the two , as to me or as to any body . you must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other . but i hope , miss woodhouse , that supposing—that if—strange as it may appear— . but you know they were your own words , that _more_ wonderful things had happened , matches of _greater_ disparity had taken place than between mr. frank churchill and me ; and , therefore , it seems as if such a thing even as this , may have occurred before—and if i should be so fortunate , beyond expression , as to—if mr. knightley should really—if _he_ does not mind the disparity , i hope , dear miss woodhouse , you will not set yourself against it , and try to put difficulties in the way . but you are too good for that , i am sure . ”
austen	emma	the shower was heavy , but short ; and it had not been over five minutes , when in came harriet , with just the heated , agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give ; and the “ oh ! miss woodhouse , what do you think has happened ! ” which instantly burst forth , had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation . as the blow was given , emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in listening ; and harriet , unchecked , ran eagerly through what she had to tell . “ she had set out from mrs. goddard ’ s half an hour ago—she had been afraid it would rain—she had been afraid it would pour down every moment—but she thought she might get to hartfield first—she had hurried on as fast as possible ; but then , as she was passing by the house where a young woman was making up a gown for her , she thought she would just step in and see how it went on ; and though she did not seem to stay half a moment there , soon after she came out it began to rain , and she did not know what to do ; so she ran on directly , as fast as she could , and took shelter at ford ’ s. ” —ford ’ s was the principal woollen-draper , linen-draper , and haberdasher ’ s shop united ; the shop first in size and fashion in the place.— “ and so , there she had set , without an idea of any thing in the world , full ten minutes , perhaps—when , all of a sudden , who should come in—to be sure it was so very odd ! —but they always dealt at ford ’ s—who should come in , but elizabeth martin and her brother ! —dear miss woodhouse ! only think . i thought i should have fainted . i did not know what to do . i was sitting near the door—elizabeth saw me directly ; but he did not ; he was busy with the umbrella . i am sure she saw me , but she looked away directly , and took no notice ; and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop ; and i kept sitting near the door ! —oh ! dear ; i was so miserable ! i am sure i must have been as white as my gown . i could not go away you know , because of the rain ; but i did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there.—oh ! dear , miss woodhouse—well , at last , i fancy , he looked round and saw me ; for instead of going on with her buyings , they began whispering to one another . i am sure they were talking of me ; and i could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me— ( do you think he was , miss woodhouse ? ) —for presently she came forward—came quite up to me , and asked me how i did , and seemed ready to shake hands , if i would . she did not do any of it in the same way that she used ; i could see she was altered ; but , however , she seemed to _try_ to be very friendly , and we shook hands , and stood talking some time ; but i know no more what i said—i was in such a tremble ! —i remember she said she was sorry we never met now ; which i thought almost too kind ! dear , miss woodhouse , i was absolutely miserable ! by that time , it was beginning to hold up , and i was determined that nothing should stop me from getting away—and then—only think ! —i found he was coming up towards me too—slowly you know , and as if he did not quite know what to do ; and so he came and spoke , and i answered—and i stood for a minute , feeling dreadfully , you know , one can ’ t tell how ; and then i took courage , and said it did not rain , and i must go ; and so off i set ; and i had not got three yards from the door , when he came after me , only to say , if i was going to hartfield , he thought i had much better go round by mr. cole ’ s stables , for i should find the near way quite floated by this rain . oh ! dear , i thought it would have been the death of me ! so i said , i was very much obliged to him : you know i could not do less ; and then he went back to elizabeth , and i came round by the stables—i believe i did—but i hardly knew where i was , or any thing about it . oh ! miss woodhouse , i would rather done any thing than have it happen : and yet , you know , there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly . and elizabeth , too . oh ! miss woodhouse , do talk to me and make me comfortable again . ”
austen	emma	voices approached the shop—or rather one voice and two ladies : mrs. weston and miss bates met them at the door . “ my dear miss woodhouse , ” said the latter , “ i am just run across to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while , and give us your opinion of our new instrument ; you and miss smith . how do you do , miss smith ? —very well i thank you.—and i begged mrs. weston to come with me , that i might be sure of succeeding . ”
austen	emma	of their all removing to donwell , emma had already had her own passing thoughts . like him , she had tried the scheme and rejected it ; but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her . she was sensible of all the affection it evinced . she felt that , in quitting donwell , he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits ; that in living constantly with her father , and in no house of his own , there would be much , very much , to be borne with . she promised to think of it , and advised him to think of it more ; but he was fully convinced , that no reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject . he had given it , he could assure her , very long and calm consideration ; he had been walking away from william larkins the whole morning , to have his thoughts to himself .
austen	emma	mr. elton was so hot and tired , that all this wit seemed thrown away . his civilities to the other ladies must be paid ; but his subsequent object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering , and the walk he had had for nothing .
austen	emma	‘ full many a flower is born to blush unseen , ‘ and waste its fragrance on the desert air. ’ we must not allow them to be verified in sweet jane fairfax. ” “ i can not think there is any danger of it , ” was emma ’ s calm answer— “ and when you are better acquainted with miss fairfax ’ s situation and understand what her home has been , with colonel and mrs. campbell , i have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown . ”
austen	emma	emma listened , and then coolly said , “ i shall not be satisfied , unless he comes. ” “ he may have a great deal of influence on some points , ” continued mrs. weston , “ and on others , very little : and among those , on which she is beyond his reach , it is but too likely , may be this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us . ”
austen	emma	in half a minute they were in the room . emma was extremely glad to see him—but there was a degree of confusion—a number of embarrassing recollections on each side . they met readily and smiling , but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said ; and having all sat down again , there was for some time such a blank in the circle , that emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged , which she had long felt , of seeing frank churchill once more , and of seeing him with jane , would yield its proportion of pleasure . when mr. weston joined the party , however , and when the baby was fetched , there was no longer a want of subject or animation—or of courage and opportunity for frank churchill to draw near her and say ,
austen	emma	“ if so , you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _mr_ . dixon in them. ” “ mr . dixon.—very well . yes , i immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of mr. and mrs. dixon . we were speaking the other day , you know , of his being so warm an admirer of her performance . ”
austen	emma	isabella stept in after her father ; john knightley , forgetting that he did not belong to their party , stept in after his wife very naturally ; so that emma found , on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by mr. elton , that the door was to be lawfully shut on them , and that they were to have a tête-à-tête drive . it would not have been the awkwardness of a moment , it would have been rather a pleasure , previous to the suspicions of this very day ; she could have talked to him of harriet , and the three-quarters of a mile would have seemed but one . but now , she would rather it had not happened . she believed he had been drinking too much of mr. weston ’ s good wine , and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense .
austen	emma	there was a bustle on her approach ; a good deal of moving and talking . she heard miss bates ’ s voice , something was to be done in a hurry ; the maid looked frightened and awkward ; hoped she would be pleased to wait a moment , and then ushered her in too soon . the aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room . jane she had a distinct glimpse of , looking extremely ill ; and , before the door had shut them out , she heard miss bates saying , “ well , my dear , i shall _say_ you are laid down upon the bed , and i am sure you are ill enough . ”
austen	emma	“ aye , we men are sad fellows . you must take care of yourself , mrs. elton.—this letter tells us—it is a short letter—written in a hurry , merely to give us notice—it tells us that they are all coming up to town directly , on mrs. churchill ’ s account—she has not been well the whole winter , and thinks enscombe too cold for her—so they are all to move southward without loss of time . ”
austen	emma	“ i know you , i know you ; you would take up with any thing ; but i shall be a little more nice , and i am sure the good campbells will be quite on my side ; with your superior talents , you have a right to move in the first circle . your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms , have as many rooms as you like , and mix in the family as much as you chose ; —that is—i do not know—if you knew the harp , you might do all that , i am very sure ; but you sing as well as play ; —yes , i really believe you might , even without the harp , stipulate for what you chose ; —and you must and shall be delightfully , honourably and comfortably settled before the campbells or i have any rest . ”
austen	emma	“ our poor ball must be quite given up. ” “ ah ! that ball ! —why did we wait for any thing ? —why not seize the pleasure at once ? —how often is happiness destroyed by preparation , foolish preparation ! —you told us it would be so.—oh ! miss woodhouse , why are you always so right ? ”
austen	emma	emma ’ s colour was heightened by this unjust praise ; and with a smile , and shake of the head , which spoke much , she looked at mr. knightley.—it seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour , as if his eyes received the truth from hers , and all that had passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured.— he looked at her with a glow of regard . she was warmly gratified—and in another moment still more so , by a little movement of more than common friendliness on his part.—he took her hand ; —whether she had not herself made the first motion , she could not say—she might , perhaps , have rather offered it—but he took her hand , pressed it , and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips—when , from some fancy or other , he suddenly let it go.—why he should feel such a scruple , why he should change his mind when it was all but done , she could not perceive.—he would have judged better , she thought , if he had not stopped.—the intention , however , was indubitable ; and whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry , or however else it happened , but she thought nothing became him more.—it was with him , of so simple , yet so dignified a nature.—she could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction . it spoke such perfect amity.—he left them immediately afterwards—gone in a moment . he always moved with the alertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory , but now he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance .
austen	emma	“ i am perfectly satisfied , ” replied emma , with the brightest smiles , “ and most sincerely wish them happy. ” “ you are materially changed since we talked on this subject before. ” “ i hope so—for at that time i was a fool . ”
austen	emma	“ and while mrs. weston pays her visit , i may be allowed , i hope , ” said frank churchill , “ to join your party and wait for her at hartfield—if you are going home . ”
austen	emma	“ it is not now worth a regret , ” said emma . “ i have some hope , ” resumed he , “ of my uncle ’ s being persuaded to pay a visit at randalls ; he wants to be introduced to her . when the campbells are returned , we shall meet them in london , and continue there , i trust , till we may carry her northward.—but now , i am at such a distance from her—is not it hard , miss woodhouse ? —till this morning , we have not once met since the day of reconciliation . do not you pity me ? ”
austen	emma	upon the whole , emma left her with such softened , charitable feelings , as made her look around in walking home , and lament that highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence ; nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her .
austen	emma	emma was most happy to be called to such a council ; and her father , engaging to think it all over while she was gone , the two young people set off together without delay for the crown . there were mr. and mrs. weston ; delighted to see her and receive her approbation , very busy and very happy in their different way ; she , in some little distress ; and he , finding every thing perfect .
austen	emma	“ oh ! for myself , i protest i must be excused , ” said mrs. elton ; “ _i_ really can not attempt—i am not at all fond of the sort of thing . i had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name , which i was not at all pleased with . i knew who it came from . an abominable puppy ! —you know who i mean ( nodding to her husband ) . these kind of things are very well at christmas , when one is sitting round the fire ; but quite out of place , in my opinion , when one is exploring about the country in summer . miss woodhouse must excuse me . i am not one of those who have witty things at every body ’ s service . i do not pretend to be a wit . i have a great deal of vivacity in my own way , but i really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue . pass us , if you please , mr. churchill . pass mr. e. , knightley , jane , and myself . we have nothing clever to say—not one of us .
austen	emma	“ my poor dear harriet ! and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things ? ” “ yes , simpleton as i was ! —but i am quite ashamed of it now , and wish i could forget as easily as i can burn them . it was very wrong of me , you know , to keep any remembrances , after he was married . i knew it was—but had not resolution enough to part with them . ”
austen	emma	“ he knew nothing about it , emma . on this article i can fully acquit him . it was a private resolution of hers , not communicated to him—or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction.—till yesterday , i know he said he was in the dark as to her plans . they burst on him , i do not know how , but by some letter or message—and it was the discovery of what she was doing , of this very project of hers , which determined him to come forward at once , own it all to his uncle , throw himself on his kindness , and , in short , put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long . ”
austen	emma	if mr. elton , on his return , made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do , she could not imagine harriet ’ s persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him .
austen	emma	mrs. weston ’ s friends were all made happy by her safety ; and if the satisfaction of her well-doing could be increased to emma , it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl . she had been decided in wishing for a miss weston . she would not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match for her , hereafter , with either of isabella ’ s sons ; but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best . it would be a great comfort to mr. weston , as he grew older—and even mr. weston might be growing older ten years hence—to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense , the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home ; and mrs. weston—no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her ; and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach , should not have their powers in exercise again .
austen	emma	mrs. elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly . it was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was _not_ a fine lady ; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of it ; —and she was considering in what way she had best retract , when mr. weston went on .
austen	emma	mr. knightley , however , shewed no triumphant happiness . he could not say that he was sorry on his own account ; his very cheerful look would have contradicted him if he had ; but he said , and very steadily , that he was sorry for the disappointment of the others , and with considerable kindness added ,
austen	emma	mrs. elton turned to mrs. weston . “ i have no doubt of its being our carriage with miss bates and jane . our coachman and horses are so extremely expeditious ! —i believe we drive faster than any body.—what a pleasure it is to send one ’ s carriage for a friend ! —i understand you were so kind as to offer , but another time it will be quite unnecessary . you may be very sure i shall always take care of _them_ . ”
austen	emma	miss woodhouse made the proper acquiescence ; and finding that nothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of mrs. cole ’ s , turned to frank churchill . “ why do you smile ? ” said she .
austen	emma	“ should i send it to mrs. goddard ’ s , ma ’ am ? ” asked mrs. ford.— “ yes—no—yes , to mrs. goddard ’ s . only my pattern gown is at hartfield . no , you shall send it to hartfield , if you please . but then , mrs. goddard will want to see it.—and i could take the pattern gown home any day . but i shall want the ribbon directly—so it had better go to hartfield—at least the ribbon . you could make it into two parcels , mrs. ford , could not you ? ”
austen	emma	“ him ! —never , never . dear miss woodhouse , how could you so mistake me ? ” turning away distressed . “ harriet ! ” cried emma , after a moment ’ s pause— “ what do you mean ? —good heaven ! what do you mean ? —mistake you ! —am i to suppose then ? — ”
austen	emma	chapter iii mr. woodhouse was fond of society in his own way . he liked very much to have his friends come and see him ; and from various united causes , from his long residence at hartfield , and his good nature , from his fortune , his house , and his daughter , he could command the visits of his own little circle , in a great measure , as he liked . he had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle ; his horror of late hours , and large dinner-parties , made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms . fortunately for him , highbury , including randalls in the same parish , and donwell abbey in the parish adjoining , the seat of mr. knightley , comprehended many such . not unfrequently , through emma ’ s persuasion , he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him : but evening parties were what he preferred ; and , unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company , there was scarcely an evening in the week in which emma could not make up a card-table for him .
austen	emma	“ very true , ” said harriet . “ poor creatures ! one can think of nothing else. ” “ and really , i do not think the impression will soon be over , ” said emma , as she crossed the low hedge , and tottering footstep which ended the narrow , slippery path through the cottage garden , and brought them into the lane again . “ i do not think it will , ” stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place , and recall the still greater within .
austen	emma	it was kindly said , and very far from giving offence . a pleasant “ thank you ” seemed meant to laugh it off , but a blush , a quivering lip , a tear in the eye , shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh . her attention was now claimed by mr. woodhouse , who being , according to his custom on such occasions , making the circle of his guests , and paying his particular compliments to the ladies , was ending with her—and with all his mildest urbanity , said ,
austen	emma	“ exactly so—the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth—i have not a doubt of your success . pray , pray attempt it . as you will do it , it will indeed , to use your own words , be an exquisite possession . ”
austen	emma	“ i certainly must , ” said she . “ this sensation of listlessness , weariness , stupidity , this disinclination to sit down and employ myself , this feeling of every thing ’ s being dull and insipid about the house ! — i must be in love ; i should be the oddest creature in the world if i were not—for a few weeks at least . well ! evil to some is always good to others . i shall have many fellow-mourners for the ball , if not for frank churchill ; but mr. knightley will be happy . he may spend the evening with his dear william larkins now if he likes . ”
austen	emma	mrs. weston laughed , and said he did not know what he was talking about . used only to a large house himself , and without ever thinking how many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size , he could be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one . but emma , in her own mind , determined that he _did_ know what he was talking about , and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in life , and to marry , from worthy motives . he might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no housekeeper ’ s room , or a bad butler ’ s pantry , but no doubt he did perfectly feel that enscombe could not make him happy , and that whenever he were attached , he would willingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment .
austen	emma	she could think of nothing better : and though there was something in it which her own heart could not approve—something of ingratitude , merely glossed over—it must be done , or what would become of harriet ?
austen	emma	“ one should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school , harriet . i dare say miss nash would envy you such an opportunity as this of being married . even this conquest would appear valuable in her eyes . as to any thing superior for you , i suppose she is quite in the dark . the attentions of a certain person can hardly be among the tittle-tattle of highbury yet . hitherto i fancy you and i are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves . ”
austen	emma	“ there is one thing , emma , which a man can always do , if he chuses , and that is , his duty ; not by manoeuvring and finessing , but by vigour and resolution . it is frank churchill ’ s duty to pay this attention to his father . he knows it to be so , by his promises and messages ; but if he wished to do it , it might be done . a man who felt rightly would say at once , simply and resolutely , to mrs. churchill— ‘ every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience ; but i must go and see my father immediately . i know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion . i shall , therefore , set off to-morrow. ’ —if he would say so to her at once , in the tone of decision becoming a man , there would be no opposition made to his going . ”
austen	emma	happily , it was now time to be gone . they were off ; and emma could breathe . “ insufferable woman ! ” was her immediate exclamation . “ worse than i had supposed . absolutely insufferable ! knightley ! —i could not have believed it . knightley ! —never seen him in her life before , and call him knightley ! —and discover that he is a gentleman ! a little upstart , vulgar being , with her mr. e. , and her _caro_ _sposo_ , and her resources , and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery . actually to discover that mr. knightley is a gentleman ! i doubt whether he will return the compliment , and discover her to be a lady . i could not have believed it ! and to propose that she and i should unite to form a musical club ! one would fancy we were bosom friends ! and mrs. weston ! —astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman ! worse and worse . i never met with her equal . much beyond my hopes . harriet is disgraced by any comparison . oh ! what would frank churchill say to her , if he were here ? how angry and how diverted he would be ! ah ! there i am—thinking of him directly . always the first person to be thought of ! how i catch myself out ! frank churchill comes as regularly into my mind ! ” —
austen	emma	frank churchill caught the name . “ perry ! ” said he to emma , and trying , as he spoke , to catch miss fairfax ’ s eye . “ my friend mr. perry ! what are they saying about mr. perry ? —has he been here this morning ? —and how does he travel now ? —has he set up his carriage ? ”
austen	emma	“ my father tried it more than once , formerly ; but without receiving any benefit ; and mr. perry , whose name , i dare say , is not unknown to you , does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now . ”
austen	emma	“ oh ! dear , no , never. ” no sooner was she out of sight , than emma exclaimed , “ what an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be ! i would give any money for it . i almost long to attempt her likeness myself . you do not know it i dare say , but two or three years ago i had a great passion for taking likenesses , and attempted several of my friends , and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general . but from one cause or another , i gave it up in disgust . but really , i could almost venture , if harriet would sit to me . it would be such a delight to have her picture ! ”
austen	emma	their road to this detached cottage was down vicarage lane , a lane leading at right angles from the broad , though irregular , main street of the place ; and , as may be inferred , containing the blessed abode of mr. elton . a few inferior dwellings were first to be passed , and then , about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the vicarage , an old and not very good house , almost as close to the road as it could be . it had no advantage of situation ; but had been very much smartened up by the present proprietor ; and , such as it was , there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing eyes.—emma ’ s remark was—
austen	emma	certainly she had often , especially of late , thought his manners to herself unnecessarily gallant ; but it had passed as his way , as a mere error of judgment , of knowledge , of taste , as one proof among others that he had not always lived in the best society , that with all the gentleness of his address , true elegance was sometimes wanting ; but , till this very day , she had never , for an instant , suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect to her as harriet ’ s friend .
austen	emma	there was merit in every drawing—in the least finished , perhaps the most ; her style was spirited ; but had there been much less , or had there been ten times more , the delight and admiration of her two companions would have been the same . they were both in ecstasies . a likeness pleases every body ; and miss woodhouse ’ s performances must be capital .
austen	emma	nobody had any information to give ; and , after a few more wonderings , emma said , “ you are silent , miss fairfax—but i hope you mean to take an interest in this news . you , who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects , who must have been so deep in the business on miss campbell ’ s account—we shall not excuse your being indifferent about mr. elton and miss hawkins . ”
austen	emma	“ oh ! but those two lines are ” — — “ the best of all . granted ; —for private enjoyment ; and for private enjoyment keep them . they are not at all the less written you know , because you divide them . the couplet does not cease to be , nor does its meaning change . but take it away , and all _appropriation_ ceases , and a very pretty gallant charade remains , fit for any collection . depend upon it , he would not like to have his charade slighted , much better than his passion . a poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities , or neither . give me the book , i will write it down , and then there can be no possible reflection on you . ”
austen	emma	“ certainly , he is not like mr. knightley . he has not such a fine air and way of walking as mr. knightley . i see the difference plain enough . but mr. knightley is so very fine a man ! ”
austen	emma	he thought much of the evils of the journey for her , and not a little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way ; but his alarms were needless ; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished , and mr. and mrs. john knightley , their five children , and a competent number of nursery-maids , all reaching hartfield in safety . the bustle and joy of such an arrival , the many to be talked to , welcomed , encouraged , and variously dispersed and disposed of , produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause , nor have endured much longer even for this ; but the ways of hartfield and the feelings of her father were so respected by mrs. john knightley , that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones , and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance , all the eating and drinking , and sleeping and playing , which they could possibly wish for , without the smallest delay , the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him , either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them .
austen	emma	“ they told me—that mr. martin dined with them last saturday. ” “ oh ! ” “ he came to their father upon some business , and he asked him to stay to dinner. ” “ oh ! ” “ they talked a great deal about him , especially anne cox . i do not know what she meant , but she asked me if i thought i should go and stay there again next summer . ”
austen	emma	chapter iv a very few days had passed after this adventure , when harriet came one morning to emma with a small parcel in her hand , and after sitting down and hesitating , thus began :
austen	emma	“ i rather hope to satisfy you both , ” said emma , “ for i shall do all in my power to make them happy , which will be enough for isabella ; and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic . ”
austen	emma	“ the evil of the distance from enscombe , ” said mr. weston , “ is , that mrs. churchill , _as_ _we_ _understand_ , has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together . in frank ’ s last letter she complained , he said , of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having both his arm and his uncle ’ s ! this , you know , speaks a great degree of weakness—but now she is so impatient to be in town , that she means to sleep only two nights on the road.—so frank writes word . certainly , delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions , mrs. elton . you must grant me that . ”
austen	emma	“ you seem determined to think ill of him. ” “ me ! —not at all , ” replied mr. knightley , rather displeased ; “ i do not want to think ill of him . i should be as ready to acknowledge his merits as any other man ; but i hear of none , except what are merely personal ; that he is well-grown and good-looking , with smooth , plausible manners . ”
austen	emma	“ for when a lady ’ s in the case , “ you know all other things give place. ” now i say , my dear , in _our_ case , for _lady_ , read——mum ! a word to the wise.—i am in a fine flow of spirits , an ’ t i ? but i want to set your heart at ease as to mrs. s.—_my_ representation , you see , has quite appeased her . ”
austen	emma	they arrived.—mrs . weston was alone in the drawing-room : —but hardly had they been told of the baby , and mr. woodhouse received the thanks for coming , which he asked for , when a glimpse was caught through the blind , of two figures passing near the window .
austen	emma	“ yes , yes , pray pass _me_ , ” added her husband , with a sort of sneering consciousness ; “ _i_ have nothing to say that can entertain miss woodhouse , or any other young lady . an old married man—quite good for nothing . shall we walk , augusta ? ”
austen	emma	harriet could just answer , “ oh ! dear , yes , ” before the gentleman joined them . the wants and sufferings of the poor family , however , were the first subject on meeting . he had been going to call on them . his visit he would now defer ; but they had a very interesting parley about what could be done and should be done . mr. elton then turned back to accompany them .
austen	emma	“ i was not quite impartial in my judgment , emma : —but yet , i think—had _you_ not been in the case—i should still have distrusted him. ” when he came to miss woodhouse , he was obliged to read the whole of it aloud—all that related to her , with a smile ; a look ; a shake of the head ; a word or two of assent , or disapprobation ; or merely of love , as the subject required ; concluding , however , seriously , and , after steady reflection , thus—
austen	emma	it was felt as such things must be felt . every body had a degree of gravity and sorrow ; tenderness towards the departed , solicitude for the surviving friends ; and , in a reasonable time , curiosity to know where she would be buried . goldsmith tells us , that when lovely woman stoops to folly , she has nothing to do but to die ; and when she stoops to be disagreeable , it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill-fame . mrs. churchill , after being disliked at least twenty-five years , was now spoken of with compassionate allowances . in one point she was fully justified . she had never been admitted before to be seriously ill . the event acquitted her of all the fancifulness , and all the selfishness of imaginary complaints .
austen	emma	she was a very pretty girl , and her beauty happened to be of a sort which emma particularly admired . she was short , plump , and fair , with a fine bloom , blue eyes , light hair , regular features , and a look of great sweetness , and , before the end of the evening , emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person , and quite determined to continue the acquaintance .
austen	emma	mr. weston gave her the history of the engagements at enscombe , which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command , as well as the route and the method of his journey ; and she listened , and smiled , and congratulated .
austen	emma	“ you think i ought to refuse him then , ” said harriet , looking down . “ ought to refuse him ! my dear harriet , what do you mean ? are you in any doubt as to that ? i thought—but i beg your pardon , perhaps i have been under a mistake . i certainly have been misunderstanding you , if you feel in doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer . i had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it . ”
austen	emma	humph—harriet ’ s ready wit ! all the better . a man must be very much in love , indeed , to describe her so . ah ! mr. knightley , i wish you had the benefit of this ; i think this would convince you . for once in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken . an excellent charade indeed ! and very much to the purpose . things must come to a crisis soon now . ”
austen	emma	all this spoken extremely fast obliged miss bates to stop for breath ; and emma said something very civil about the excellence of miss fairfax ’ s handwriting . “ you are extremely kind , ” replied miss bates , highly gratified ; “ you who are such a judge , and write so beautifully yourself . i am sure there is nobody ’ s praise that could give us so much pleasure as miss woodhouse ’ s . my mother does not hear ; she is a little deaf you know . ma ’ am , ” addressing her , “ do you hear what miss woodhouse is so obliging to say about jane ’ s handwriting ? ”
austen	emma	“ so do i , ” said mrs. weston gently , “ very much. ” “ she always declares she will never marry , which , of course , means just nothing at all . but i have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she cared for . it would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love with a proper object . i should like to see emma in love , and in some doubt of a return ; it would do her good . but there is nobody hereabouts to attach her ; and she goes so seldom from home . ”
austen	emma	she soon believed herself to penetrate mrs. elton ’ s thoughts , and understand why she was , like herself , in happy spirits ; it was being in miss fairfax ’ s confidence , and fancying herself acquainted with what was still a secret to other people . emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face ; and while paying her own compliments to mrs. bates , and appearing to attend to the good old lady ’ s replies , she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to miss fairfax , and return it into the purple and gold reticule by her side , saying , with significant nods ,
austen	emma	it seemed an unnecessary caution ; jane was wanting to give her words , not to mrs. elton , but to miss woodhouse , as the latter plainly saw . the wish of distinguishing her , as far as civility permitted , was very evident , though it could not often proceed beyond a look .
austen	emma	poor old mrs. bates , civil and humble as usual , looked as if she did not quite understand what was going on . “ i am afraid jane is not very well , ” said she , “ but i do not know ; they _tell_ me she is well . i dare say my daughter will be here presently , miss woodhouse . i hope you find a chair . i wish hetty had not gone . i am very little able—have you a chair , ma ’ am ? do you sit where you like ? i am sure she will be here presently . ”
austen	emma	she played . “ what felicity it is to hear a tune again which _has_ made one happy ! —if i mistake not that was danced at weymouth. ” she looked up at him for a moment , coloured deeply , and played something else . he took some music from a chair near the pianoforte , and turning to emma , said ,
austen	emma	“ it is as long again as almost all we have had before. ” “ i do not consider its length as particularly in its favour . such things in general can not be too short . ”
austen	emma	poor man ! —it was at first a considerable shock to him , and he tried earnestly to dissuade her from it . she was reminded , more than once , of having always said she would never marry , and assured that it would be a great deal better for her to remain single ; and told of poor isabella , and poor miss taylor.—but it would not do . emma hung about him affectionately , and smiled , and said it must be so ; and that he must not class her with isabella and mrs. weston , whose marriages taking them from hartfield , had , indeed , made a melancholy change : but she was not going from hartfield ; she should be always there ; she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better ; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having mr. knightley always at hand , when he were once got used to the idea.—did he not love mr. knightley very much ? —he would not deny that he did , she was sure.—whom did he ever want to consult on business but mr. knightley ? —who was so useful to him , who so ready to write his letters , who so glad to assist him ? —who so cheerful , so attentive , so attached to him ? —would not he like to have him always on the spot ? —yes . that was all very true . mr. knightley could not be there too often ; he should be glad to see him every day ; —but they did see him every day as it was.—why could not they go on as they had done ?
austen	emma	in a few minutes the carriage returned.—somebody talked of rain.— “ i will see that there are umbrellas , sir , ” said frank to his father : “ miss bates must not be forgotten : ” and away he went . mr. weston was following ; but mrs. elton detained him , to gratify him by her opinion of his son ; and so briskly did she begin , that the young man himself , though by no means moving slowly , could hardly be out of hearing .
austen	emma	“ i assure you she did . she felt your full meaning . she has talked of it since . i wish you could have heard how she talked of it—with what candour and generosity . i wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance , in being able to pay her such attentions , as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father , when her society must be so irksome . ”
austen	emma	sixteen years had miss taylor been in mr. woodhouse ’ s family , less as a governess than a friend , very fond of both daughters , but particularly of emma . between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters . even before miss taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess , the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint ; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away , they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached , and emma doing just what she liked ; highly esteeming miss taylor ’ s judgment , but directed chiefly by her own .
austen	emma	emma heard that frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement , and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends—for the house was taken for may and june . she was told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them , almost as often as he could even wish .
austen	emma	“ it comes to the same thing . i can have no self-command without a motive . you order me , whether you speak or not . and you can be always with me . you are always with me . ”
austen	emma	“ well , mrs. weston , ” said emma triumphantly when he left them , “ what do you say now to mr. knightley ’ s marrying jane fairfax ? ” “ why , really , dear emma , i say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of _not_ being in love with her , that i should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last . do not beat me . ”
austen	emma	jane did not look round . she was not obliged to hear . mrs. weston had been speaking to her at the same moment . “ it is not fair , ” said emma , in a whisper ; “ mine was a random guess . do not distress her . ”
austen	emma	“ dear me ! but what shall you do ? how shall you employ yourself when you grow old ? ” “ if i know myself , harriet , mine is an active , busy mind , with a great many independent resources ; and i do not perceive why i should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty . woman ’ s usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now ; or with no important variation . if i draw less , i shall read more ; if i give up music , i shall take to carpet-work . and as for objects of interest , objects for the affections , which is in truth the great point of inferiority , the want of which is really the great evil to be avoided in _not_ marrying , i shall be very well off , with all the children of a sister i love so much , to care about . there will be enough of them , in all probability , to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need . there will be enough for every hope and every fear ; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent , it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder . my nephews and nieces ! —i shall often have a niece with me . ”
austen	emma	“ yes , ” replied harriet modestly , but not fearfully— “ i must say that i have. ” emma ’ s eyes were instantly withdrawn ; and she sat silently meditating , in a fixed attitude , for a few minutes . a few minutes were sufficient for making her acquainted with her own heart . a mind like hers , once opening to suspicion , made rapid progress . she touched—she admitted—she acknowledged the whole truth . why was it so much worse that harriet should be in love with mr. knightley , than with frank churchill ? why was the evil so dreadfully increased by harriet ’ s having some hope of a return ? it darted through her , with the speed of an arrow , that mr. knightley must marry no one but herself !
austen	emma	“ very true , miss woodhouse , so she will . he is the very best young man—but , my dear jane , if you remember , i told you yesterday he was precisely the height of mr. perry . miss hawkins , —i dare say , an excellent young woman . his extreme attention to my mother—wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew , that she might hear the better , for my mother is a little deaf , you know—it is not much , but she does not hear quite quick . jane says that colonel campbell is a little deaf . he fancied bathing might be good for it—the warm bath—but she says it did him no lasting benefit . colonel campbell , you know , is quite our angel . and mr. dixon seems a very charming young man , quite worthy of him . it is such a happiness when good people get together—and they always do . now , here will be mr. elton and miss hawkins ; and there are the coles , such very good people ; and the perrys—i suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than mr. and mrs. perry . i say , sir , ” turning to mr. woodhouse , “ i think there are few places with such society as highbury . i always say , we are quite blessed in our neighbours.—my dear sir , if there is one thing my mother loves better than another , it is pork—a roast loin of pork— ”
austen	emma	he made no answer ; merely looked , and bowed in submission ; and soon afterwards said , in a lively tone , “ well , i have so little confidence in my own judgment , that whenever i marry , i hope some body will chuse my wife for me . will you ? ( turning to emma . ) will you chuse a wife for me ? —i am sure i should like any body fixed on by you . you provide for the family , you know , ( with a smile at his father ) . find some body for me . i am in no hurry . adopt her , educate her . ”
austen	emma	the day came , the party were punctually assembled , and mr. john knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable . instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited for dinner , he was talking to miss fairfax . mrs. elton , as elegant as lace and pearls could make her , he looked at in silence—wanting only to observe enough for isabella ’ s information—but miss fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl , and he could talk to her . he had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a walk with his little boys , when it had been just beginning to rain . it was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject , and he said ,
austen	emma	“ it is odd though , ” observed his father , “ that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at enscombe . perry ’ s setting up his carriage ! and his wife ’ s persuading him to it , out of care for his health—just what will happen , i have no doubt , some time or other ; only a little premature . what an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream ! and at others , what a heap of absurdities it is ! well , frank , your dream certainly shews that highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent . emma , you are a great dreamer , i think ? ”
austen	emma	“ perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day , out of so few , in having your hair cut. ” “ no , ” said he , smiling , “ that is no subject of regret at all . i have no pleasure in seeing my friends , unless i can believe myself fit to be seen . ”
austen	emma	“ why , to be sure , ” said mr. woodhouse— “ yes , certainly—i can not deny that mrs. weston , poor mrs. weston , does come and see us pretty often—but then—she is always obliged to go away again . ”
austen	emma	“ it is one that i shall never change , however. ” after another short hesitation , “ i hope it does not proceed from—i hope it is not in compliment to mr. elton ? ” “ mr . elton indeed ! ” cried harriet indignantly.— “ oh ! no ” —and emma could just catch the words , “ so superior to mr. elton ! ”
austen	emma	“ i am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature , in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connexions , and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure , from living with those who have always set him the example of it . it is a great deal more natural than one could wish , that a young man , brought up by those who are proud , luxurious , and selfish , should be proud , luxurious , and selfish too . if frank churchill had wanted to see his father , he would have contrived it between september and january . a man at his age—what is he ? —three or four-and-twenty— can not be without the means of doing as much as that . it is impossible . ”
austen	emma	“ oh ! she _shall_ _not_ do such a thing again , ” eagerly rejoined mrs. elton . “ we will not allow her to do such a thing again : ” —and nodding significantly— “ there must be some arrangement made , there must indeed . i shall speak to mr. e. the man who fetches our letters every morning ( one of our men , i forget his name ) shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you . that will obviate all difficulties you know ; and from _us_ i really think , my dear jane , you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation . ”
austen	emma	while waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off , emma found time , in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her voice and her taste , to look about , and see what became of mr. knightley . this would be a trial . he was no dancer in general . if he were to be very alert in engaging jane fairfax now , it might augur something . there was no immediate appearance . no ; he was talking to mrs. cole—he was looking on unconcerned ; jane was asked by somebody else , and he was still talking to mrs. cole .
austen	emma	“ i am glad you approve of what i have done , ” said he very comfortably . “ but i thought you would . such schemes as these are nothing without numbers . one can not have too large a party . a large party secures its own amusement . and she is a good-natured woman after all . one could not leave her out . ”
austen	emma	“ not quite . my idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the dining-room . the nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies , with their servants and furniture , i think is best observed by meals within doors . when you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden , there shall be cold meat in the house . ”
austen	emma	poor mr. woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming , and so anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride.—could he have seen the heart , he would have cared very little for the lungs ; but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil , without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either , he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had received from mr. perry , and talked on with much self-contentment , totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return .
austen	emma	“ as you are going farther on business , sir , i will take the opportunity of paying a visit , which must be paid some day or other , and therefore may as well be paid now . i have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours , ( turning to emma , ) a lady residing in or near highbury ; a family of the name of fairfax . i shall have no difficulty , i suppose , in finding the house ; though fairfax , i believe , is not the proper name—i should rather say barnes , or bates . do you know any family of that name ? ”
austen	emma	“ but you should tell them of the letter , my dear , ” said her father . “ he wrote a letter to poor mrs. weston , to congratulate her , and a very proper , handsome letter it was . she shewed it to me . i thought it very well done of him indeed . whether it was his own idea you know , one can not tell . he is but young , and his uncle , perhaps— ”
austen	emma	with mixed feelings , she seated herself at a little distance from the numbers round the instrument , to listen . frank churchill sang again . they had sung together once or twice , it appeared , at weymouth . but the sight of mr. knightley among the most attentive , soon drew away half emma ’ s mind ; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of mrs. weston ’ s suspicions , to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions . her objections to mr. knightley ’ s marrying did not in the least subside . she could see nothing but evil in it . it would be a great disappointment to mr. john knightley ; consequently to isabella . a real injury to the children—a most mortifying change , and material loss to them all ; —a very great deduction from her father ’ s daily comfort—and , as to herself , she could not at all endure the idea of jane fairfax at donwell abbey . a mrs. knightley for them all to give way to ! —no—mr . knightley must never marry . little henry must remain the heir of donwell .
austen	emma	“ i met william larkins , ” continued mr. elton , “ as i got near the house , and he told me i should not find his master at home , but i did not believe him.—william seemed rather out of humour . he did not know what was come to his master lately , he said , but he could hardly ever get the speech of him . i have nothing to do with william ’ s wants , but it really is of very great importance that _i_ should see knightley to-day ; and it becomes a matter , therefore , of very serious inconvenience that i should have had this hot walk to no purpose . ”
austen	emma	“ yes , ” said jane , “ we heard his kind offers , we heard every thing. ” “ oh ! yes , my dear , i dare say you might , because you know , the door was open , and the window was open , and mr. knightley spoke loud . you must have heard every thing to be sure . ‘ can i do any thing for you at kingston ? ’ said he ; so i just mentioned .... oh ! miss woodhouse , must you be going ? —you seem but just come—so very obliging of you . ”
austen	emma	there was no time for farther remark or explanation . the dream must be borne with , and mr. knightley must take his seat with the rest round the large modern circular table which emma had introduced at hartfield , and which none but emma could have had power to place there and persuade her father to use , instead of the small-sized pembroke , on which two of his daily meals had , for forty years been crowded . tea passed pleasantly , and nobody seemed in a hurry to move .
austen	emma	by birth she belonged to highbury : and when at three years old , on losing her mother , she became the property , the charge , the consolation , the foundling of her grandmother and aunt , there had seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there ; of her being taught only what very limited means could command , and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement , to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person , good understanding , and warm-hearted , well-meaning relations .
austen	emma	“ a straightforward , open-hearted man like weston , and a rational , unaffected woman like miss taylor , may be safely left to manage their own concerns . you are more likely to have done harm to yourself , than good to them , by interference . ”
austen	emma	she exerted herself , and did try to make her comfortable , by considering all that had passed as a mere trifle , and quite unworthy of being dwelt on , “ it might be distressing , for the moment , ” said she ; “ but you seem to have behaved extremely well ; and it is over—and may never—can never , as a first meeting , occur again , and therefore you need not think about it . ”
austen	emma	“ dear me ! —it is so odd to hear a woman talk so ! ” — “ i have none of the usual inducements of women to marry . were i to fall in love , indeed , it would be a different thing ! but i never have been in love ; it is not my way , or my nature ; and i do not think i ever shall . and , without love , i am sure i should be a fool to change such a situation as mine . fortune i do not want ; employment i do not want ; consequence i do not want : i believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband ’ s house as i am of hartfield ; and never , never could i expect to be so truly beloved and important ; so always first and always right in any man ’ s eyes as i am in my father ’ s . ”
austen	emma	“ perfectly , perfectly right , my dearest harriet ; you are doing just what you ought . while you were at all in suspense i kept my feelings to myself , but now that you are so completely decided i have no hesitation in approving . dear harriet , i give myself joy of this . it would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance , which must have been the consequence of your marrying mr. martin . while you were in the smallest degree wavering , i said nothing about it , because i would not influence ; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me . i could not have visited mrs. robert martin , of abbey-mill farm . now i am secure of you for ever . ”
austen	emma	“ oh ! dear , no , ” said her companion . they walked on . the lane made a slight bend ; and when that bend was passed , mr. elton was immediately in sight ; and so near as to give emma time only to say farther ,
austen	emma	“ impropriety ! oh ! mrs. weston—it is too calm a censure . much , much beyond impropriety ! —it has sunk him , i can not say how it has sunk him in my opinion . so unlike what a man should be ! —none of that upright integrity , that strict adherence to truth and principle , that disdain of trick and littleness , which a man should display in every transaction of his life . ”
austen	emma	emma turned away her head , divided between tears and smiles . “ it is impossible that emma should not miss such a companion , ” said mr. knightley . “ we should not like her so well as we do , sir , if we could suppose it ; but she knows how much the marriage is to miss taylor ’ s advantage ; she knows how very acceptable it must be , at miss taylor ’ s time of life , to be settled in a home of her own , and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision , and therefore can not allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure . every friend of miss taylor must be glad to have her so happily married . ”
austen	emma	“ mr . elton , this is the most extraordinary conduct ! and i can account for it only in one way ; you are not yourself , or you could not speak either to me , or of harriet , in such a manner . command yourself enough to say no more , and i will endeavour to forget it . ”
austen	emma	“ i am very much astonished , mr. elton . this to _me_ ! you forget yourself—you take me for my friend—any message to miss smith i shall be happy to deliver ; but no more of this to _me_ , if you please . ”
austen	emma	mr. weston ’ s own happiness was indisputable . he was quite delighted . it was the very circumstance he could have wished for . now , it would be really having frank in their neighbourhood . what were nine miles to a young man ? —an hour ’ s ride . he would be always coming over . the difference in that respect of richmond and london was enough to make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never . sixteen miles—nay , eighteen—it must be full eighteen to manchester-street—was a serious obstacle . were he ever able to get away , the day would be spent in coming and returning . there was no comfort in having him in london ; he might as well be at enscombe ; but richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse . better than nearer !
austen	emma	“ they are to be put into mr. weston ’ s stable , papa . you know we have settled all that already . we talked it all over with mr. weston last night . and as for james , you may be very sure he will always like going to randalls , because of his daughter ’ s being housemaid there . i only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else . that was your doing , papa . you got hannah that good place . nobody thought of hannah till you mentioned her—james is so obliged to you ! ”
austen	emma	mr. knightley , who , for some reason best known to himself , had certainly taken an early dislike to frank churchill , was only growing to dislike him more . he began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of emma . that emma was his object appeared indisputable . every thing declared it ; his own attentions , his father ’ s hints , his mother-in-law ’ s guarded silence ; it was all in unison ; words , conduct , discretion , and indiscretion , told the same story . but while so many were devoting him to emma , and emma herself making him over to harriet , mr. knightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with jane fairfax . he could not understand it ; but there were symptoms of intelligence between them—he thought so at least—symptoms of admiration on his side , which , having once observed , he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning , however he might wish to escape any of emma ’ s errors of imagination . _she_ was not present when the suspicion first arose . he was dining with the randalls family , and jane , at the eltons ’ ; and he had seen a look , more than a single look , at miss fairfax , which , from the admirer of miss woodhouse , seemed somewhat out of place . when he was again in their company , he could not help remembering what he had seen ; nor could he avoid observations which , unless it were like cowper and his fire at twilight ,
austen	emma	mr. weston meanwhile , perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was exciting , happy and cheerful as usual , and with all the right of being principal talker , which a day spent anywhere from home confers , was making himself agreeable among the rest ; and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner , convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants had been forgotten , and spread abroad what public news he had heard , was proceeding to a family communication , which , though principally addressed to mrs. weston , he had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in the room . he gave her a letter , it was from frank , and to herself ; he had met with it in his way , and had taken the liberty of opening it .
austen	emma	“ i am sorry to hear you say so , sir ; but i assure you , excepting those little nervous head-aches and palpitations which i am never entirely free from anywhere , i am quite well myself ; and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed , it was only because they were a little more tired than usual , from their journey and the happiness of coming . i hope you will think better of their looks to-morrow ; for i assure you mr. wingfield told me , that he did not believe he had ever sent us off altogether , in such good case . i trust , at least , that you do not think mr. knightley looking ill , ” turning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband .
austen	emma	“ indeed , i am very sorry to be right in this instance . i would much rather have been merry than wise. ” “ if i can come again , we are still to have our ball . my father depends on it . do not forget your engagement . ”
austen	emma	“ mr . knightley and jane fairfax ! ” exclaimed emma . “ dear mrs. weston , how could you think of such a thing ? —mr . knightley ! —mr . knightley must not marry ! —you would not have little henry cut out from donwell ? —oh ! no , no , henry must have donwell . i can not at all consent to mr. knightley ’ s marrying ; and i am sure it is not at all likely . i am amazed that you should think of such a thing . ”
austen	emma	“ and how did you think miss fairfax looking ? ” “ ill , very ill—that is , if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill . but the expression is hardly admissible , mrs. weston , is it ? ladies can never look ill. and , seriously , miss fairfax is naturally so pale , as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.—a most deplorable want of complexion . ”
austen	emma	“ oh ! no—what an impudent dog i was ! —how could i dare— ” but he laughed so heartily at the recollection , that emma could not help saying , “ i do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time , you had very great amusement in tricking us all.—i am sure you had.—i am sure it was a consolation to you . ”
austen	emma	“ and i am quite serious too , i assure you , ” replied mrs. elton gaily , “ in resolving to be always on the watch , and employing my friends to watch also , that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us . ”
austen	emma	after waiting a moment , as if to be sure she intended to say no more , he replied , “ if you mean miss fairfax and frank churchill , i have heard that already . ”
austen	emma	“ upon my word , emma , to hear you abusing the reason you have , is almost enough to make me think so too . better be without sense , than misapply it as you do . ”
austen	emma	“ yes ; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction . many counties , i believe , are called the garden of england , as well as surry. ” “ no , i fancy not , ” replied mrs. elton , with a most satisfied smile . “ i never heard any county but surry called so . ”
austen	emma	understanding and gratification came together . it might be a very indifferent piece of wit , but emma found a great deal to laugh at and enjoy in it—and so did frank and harriet.—it did not seem to touch the rest of the party equally ; some looked very stupid about it , and mr. knightley gravely said ,
austen	emma	mrs. weston , with her baby on her knee , indulging in such reflections as these , was one of the happiest women in the world . if any thing could increase her delight , it was perceiving that the baby would soon have outgrown its first set of caps .
austen	emma	“ conjecture—aye , sometimes one conjectures right , and sometimes one conjectures wrong . i wish i could conjecture how soon i shall make this rivet quite firm . what nonsense one talks , miss woodhouse , when hard at work , if one talks at all ; —your real workmen , i suppose , hold their tongues ; but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word—miss fairfax said something about conjecturing . there , it is done . i have the pleasure , madam , ( to mrs. bates , ) of restoring your spectacles , healed for the present . ”
austen	emma	for some time she was amused , without thinking beyond the immediate cause ; but as she came to understand the family better , other feelings arose . she had taken up a wrong idea , fancying it was a mother and daughter , a son and son ’ s wife , who all lived together ; but when it appeared that the mr. martin , who bore a part in the narrative , and was always mentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doing something or other , was a single man ; that there was no young mrs. martin , no wife in the case ; she did suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness , and that , if she were not taken care of , she might be required to sink herself forever .
austen	emma	now , it so happened that in spite of emma ’ s resolution of never marrying , there was something in the name , in the idea of mr. frank churchill , which always interested her . she had frequently thought—especially since his father ’ s marriage with miss taylor—that if she _were_ to marry , he was the very person to suit her in age , character and condition . he seemed by this connexion between the families , quite to belong to her . she could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think of . that mr. and mrs. weston did think of it , she was very strongly persuaded ; and though not meaning to be induced by him , or by any body else , to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for , she had a great curiosity to see him , a decided intention of finding him pleasant , of being liked by him to a certain degree , and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends ’ imaginations .
austen	emma	“ i can not believe that he has not the power of coming , if he made a point of it . it is too unlikely , for me to believe it without proof. ” “ how odd you are ! what has mr. frank churchill done , to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature ? ”
austen	emma	the charming augusta hawkins , in addition to all the usual advantages of perfect beauty and merit , was in possession of an independent fortune , of so many thousands as would always be called ten ; a point of some dignity , as well as some convenience : the story told well ; he had not thrown himself away—he had gained a woman of 10,000 _l_ . or thereabouts ; and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity—the first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice ; the history which he had to give mrs. cole of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious—the steps so quick , from the accidental rencontre , to the dinner at mr. green ’ s , and the party at mrs. brown ’ s—smiles and blushes rising in importance—with consciousness and agitation richly scattered—the lady had been so easily impressed—so sweetly disposed—had in short , to use a most intelligible phrase , been so very ready to have him , that vanity and prudence were equally contented .
austen	emma	“ ah ! that ’ s a great pity ; for i assure you , miss woodhouse , where the waters do agree , it is quite wonderful the relief they give . in my bath life , i have seen such instances of it ! and it is so cheerful a place , that it could not fail of being of use to mr. woodhouse ’ s spirits , which , i understand , are sometimes much depressed . and as to its recommendations to _you_ , i fancy i need not take much pains to dwell on them . the advantages of bath to the young are pretty generally understood . it would be a charming introduction for you , who have lived so secluded a life ; and i could immediately secure you some of the best society in the place . a line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance ; and my particular friend , mrs. partridge , the lady i have always resided with when in bath , would be most happy to shew you any attentions , and would be the very person for you to go into public with . ”
austen	emma	“ i merely asked , whether you had known much of miss fairfax and her party at weymouth. ” “ and now that i understand your question , i must pronounce it to be a very unfair one . it is always the lady ’ s right to decide on the degree of acquaintance . miss fairfax must already have given her account.—i shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow . ”
austen	emma	“ i lay it down as a general rule , harriet , that if a woman _doubts_ as to whether she should accept a man or not , she certainly ought to refuse him . if she can hesitate as to ‘ yes , ’ she ought to say ‘ no ’ directly . it is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings , with half a heart . i thought it my duty as a friend , and older than yourself , to say thus much to you . but do not imagine that i want to influence you . ”
austen	emma	the wedding was very much like other weddings , where the parties have no taste for finery or parade ; and mrs. elton , from the particulars detailed by her husband , thought it all extremely shabby , and very inferior to her own.— “ very little white satin , very few lace veils ; a most pitiful business ! —selina would stare when she heard of it. ” —but , in spite of these deficiencies , the wishes , the hopes , the confidence , the predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the ceremony , were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union .
austen	emma	there was no resisting such news , no possibility of avoiding the influence of such a happy face as mr. weston ’ s , confirmed as it all was by the words and the countenance of his wife , fewer and quieter , but not less to the purpose . to know that _she_ thought his coming certain was enough to make emma consider it so , and sincerely did she rejoice in their joy . it was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits . the worn-out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming ; and in the rapidity of half a moment ’ s thought , she hoped mr. elton would now be talked of no more .
austen	emma	“ nonsense ! a man does not imagine any such thing . but what is the meaning of this ? harriet smith refuse robert martin ? madness , if it is so ; but i hope you are mistaken . ”
austen	emma	“ well done , mrs. martin ! ” thought emma . “ you know what you are about. ” “ and when she had come away , mrs. martin was so very kind as to send mrs. goddard a beautiful goose—the finest goose mrs. goddard had ever seen . mrs. goddard had dressed it on a sunday , and asked all the three teachers , miss nash , and miss prince , and miss richardson , to sup with her . ”
austen	emma	“ it is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it , ” said the young man , “ though there are not many houses that i should presume on so far ; but in coming _home_ i felt i might do any thing . ”
austen	emma	“ excuse me , ma ’ am , but this is by no means my intention ; i make no inquiry myself , and should be sorry to have any made by my friends . when i am quite determined as to the time , i am not at all afraid of being long unemployed . there are places in town , offices , where inquiry would soon produce something—offices for the sale—not quite of human flesh—but of human intellect . ”
austen	emma	“ ah ! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort . nobody can be more devoted to home than i am . i was quite a proverb for it at maple grove . many a time has selina said , when she has been going to bristol , ‘ i really can not get this girl to move from the house . i absolutely must go in by myself , though i hate being stuck up in the barouche-landau without a companion ; but augusta , i believe , with her own good-will , would never stir beyond the park paling. ’ many a time has she said so ; and yet i am no advocate for entire seclusion . i think , on the contrary , when people shut themselves up entirely from society , it is a very bad thing ; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree , without living in it either too much or too little . i perfectly understand your situation , however , miss woodhouse— ( looking towards mr. woodhouse ) , your father ’ s state of health must be a great drawback . why does not he try bath ? —indeed he should . let me recommend bath to you . i assure you i have no doubt of its doing mr. woodhouse good . ”
austen	emma	but the idea of any thing to be done in a _moment_ , was increasing , not lessening , mr. woodhouse ’ s agitation . the ladies knew better how to allay it . mr. weston must be quiet , and every thing deliberately arranged .
austen	emma	this was the amount of the whole story , —of his communication and of harriet ’ s as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech.—he dared not stay longer than to see her well ; these several delays left him not another minute to lose ; and emma engaging to give assurance of her safety to mrs. goddard , and notice of there being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to mr. knightley , he set off , with all the grateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself .
austen	emma	the brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits , but principally of those of the elder , whose temper was by much the most communicative , and who was always the greater talker . as a magistrate , he had generally some point of law to consult john about , or , at least , some curious anecdote to give ; and as a farmer , as keeping in hand the home-farm at donwell , he had to tell what every field was to bear next year , and to give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life , and whose attachments were strong . the plan of a drain , the change of a fence , the felling of a tree , and the destination of every acre for wheat , turnips , or spring corn , was entered into with as much equality of interest by john , as his cooler manners rendered possible ; and if his willing brother ever left him any thing to inquire about , his inquiries even approached a tone of eagerness .
austen	emma	mr. woodhouse could not be soon reconciled ; but the worst was overcome , the idea was given ; time and continual repetition must do the rest.—to emma ’ s entreaties and assurances succeeded mr. knightley ’ s , whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome ; and he was soon used to be talked to by each , on every fair occasion.—they had all the assistance which isabella could give , by letters of the strongest approbation ; and mrs. weston was ready , on the first meeting , to consider the subject in the most serviceable light—first , as a settled , and , secondly , as a good one—well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to mr. woodhouse ’ s mind.—it was agreed upon , as what was to be ; and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness ; and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it , he began to think that some time or other—in another year or two , perhaps—it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place .
austen	emma	mr. knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick leather gaiters , and either the exertion of getting them together , or some other cause , brought the colour into his face , as he answered ,
austen	emma	“ yes , ” said his brother hesitatingly , “ there is a likeness . i know what you mean—but emma ’ s hand is the strongest. ” “ isabella and emma both write beautifully , ” said mr. woodhouse ; “ and always did . and so does poor mrs. weston ” —with half a sigh and half a smile at her .
austen	emma	it was rather too late in the day to set about being simple-minded and ignorant ; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet , and repressing imagination all the rest of her life . her second duty now , inferior only to her father ’ s claims , was to promote harriet ’ s comfort , and endeavour to prove her own affection in some better method than by match-making . she got her to hartfield , and shewed her the most unvarying kindness , striving to occupy and amuse her , and by books and conversation , to drive mr. elton from her thoughts .
austen	emma	“ mr . martin , i suppose , is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business ? he does not read ? ” “ oh yes ! —that is , no—i do not know—but i believe he has read a good deal—but not what you would think any thing of . he reads the agricultural reports , and some other books that lay in one of the window seats—but he reads all _them_ to himself . but sometimes of an evening , before we went to cards , he would read something aloud out of the elegant extracts , very entertaining . and i know he has read the vicar of wakefield . he never read the romance of the forest , nor the children of the abbey . he had never heard of such books before i mentioned them , but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can . ”
austen	emma	“ yes , ” said mr. john knightley presently , with some slyness , “ he seems to have a great deal of good-will towards you. ” “ me ! ” she replied with a smile of astonishment , “ are you imagining me to be mr. elton ’ s object ? ”
austen	emma	“ if he would be so good as to read to them , it would be a kindness indeed ! it would amuse away the difficulties of her part , and lessen the irksomeness of miss smith ’ s . ”
austen	emma	emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which mr. weston depended , and felt , that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes , was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity . she liked his open manners , but a little less of open-heartedness would have made him a higher character.—general benevolence , but not general friendship , made a man what he ought to be.—she could fancy such a man . the whole party walked about , and looked , and praised again ; and then , having nothing else to do , formed a sort of half-circle round the fire , to observe in their various modes , till other subjects were started , that , though _may_ , a fire in the evening was still very pleasant .
austen	emma	“ aye , very true.—i wish i could recollect more of it . kitty , a fair but frozen maid . the name makes me think of poor isabella ; for she was very near being christened catherine after her grandmama . i hope we shall have her here next week . have you thought , my dear , where you shall put her—and what room there will be for the children ? ”
austen	emma	the wedding was no distant event , as the parties had only themselves to please , and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for ; and when he set out for bath again , there was a general expectation , which a certain glance of mrs. cole ’ s did not seem to contradict , that when he next entered highbury he would bring his bride .
austen	emma	“ you will not find either , between donwell and highbury . donwell lane is never dusty , and now it is perfectly dry . come on a donkey , however , if you prefer it . you can borrow mrs. cole ’ s . i would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible . ”
austen	emma	“ you do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as i am ; but still you must , at least i hope you must , think the better of him for it . i hope it does him some service with you . ”
austen	emma	there was a little blush , and then this answer , “ i must not hope to be ever situated as you are , in the midst of every dearest connexion , and therefore i can not expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters . ”

austen	emma	“ mrs . churchill is not much in my good graces , as you may suspect—but this is quite between ourselves . she is very fond of frank , and therefore i would not speak ill of her . besides , she is out of health now ; but _that_ indeed , by her own account , she has always been . i would not say so to every body , mrs. elton , but i have not much faith in mrs. churchill ’ s illness . ”
austen	emma	“ what is to be done , my dear emma ? —what is to be done ? ” was mr. woodhouse ’ s first exclamation , and all that he could say for some time . to her he looked for comfort ; and her assurances of safety , her representation of the excellence of the horses , and of james , and of their having so many friends about them , revived him a little .
austen	emma	“ very true , very true , indeed . the very thing that we have always been rather afraid of ; for we should not have liked to have her at such a distance from us , for months together—not able to come if any thing was to happen . but you see , every thing turns out for the best . they want her ( mr. and mrs. dixon ) excessively to come over with colonel and mrs. campbell ; quite depend upon it ; nothing can be more kind or pressing than their _joint_ invitation , jane says , as you will hear presently ; mr. dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention . he is a most charming young man . ever since the service he rendered jane at weymouth , when they were out in that party on the water , and she , by the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails , would have been dashed into the sea at once , and actually was all but gone , if he had not , with the greatest presence of mind , caught hold of her habit— ( i can never think of it without trembling ! ) —but ever since we had the history of that day , i have been so fond of mr. dixon ! ”
austen	emma	“ ah ! i do not know . i can not recollect.—it is very odd , but i can not recollect.—mr . elton was sitting here , i remember , much about where i am now. ” — “ well , go on . ”
austen	emma	“ who is that gentleman on horseback ? ” said she , as they proceeded—speaking more to assist mr. weston in keeping his secret , than with any other view . “ i do not know.—one of the otways.—not frank ; —it is not frank , i assure you . you will not see him . he is half way to windsor by this time . ”
austen	emma	when emma afterwards heard that jane fairfax had been seen wandering about the meadows , at some distance from highbury , on the afternoon of the very day on which she had , under the plea of being unequal to any exercise , so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage , she could have no doubt—putting every thing together—that jane was resolved to receive no kindness from _her_ . she was sorry , very sorry . her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits , inconsistency of action , and inequality of powers ; and it mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling , or esteemed so little worthy as a friend : but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good , and of being able to say to herself , that could mr. knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting jane fairfax , could he even have seen into her heart , he would not , on this occasion , have found any thing to reprove .
austen	emma	she restrained herself , however , from any of the reproofs she could have given , and only thanked mrs. elton coolly ; “ but their going to bath was quite out of the question ; and she was not perfectly convinced that the place might suit her better than her father. ” and then , to prevent farther outrage and indignation , changed the subject directly .
austen	emma	“ well , i can not understand it. ” “ that is the case with us all , papa . one half of the world can not understand the pleasures of the other. ” later in the morning , and just as the girls were going to separate in preparation for the regular four o ’ clock dinner , the hero of this inimitable charade walked in again . harriet turned away ; but emma could receive him with the usual smile , and her quick eye soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push—of having thrown a die ; and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up . his ostensible reason , however , was to ask whether mr. woodhouse ’ s party could be made up in the evening without him , or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at hartfield . if he were , every thing else must give way ; but otherwise his friend cole had been saying so much about his dining with him—had made such a point of it , that he had promised him conditionally to come .
austen	emma	“ we want only two more to be just the right number . i should like to see two more here , —your pretty little friend , miss smith , and my son—and then i should say we were quite complete . i believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing-room that we are expecting frank . i had a letter from him this morning , and he will be with us within a fortnight . ”
austen	emma	she meant to be very happy , in spite of the scene being laid at mr. cole ’ s ; and without being able to forget that among the failings of mr. elton , even in the days of his favour , none had disturbed her more than his propensity to dine with mr. cole .
austen	emma	he had , in fact , been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence . he had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it . he had come , in his anxiety to see how she bore frank churchill ’ s engagement , with no selfish view , no view at all , but of endeavouring , if she allowed him an opening , to soothe or to counsel her.—the rest had been the work of the moment , the immediate effect of what he heard , on his feelings . the delightful assurance of her total indifference towards frank churchill , of her having a heart completely disengaged from him , had given birth to the hope , that , in time , he might gain her affection himself ; —but it had been no present hope—he had only , in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment , aspired to be told that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her.—the superior hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting.—the affection , which he had been asking to be allowed to create , if he could , was already his ! —within half an hour , he had passed from a thoroughly distressed state of mind , to something so like perfect happiness , that it could bear no other name .
austen	emma	“ there appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all— ” he began rather quickly , but checking himself , added , “ however , it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were—how it might all be behind the scenes . i can only say that there was smoothness outwardly . but you , who have known miss fairfax from a child , must be a better judge of her character , and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations , than i can be . ”
austen	emma	mr. knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade . he wished to persuade mr. woodhouse , as well as emma , to join the party ; and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat would inevitably make him ill. mr. woodhouse must not , under the specious pretence of a morning drive , and an hour or two spent at donwell , be tempted away to his misery .
austen	emma	“ miss woodhouse , ” said frank churchill , after examining a table behind him , which he could reach as he sat , “ have your nephews taken away their alphabets—their box of letters ? it used to stand here . where is it ? this is a sort of dull-looking evening , that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer . we had great amusement with those letters one morning . i want to puzzle you again . ”
austen	emma	emma had not another word to oppose . she saw it all ; and entering into her feelings , promoted her quitting the house immediately , and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend . her parting look was grateful—and her parting words , “ oh ! miss woodhouse , the comfort of being sometimes alone ! ” —seemed to burst from an overcharged heart , and to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her , even towards some of those who loved her best .
austen	emma	such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could , with thorough self-approbation , recommend ; though he might constrain himself , while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things , to say :
austen	emma	she hoped they might now become friends again . she thought it was time to make up . making-up indeed would not do . _she_ certainly had not been in the wrong , and _he_ would never own that he had . concession must be out of the question ; but it was time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled ; and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of friendship , that when he came into the room she had one of the children with her—the youngest , a nice little girl about eight months old , who was now making her first visit to hartfield , and very happy to be danced about in her aunt ’ s arms . it did assist ; for though he began with grave looks and short questions , he was soon led on to talk of them all in the usual way , and to take the child out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity . emma felt they were friends again ; and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction , and then a little sauciness , she could not help saying , as he was admiring the baby ,
austen	emma	he shook his head with a smile , and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy . soon afterwards he began again , “ how much your friends in ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this occasion , miss fairfax . i dare say they often think of you , and wonder which will be the day , the precise day of the instrument ’ s coming to hand . do you imagine colonel campbell knows the business to be going forward just at this time ? —do you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him , or that he may have sent only a general direction , an order indefinite as to time , to depend upon contingencies and conveniences ? ”
austen	emma	jane had come to highbury professedly for three months ; the campbells were gone to ireland for three months ; but now the campbells had promised their daughter to stay at least till midsummer , and fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there . according to miss bates—it all came from her—mrs . dixon had written most pressingly . would jane but go , means were to be found , servants sent , friends contrived—no travelling difficulty allowed to exist ; but still she had declined it !
austen	emma	“ i am glad you think i have been useful to her ; but harriet only wanted drawing out , and receiving a few , very few hints . she had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself . i have done very little . ”
austen	emma	“ i have often thought them the worst of the two , ” replied he coolly . “ business , you know , may bring money , but friendship hardly ever does. ” “ ah ! you are not serious now . i know mr. john knightley too well—i am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body . i can easily believe that letters are very little to you , much less than to me , but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference , it is not age , but situation . you have every body dearest to you always at hand , i , probably , never shall again ; and therefore till i have outlived all my affections , a post-office , i think , must always have power to draw me out , in worse weather than to-day . ”
austen	emma	“ not a walk in the rain , i should imagine. ” “ no , but it did not absolutely rain when i set out. ” mr. john knightley smiled , and replied , “ that is to say , you chose to have your walk , for you were not six yards from your own door when i had the pleasure of meeting you ; and henry and john had seen more drops than they could count long before . the post-office has a great charm at one period of our lives . when you have lived to my age , you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for . ”
austen	emma	“ as to who , or what miss hawkins is , or how long he has been acquainted with her , ” said emma , “ nothing i suppose can be known . one feels that it can not be a very long acquaintance . he has been gone only four weeks . ”
austen	emma	it was a dislike so little just—every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy , that she never saw jane fairfax the first time after any considerable absence , without feeling that she had injured her ; and now , when the due visit was paid , on her arrival , after a two years ’ interval , she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners , which for those two whole years she had been depreciating . jane fairfax was very elegant , remarkably elegant ; and she had herself the highest value for elegance . her height was pretty , just such as almost every body would think tall , and nobody could think very tall ; her figure particularly graceful ; her size a most becoming medium , between fat and thin , though a slight appearance of ill-health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two . emma could not but feel all this ; and then , her face—her features—there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered ; it was not regular , but it was very pleasing beauty . her eyes , a deep grey , with dark eye-lashes and eyebrows , had never been denied their praise ; but the skin , which she had been used to cavil at , as wanting colour , had a clearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom . it was a style of beauty , of which elegance was the reigning character , and as such , she must , in honour , by all her principles , admire it : —elegance , which , whether of person or of mind , she saw so little in highbury . there , not to be vulgar , was distinction , and merit .
austen	emma	he proceeded a little farther , reading to himself ; and then , with a smile , observed , “ humph ! a fine complimentary opening : but it is his way . one man ’ s style must not be the rule of another ’ s . we will not be severe . ”
austen	emma	“ aye , very true . mr. perry did say so . i shall never forget it . poor little emma ! you were very bad with the measles ; that is , you would have been very bad , but for perry ’ s great attention . he came four times a day for a week . he said , from the first , it was a very good sort—which was our great comfort ; but the measles are a dreadful complaint . i hope whenever poor isabella ’ s little ones have the measles , she will send for perry . ”
austen	emma	“ i told you yesterday , ” cried mr. weston with exultation , “ i told you all that he would be here before the time named . i remembered what i used to do myself . one can not creep upon a journey ; one can not help getting on faster than one has planned ; and the pleasure of coming in upon one ’ s friends before the look-out begins , is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs . ”
austen	emma	“ yes—a good deal _nearer_. ” “ but still , not near enough to give me a chance of being right , if we think differently. ” “ i have still the advantage of you by sixteen years ’ experience , and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child . come , my dear emma , let us be friends , and say no more about it . tell your aunt , little emma , that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances , and that if she were not wrong before , she is now . ”
austen	emma	emma was delighted , and only wanted him to go on in the same style ; but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own jane , and his next words were ,
austen	emma	“ i do not understand what you mean by ‘ success , ’ ” said mr. knightley . “ success supposes endeavour . your time has been properly and delicately spent , if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage . a worthy employment for a young lady ’ s mind ! but if , which i rather imagine , your making the match , as you call it , means only your planning it , your saying to yourself one idle day , ‘ i think it would be a very good thing for miss taylor if mr. weston were to marry her , ’ and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards , why do you talk of success ? where is your merit ? what are you proud of ? you made a lucky guess ; and _that_ is all that can be said . ”
austen	emma	“ mr . knightley was there too , was he ? ” “ no , not mr. knightley ; he declined it from the first ; and though i thought he would come , because mrs. elton declared she would not let him off , he did not ; —but my mother , and jane , and i , were all there , and a very agreeable evening we had . such kind friends , you know , miss woodhouse , one must always find agreeable , though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning ’ s party . even pleasure , you know , is fatiguing—and i can not say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it . however , _i_ shall always think it a very pleasant party , and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it . ”
austen	emma	“ but have you really heard of nothing ? ” “ i have not even made any inquiry ; i do not wish to make any yet. ” “ oh ! my dear , we can not begin too early ; you are not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing . ”
austen	emma	“ she has had the advantage , you know , of practising on me , ” she continued— “ like la baronne d ’ almane on la comtesse d ’ ostalis , in madame de genlis ’ adelaide and theodore , and we shall now see her own little adelaide educated on a more perfect plan . ”
austen	emma	“ yes , certainly it does . he has had great faults , faults of inconsideration and thoughtlessness ; and i am very much of his opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves : but still as he is , beyond a doubt , really attached to miss fairfax , and will soon , it may be hoped , have the advantage of being constantly with her , i am very ready to believe his character will improve , and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants . and now , let me talk to you of something else . i have another person ’ s interest at present so much at heart , that i can not think any longer about frank churchill . ever since i left you this morning , emma , my mind has been hard at work on one subject . ”
austen	emma	emma would be “ very happy to wait on mrs. bates , & c. , ” and they did at last move out of the shop , with no farther delay from miss bates than , “ how do you do , mrs. ford ? i beg your pardon . i did not see you before . i hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town . jane came back delighted yesterday . thank ye , the gloves do very well—only a little too large about the wrist ; but jane is taking them in . ”
austen	emma	“ you are going in , i suppose ? ” said he . “ no , ” —replied emma—quite confirmed by the depressed manner in which he still spoke— “ i should like to take another turn . mr. perry is not gone. ” and , after proceeding a few steps , she added— “ i stopped you ungraciously , just now , mr. knightley , and , i am afraid , gave you pain.—but if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend , or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation—as a friend , indeed , you may command me.—i will hear whatever you like . i will tell you exactly what i think . ”
austen	emma	the frank churchill so long talked of , so high in interest , was actually before her—he was presented to her , and she did not think too much had been said in his praise ; he was a _very_ good looking young man ; height , air , address , all were unexceptionable , and his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his father ’ s ; he looked quick and sensible . she felt immediately that she should like him ; and there was a well-bred ease of manner , and a readiness to talk , which convinced her that he came intending to be acquainted with her , and that acquainted they soon must be .
austen	emma	“ my first enjoyment , ” replied john knightley , as they passed through the sweep-gate , “ will be to find myself safe at hartfield again. ” chapter xiv some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into mrs. weston ’ s drawing-room ; —mr . elton must compose his joyous looks , and mr. john knightley disperse his ill-humour . mr. elton must smile less , and mr. john knightley more , to fit them for the place.—emma only might be as nature prompted , and shew herself just as happy as she was . to her it was real enjoyment to be with the westons . mr. weston was a great favourite , and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve , as to his wife ; not any one , to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and understood , of being always interesting and always intelligible , the little affairs , arrangements , perplexities , and pleasures of her father and herself . she could tell nothing of hartfield , in which mrs. weston had not a lively concern ; and half an hour ’ s uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends , was one of the first gratifications of each .
austen	emma	“ jane , jane , my dear jane , where are you ? —here is your tippet . mrs. weston begs you to put on your tippet . she says she is afraid there will be draughts in the passage , though every thing has been done—one door nailed up—quantities of matting—my dear jane , indeed you must . mr. churchill , oh ! you are too obliging ! how well you put it on ! —so gratified ! excellent dancing indeed ! —yes , my dear , i ran home , as i said i should , to help grandmama to bed , and got back again , and nobody missed me.—i set off without saying a word , just as i told you . grandmama was quite well , had a charming evening with mr. woodhouse , a vast deal of chat , and backgammon.—tea was made downstairs , biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away : amazing luck in some of her throws : and she inquired a great deal about you , how you were amused , and who were your partners . ‘ oh ! ’ said i , ‘ i shall not forestall jane ; i left her dancing with mr. george otway ; she will love to tell you all about it herself to-morrow : her first partner was mr. elton , i do not know who will ask her next , perhaps mr. william cox. ’ my dear sir , you are too obliging.—is there nobody you would not rather ? —i am not helpless . sir , you are most kind . upon my word , jane on one arm , and me on the other ! —stop , stop , let us stand a little back , mrs. elton is going ; dear mrs. elton , how elegant she looks ! —beautiful lace ! —now we all follow in her train . quite the queen of the evening ! —well , here we are at the passage . two steps , jane , take care of the two steps . oh ! no , there is but one . well , i was persuaded there were two . how very odd ! i was convinced there were two , and there is but one . i never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style—candles everywhere.—i was telling you of your grandmama , jane , —there was a little disappointment.—the baked apples and biscuits , excellent in their way , you know ; but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first , and good mr. woodhouse , not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough , sent it all out again . now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus—so she was rather disappointed , but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body , for fear of its getting round to dear miss woodhouse , who would be so very much concerned ! —well , this is brilliant ! i am all amazement ! could not have supposed any thing ! —such elegance and profusion ! —i have seen nothing like it since—well , where shall we sit ? where shall we sit ? anywhere , so that jane is not in a draught . where _i_ sit is of no consequence . oh ! do you recommend this side ? —well , i am sure , mr. churchill—only it seems too good—but just as you please . what you direct in this house can not be wrong . dear jane , how shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama ? soup too ! bless me ! i should not be helped so soon , but it smells most excellent , and i can not help beginning . ”
austen	emma	the plan was that she should be brought up for educating others ; the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making independence impossible . to provide for her otherwise was out of colonel campbell ’ s power ; for though his income , by pay and appointments , was handsome , his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughter ’ s ; but , by giving her an education , he hoped to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter .
austen	emma	“ when i talked of your being altered by time , by the progress of years , ” said john knightley , “ i meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings . i consider one as including the other . time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle—but that is not the change i had in view for you . as an old friend , you will allow me to hope , miss fairfax , that ten years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as i have . ”
austen	emma	“ i can never think of it , ” she cried , “ without extreme shame. ” “ the shame , ” he answered , “ is all mine , or ought to be . but is it possible that you had no suspicion ? —i mean of late . early , i know , you had none . ”
austen	emma	mrs. goddard was the mistress of a school—not of a seminary , or an establishment , or any thing which professed , in long sentences of refined nonsense , to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality , upon new principles and new systems—and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity—but a real , honest , old-fashioned boarding-school , where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price , and where girls might be sent to be out of the way , and scramble themselves into a little education , without any danger of coming back prodigies . mrs. goddard ’ s school was in high repute—and very deservedly ; for highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot : she had an ample house and garden , gave the children plenty of wholesome food , let them run about a great deal in the summer , and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands . it was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked after her to church . she was a plain , motherly kind of woman , who had worked hard in her youth , and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea-visit ; and having formerly owed much to mr. woodhouse ’ s kindness , felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour , hung round with fancy-work , whenever she could , and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside .
austen	emma	this point was just arranged , when a visitor arrived to tear emma ’ s thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them , sleeping or waking , the last twenty-four hours—mrs . weston , who had been calling on her daughter-in-law elect , and took hartfield in her way home , almost as much in duty to emma as in pleasure to herself , to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview .
austen	emma	“ you will excuse my being so much over-powered . if i find him conversable , i shall be glad of his acquaintance ; but if he is only a chattering coxcomb , he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts . ”
austen	emma	“ no , ” said mr. knightley , nearly at the same time ; “ you are not often deficient ; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension . i think you understand me , therefore. ” an arch look expressed— “ i understand you well enough ; ” but she said only , “ miss fairfax is reserved . ”
austen	emma	“ harriet , i will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning . your resolution , or rather your expectation of never marrying , results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer , would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you . is not it so ? ”
austen	emma	chapter v small heart had harriet for visiting . only half an hour before her friend called for her at mrs. goddard ’ s , her evil stars had led her to the very spot where , at that moment , a trunk , directed to _the rev . philip elton , white-hart , bath_ , was to be seen under the operation of being lifted into the butcher ’ s cart , which was to convey it to where the coaches past ; and every thing in this world , excepting that trunk and the direction , was consequently a blank .
austen	emma	“ oh ! my dear ; but so much as patty has to do ! —and it is a kindness to employ our men. ” jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered ; but instead of answering , she began speaking again to mr. john knightley .
austen	emma	“ pretty well , my dear—i hope—pretty well.—i do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably. ” mr. john knightley here asked emma quietly whether there were any doubts of the air of randalls .
austen	emma	harriet blushed and smiled , and said something about wondering that people should like her so much . the idea of mr. elton was certainly cheering ; but still , after a time , she was tender-hearted again towards the rejected mr. martin .
austen	emma	emma ’ s project of forgetting mr. elton for a while made her rather sorry to find , when they had all taken their places , that he was close to her . the difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards harriet , from her mind , while he not only sat at her elbow , but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice , and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion . instead of forgetting him , his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of “ can it really be as my brother imagined ? can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from harriet to me ? —absurd and insufferable ! ” —yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm , would be so interested about her father , and so delighted with mrs. weston ; and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would-be lover , and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners . for her own sake she could not be rude ; and for harriet ’ s , in the hope that all would yet turn out right , she was even positively civil ; but it was an effort ; especially as something was going on amongst the others , in the most overpowering period of mr. elton ’ s nonsense , which she particularly wished to listen to . she heard enough to know that mr. weston was giving some information about his son ; she heard the words “ my son , ” and “ frank , ” and “ my son , ” repeated several times over ; and , from a few other half-syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son ; but before she could quiet mr. elton , the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward .
austen	emma	these feelings rapidly restored his comfort , while mrs. weston , of a more apprehensive disposition , foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays ; and after all her concern for what her husband was to suffer , suffered a great deal more herself .
austen	emma	emma liked the subject so well , that she began upon it , to mrs. weston , very soon after their moving into the drawing-room : wishing her joy—yet observing , that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.— mrs. weston agreed to it ; but added , that she should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of : “ for i can not depend upon his coming . i can not be so sanguine as mr. weston . i am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing . mr. weston , i dare say , has been telling you exactly how the matter stands ? ”
austen	emma	“ that will never be , however , i can assure you . miss fairfax , i dare say , would not have me if i were to ask her—and i am very sure i shall never ask her . ”
austen	emma	the picture , elegantly framed , came safely to hand soon after mr. elton ’ s return , and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common sitting-room , he got up to look at it , and sighed out his half sentences of admiration just as he ought ; and as for harriet ’ s feelings , they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted . emma was soon perfectly satisfied of mr. martin ’ s being no otherwise remembered , than as he furnished a contrast with mr. elton , of the utmost advantage to the latter .
austen	emma	“ you know miss fairfax ’ s situation in life , i conclude ; what she is destined to be ? ” “ yes— ( rather hesitatingly ) —i believe i do. ” “ you get upon delicate subjects , emma , ” said mrs. weston smiling ; “ remember that i am here.—mr . frank churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of miss fairfax ’ s situation in life . i will move a little farther off . ”
austen	emma	“ the carriage ! but james will not like to put the horses to for such a little way ; —and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit ? ”
austen	emma	“ it was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to hartfield . my regard for hartfield is most warm ” — he stopt again , rose again , and seemed quite embarrassed.—he was more in love with her than emma had supposed ; and who can say how it might have ended , if his father had not made his appearance ? mr. woodhouse soon followed ; and the necessity of exertion made him composed .
austen	emma	“ a man , ” said he , “ must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside , and encounter such a day as this , for the sake of coming to see him . he must think himself a most agreeable fellow ; i could not do such a thing . it is the greatest absurdity—actually snowing at this moment ! —the folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home—and the folly of people ’ s not staying comfortably at home when they can ! if we were obliged to go out such an evening as this , by any call of duty or business , what a hardship we should deem it ; —and here are we , probably with rather thinner clothing than usual , setting forward voluntarily , without excuse , in defiance of the voice of nature , which tells man , in every thing given to his view or his feelings , to stay at home himself , and keep all under shelter that he can ; —here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another man ’ s house , with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday , and may not be said and heard again to-morrow . going in dismal weather , to return probably in worse ; —four horses and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle , shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had at home . ”
austen	emma	“ oh ! no—none in the least . i never saw mrs. weston better in my life—never looking so well . papa is only speaking his own regret. ” “ very much to the honour of both , ” was the handsome reply .
austen	emma	“ i like your plan , ” cried mr. weston . “ agreed , agreed . i will do my best . i am making a conundrum . how will a conundrum reckon ? ” “ low , i am afraid , sir , very low , ” answered his son ; — “ but we shall be indulgent—especially to any one who leads the way . ”
austen	emma	the weather was most favourable for her ; though christmas day , she could not go to church . mr. woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it , and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas . the ground covered with snow , and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw , which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise , every morning beginning in rain or snow , and every evening setting in to freeze , she was for many days a most honourable prisoner . no intercourse with harriet possible but by note ; no church for her on sunday any more than on christmas day ; and no need to find excuses for mr. elton ’ s absenting himself .
austen	emma	“ my dear sir , do not make a stranger of me. ” “ i leave an excellent substitute in my daughter . emma will be happy to entertain you . and therefore i think i will beg your excuse and take my three turns—my winter walk . ”
austen	emma	“ indifferent ! oh ! no—i never conceived you could become indifferent . letters are no matter of indifference ; they are generally a very positive curse. ” “ you are speaking of letters of business ; mine are letters of friendship . ”
austen	emma	“ increase ! ” “ certainly ; you must be sensible that the last half-year has made a great difference in your way of life. ” “ difference ! no indeed i am not. ” “ there can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than you used to be . witness this very time . here am i come down for only one day , and you are engaged with a dinner-party ! —when did it happen before , or any thing like it ? your neighbourhood is increasing , and you mix more with it . a little while ago , every letter to isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties ; dinners at mr. cole ’ s , or balls at the crown . the difference which randalls , randalls alone makes in your goings-on , is very great . ”
austen	emma	“ a new neighbour for us all , miss woodhouse ! ” said miss bates , joyfully ; “ my mother is so pleased ! —she says she can not bear to have the poor old vicarage without a mistress . this is great news , indeed . jane , you have never seen mr. elton ! —no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him . ”
austen	emma	“ i wish we could contrive it , ” said she ; “ but i can not think of any tolerable pretence for going in ; —no servant that i want to inquire about of his housekeeper—no message from my father . ”
austen	emma	miss fairfax , who had seldom spoken before , except among her own confederates , spoke now . “ such things do occur , undoubtedly. ” —she was stopped by a cough . frank churchill turned towards her to listen .
austen	emma	“ i am , ” —she answered— “ i am fatigued ; but it is not the sort of fatigue—quick walking will refresh me.—miss woodhouse , we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits . mine , i confess , are exhausted . the greatest kindness you can shew me , will be to let me have my own way , and only say that i am gone when it is necessary . ”
austen	emma	there was no recovering miss taylor—nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her ; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to mr. woodhouse . the compliments of his neighbours were over ; he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event ; and the wedding-cake , which had been a great distress to him , was all eat up . his own stomach could bear nothing rich , and he could never believe other people to be different from himself . what was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body ; and he had , therefore , earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding-cake at all , and when that proved vain , as earnestly tried to prevent any body ’ s eating it . he had been at the pains of consulting mr. perry , the apothecary , on the subject . mr. perry was an intelligent , gentlemanlike man , whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of mr. woodhouse ’ s life ; and upon being applied to , he could not but acknowledge ( though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination ) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree with many—perhaps with most people , unless taken moderately . with such an opinion , in confirmation of his own , mr. woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the newly married pair ; but still the cake was eaten ; and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone .
austen	emma	“ i hope he will be here to-morrow , for i have a question or two to ask him about myself of some consequence . and , my dear , whenever he comes , you had better let him look at little bella ’ s throat . ”
austen	emma	emma smiled and answered— “ my visit was of use to the nervous part of her complaint , i hope ; but not even i can charm away a sore throat ; it is a most severe cold indeed . mr. perry has been with her , as you probably heard . ”
austen	emma	“ well , if he have nothing else to recommend him , he will be a treasure at highbury . we do not often look upon fine young men , well-bred and agreeable . we must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the bargain . can not you imagine , mr. knightley , what a _sensation_ his coming will produce ? there will be but one subject throughout the parishes of donwell and highbury ; but one interest—one object of curiosity ; it will be all mr. frank churchill ; we shall think and speak of nobody else . ”
austen	emma	emma allowed her father to talk—but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style , and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy . the happiness of miss smith was quite equal to her intentions . miss woodhouse was so great a personage in highbury , that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure ; but the humble , grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings , delighted with the affability with which miss woodhouse had treated her all the evening , and actually shaken hands with her at last !
austen	emma	he got as near as he could to thanking her for miss taylor ’ s merits , without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that miss taylor had formed miss woodhouse ’ s character , than miss woodhouse miss taylor ’ s . and at last , as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object , he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person .
austen	emma	“ mrs . gilbert does not mean to dance , but there is a young lady disengaged whom i should be very glad to see dancing—miss smith. ” “ miss smith ! —oh ! —i had not observed.—you are extremely obliging—and if i were not an old married man.—but my dancing days are over , mrs. weston . you will excuse me . any thing else i should be most happy to do , at your command—but my dancing days are over . ”
austen	emma	“ yes , and what you told me on that head , confirmed an idea which i had entertained before.—i do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either mr. dixon or miss fairfax , but i can not help suspecting either that , after making his proposals to her friend , he had the misfortune to fall in love with _her_ , or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side . one might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right ; but i am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to highbury instead of going with the campbells to ireland . here , she must be leading a life of privation and penance ; there it would have been all enjoyment . as to the pretence of trying her native air , i look upon that as a mere excuse.—in the summer it might have passed ; but what can any body ’ s native air do for them in the months of january , february , and march ? good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health , and i dare say in her ’ s . i do not require you to adopt all my suspicions , though you make so noble a profession of doing it , but i honestly tell you what they are . ”
austen	emma	“ my dear miss woodhouse , a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act . you and i need not be afraid . if _we_ set the example , many will follow it as far as they can ; though all have not our situations . _we_ have carriages to fetch and convey her home , and _we_ live in a style which could not make the addition of jane fairfax , at any time , the least inconvenient.—i should be extremely displeased if wright were to send us up such a dinner , as could make me regret having asked _more_ than jane fairfax to partake of it . i have no idea of that sort of thing . it is not likely that i _should_ , considering what i have been used to . my greatest danger , perhaps , in housekeeping , may be quite the other way , in doing too much , and being too careless of expense . maple grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be—for we do not at all affect to equal my brother , mr. suckling , in income.—however , my resolution is taken as to noticing jane fairfax.—i shall certainly have her very often at my house , shall introduce her wherever i can , shall have musical parties to draw out her talents , and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation . my acquaintance is so very extensive , that i have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly.—i shall introduce her , of course , very particularly to my brother and sister when they come to us . i am sure they will like her extremely ; and when she gets a little acquainted with them , her fears will completely wear off , for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating.—i shall have her very often indeed while they are with me , and i dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouche-landau in some of our exploring parties . ”
austen	emma	“ there might be scruples of delicacy , my dear emma . i have a very strong notion that it comes from him . i am sure he was particularly silent when mrs. cole told us of it at dinner . ”
austen	emma	the result of this distress was , that , with a much more voluntary , cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment , she was able to fix her wedding-day—and mr. elton was called on , within a month from the marriage of mr. and mrs. robert martin , to join the hands of mr. knightley and miss woodhouse .
austen	emma	“ oh ! very delightful indeed ; i can say nothing less , for i suppose miss woodhouse and mr. frank churchill are hearing every thing that passes . and ( raising his voice still more ) i do not see why miss fairfax should not be mentioned too . i think miss fairfax dances very well ; and mrs. weston is the very best country-dance player , without exception , in england . now , if your friends have any gratitude , they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return ; but i can not stay to hear it . ”
austen	emma	in the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast , that the party to box hill was again under happy consideration ; and at last donwell was settled for one day , and box hill for the next , —the weather appearing exactly right .
austen	emma	she looked on with some amusement.—miss bates ’ s gratitude for mrs. elton ’ s attentions to jane was in the first style of guileless simplicity and warmth . she was quite one of her worthies—the most amiable , affable , delightful woman—just as accomplished and condescending as mrs. elton meant to be considered . emma ’ s only surprize was that jane fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate mrs. elton as she seemed to do . she heard of her walking with the eltons , sitting with the eltons , spending a day with the eltons ! this was astonishing ! —she could not have believed it possible that the taste or the pride of miss fairfax could endure such society and friendship as the vicarage had to offer .
austen	emma	upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject , before the few who knew her opinion of mrs. elton , mrs. weston ventured this apology for jane . “ we can not suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the vicarage , my dear emma—but it is better than being always at home . her aunt is a good creature , but , as a constant companion , must be very tiresome . we must consider what miss fairfax quits , before we condemn her taste for what she goes to . ”
austen	emma	“ and i assure you , mr. weston , i have very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour . i have heard so much in praise of mr. frank churchill.—at the same time it is fair to observe , that i am one of those who always judge for themselves , and are by no means implicitly guided by others . i give you notice that as i find your son , so i shall judge of him.—i am no flatterer . ”
austen	emma	frank churchill returned to his station by emma ; and as soon as miss bates was quiet , she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of mrs. elton and miss fairfax , who were standing a little way behind her.—he was thoughtful . whether he were overhearing too , she could not determine . after a good many compliments to jane on her dress and look , compliments very quietly and properly taken , mrs. elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself—and it was , “ how do you like my gown ? —how do you like my trimming ? —how has wright done my hair ? ” —with many other relative questions , all answered with patient politeness . mrs. elton then said , “ nobody can think less of dress in general than i do—but upon such an occasion as this , when every body ’ s eyes are so much upon me , and in compliment to the westons—who i have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour—i would not wish to be inferior to others . and i see very few pearls in the room except mine.—so frank churchill is a capital dancer , i understand.—we shall see if our styles suit.—a fine young man certainly is frank churchill . i like him very well . ”
austen	emma	before he could return to his chair , it was taken by mrs. weston . “ this is the luxury of a large party , ” said she : — “ one can get near every body , and say every thing . my dear emma , i am longing to talk to you . i have been making discoveries and forming plans , just like yourself , and i must tell them while the idea is fresh . do you know how miss bates and her niece came here ? ”
austen	emma	“ to be sure ! ” cried she playfully . “ i know _that_ is the feeling of you all . i know that such a girl as harriet is exactly what every man delights in—what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment . oh ! harriet may pick and chuse . were you , yourself , ever to marry , she is the very woman for you . and is she , at seventeen , just entering into life , just beginning to be known , to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives ? no—pray let her have time to look about her . ”
austen	emma	mr. frank churchill was one of the boasts of highbury , and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed , though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life . his coming to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved .
austen	emma	mrs. weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion . her looks and words had nothing to restrain them . she was happy , she knew she was happy , and knew she ought to be happy . her congratulations were warm and open ; but emma could not speak so fluently . _she_ was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings , and trying to understand the degree of her agitation , which she rather thought was considerable .
austen	emma	the difference of harriet at mrs. goddard ’ s , or in london , made perhaps an unreasonable difference in emma ’ s sensations ; but she could not think of her in london without objects of curiosity and employment , which must be averting the past , and carrying her out of herself .
austen	emma	“ no ; not immediately here . we are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of ; and we are a very quiet set of people , i believe ; more disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure . ”
austen	emma	“ yes , indeed , a very good letter , ” replied emma rather slowly— “ so good a letter , harriet , that every thing considered , i think one of his sisters must have helped him . i can hardly imagine the young man whom i saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well , if left quite to his own powers , and yet it is not the style of a woman ; no , certainly , it is too strong and concise ; not diffuse enough for a woman . no doubt he is a sensible man , and i suppose may have a natural talent for—thinks strongly and clearly—and when he takes a pen in hand , his thoughts naturally find proper words . it is so with some men . yes , i understand the sort of mind . vigorous , decided , with sentiments to a certain point , not coarse . a better written letter , harriet ( returning it , ) than i had expected . ”
austen	emma	“ you think so , do you ? —i wanted the opinion of some one who could really judge . she appeared to me to play well , that is , with considerable taste , but i know nothing of the matter myself.—i am excessively fond of music , but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any body ’ s performance.—i have been used to hear her ’ s admired ; and i remember one proof of her being thought to play well : —a man , a very musical man , and in love with another woman—engaged to her—on the point of marriage—would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument , if the lady in question could sit down instead—never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other . that , i thought , in a man of known musical talent , was some proof . ”
austen	emma	“ oh ! no—there is nothing to surprize one at all.—a pretty fortune ; and she came in his way. ” “ i dare say , ” returned harriet , sighing again , “ i dare say she was very much attached to him . ”
austen	emma	“ jane fairfax is absolutely charming , miss woodhouse.—i quite rave about jane fairfax.—a sweet , interesting creature . so mild and ladylike—and with such talents ! —i assure you i think she has very extraordinary talents . i do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well . i know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point . oh ! she is absolutely charming ! you will laugh at my warmth—but , upon my word , i talk of nothing but jane fairfax.—and her situation is so calculated to affect one ! —miss woodhouse , we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her . we must bring her forward . such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown.—i dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet ,
austen	emma	“ much , indeed ! ” cried emma feelingly . “ if a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself , it is in a situation like jane fairfax ’ s.—of such , one may almost say , that ‘ the world is not their ’ s , nor the world ’ s law . ’ ”
austen	emma	real , long-standing regard brought the westons and mr. knightley ; and by mr. elton , a young man living alone without liking it , the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of mr. woodhouse ’ s drawing-room , and the smiles of his lovely daughter , was in no danger of being thrown away .
austen	emma	harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory ; and emma was only saved from raptures and fondness , which at that moment would have been dreadful penance , by the sound of her father ’ s footsteps . he was coming through the hall . harriet was too much agitated to encounter him . “ she could not compose herself— mr. woodhouse would be alarmed—she had better go ; ” —with most ready encouragement from her friend , therefore , she passed off through another door—and the moment she was gone , this was the spontaneous burst of emma ’ s feelings : “ oh god ! that i had never seen her ! ”
austen	emma	“ break it to me , ” cried emma , standing still with terror.— “ good god ! —mr . weston , tell me at once.—something has happened in brunswick square . i know it has . tell me , i charge you tell me this moment what it is . ”
austen	emma	emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of mr. martin ’ s prose . “ such sweet lines ! ” continued harriet— “ these two last ! —but how shall i ever be able to return the paper , or say i have found it out ? —oh ! miss woodhouse , what can we do about that ? ”
austen	emma	“ i am not fond of dinner-visiting , ” said he— “ i never was . no more is emma . late hours do not agree with us . i am sorry mr. and mrs. cole should have done it . i think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer , and take their tea with us—take us in their afternoon walk ; which they might do , as our hours are so reasonable , and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening . the dews of a summer evening are what i would not expose any body to . however , as they are so very desirous to have dear emma dine with them , and as you will both be there , and mr. knightley too , to take care of her , i can not wish to prevent it , provided the weather be what it ought , neither damp , nor cold , nor windy. ” then turning to mrs. weston , with a look of gentle reproach— “ ah ! miss taylor , if you had not married , you would have staid at home with me . ”
austen	emma	upon the whole , she was equally contented with her view of his feelings . “ _he_ is undoubtedly very much in love—every thing denotes it—very much in love indeed ! —and when he comes again , if his affection continue , i must be on my guard not to encourage it.—it would be most inexcusable to do otherwise , as my own mind is quite made up . not that i imagine he can think i have been encouraging him hitherto . no , if he had believed me at all to share his feelings , he would not have been so wretched . could he have thought himself encouraged , his looks and language at parting would have been different.—still , however , i must be on my guard . this is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is ; but i do not know that i expect it will ; i do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man—i do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy.—his feelings are warm , but i can imagine them rather changeable.—every consideration of the subject , in short , makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved.—i shall do very well again after a little while—and then , it will be a good thing over ; for they say every body is in love once in their lives , and i shall have been let off easily . ”
austen	emma	emma watched and decided , that with such feelings as were now shewn , it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting himself ; that he had not been acting a part , or making a parade of insincere professions ; and that mr. knightley certainly had not done him justice .
austen	emma	at last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the crown ; and being now almost facing the house where the bateses lodged , emma recollected his intended visit the day before , and asked him if he had paid it .
austen	emma	“ oh ! do come in . they will be so very happy to see you. ” “ no , no ; your room is full enough . i will call another day , and hear the pianoforte. ” “ well , i am so sorry ! —oh ! mr. knightley , what a delightful party last night ; how extremely pleasant.—did you ever see such dancing ? —was not it delightful ? —miss woodhouse and mr. frank churchill ; i never saw any thing equal to it . ”
austen	emma	emma was most agreeably surprized.—mr . elton ’ s absence just at this time was the very thing to be desired . she admired him for contriving it , though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it was announced . resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father , from which she was so pointedly excluded . she had not even a share in his opening compliments.—her name was not mentioned ; —and there was so striking a change in all this , and such an ill-judged solemnity of leave-taking in his graceful acknowledgments , as she thought , at first , could not escape her father ’ s suspicion .
austen	emma	chapter v “ i do not know what your opinion may be , mrs. weston , ” said mr. knightley , “ of this great intimacy between emma and harriet smith , but i think it a bad thing . ”
austen	emma	“ oh ! good i am sure.—i see it in your countenance . you are trying not to smile. ” “ i am afraid , ” said he , composing his features , “ i am very much afraid , my dear emma , that you will not smile when you hear it . ”
austen	emma	“ i do not pretend to fix on times or places , but i must tell you that i have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to her advantage . ”
austen	emma	“ very likely.—i think they are , without exception , the most vulgar girls in highbury. ” harriet had business at ford ’ s.—emma thought it most prudent to go with her . another accidental meeting with the martins was possible , and in her present state , would be dangerous .
austen	emma	“ i am not at all surprized at you , harriet . the service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart. ” “ service ! oh ! it was such an inexpressible obligation ! —the very recollection of it , and all that i felt at the time—when i saw him coming—his noble look—and my wretchedness before . such a change ! in one moment such a change ! from perfect misery to perfect happiness ! ”
austen	emma	“ ah ! madam , ” cried emma , “ if other children are at all like what i remember to have been myself , i should think five times the amount of what i have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions , dearly earned . ”
austen	emma	contrary to the usual course of things , mr. elton ’ s wanting to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion . his professions and his proposals did him no service . she thought nothing of his attachment , and was insulted by his hopes . he wanted to marry well , and having the arrogance to raise his eyes to her , pretended to be in love ; but she was perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for . there had been no real affection either in his language or manners . sighs and fine words had been given in abundance ; but she could hardly devise any set of expressions , or fancy any tone of voice , less allied with real love . she need not trouble herself to pity him . he only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself ; and if miss woodhouse of hartfield , the heiress of thirty thousand pounds , were not quite so easily obtained as he had fancied , he would soon try for miss somebody else with twenty , or with ten .
austen	emma	the cold repast was over , and the party were to go out once more to see what had not yet been seen , the old abbey fish-ponds ; perhaps get as far as the clover , which was to be begun cutting on the morrow , or , at any rate , have the pleasure of being hot , and growing cool again.—mr . woodhouse , who had already taken his little round in the highest part of the gardens , where no damps from the river were imagined even by him , stirred no more ; and his daughter resolved to remain with him , that mrs. weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety which her spirits seemed to need .
austen	emma	at this moment , an ingenious and animating suspicion entering emma ’ s brain with regard to jane fairfax , this charming mr. dixon , and the not going to ireland , she said , with the insidious design of farther discovery ,
austen	emma	she now resolved to keep harriet no longer in the dark . she had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold , and it was desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before the gentleman ’ s return . she went to mrs. goddard ’ s accordingly the very next day , to undergo the necessary penance of communication ; and a severe one it was.—she had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding—to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred—and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis-judging in all her ideas on one subject , all her observations , all her convictions , all her prophecies for the last six weeks .
austen	emma	emma ’ s politeness was at hand directly , to say , with smiling interest— “ have you heard from miss fairfax so lately ? i am extremely happy . i hope she is well ? ” “ thank you . you are so kind ! ” replied the happily deceived aunt , while eagerly hunting for the letter.— “ oh ! here it is . i was sure it could not be far off ; but i had put my huswife upon it , you see , without being aware , and so it was quite hid , but i had it in my hand so very lately that i was almost sure it must be on the table . i was reading it to mrs. cole , and since she went away , i was reading it again to my mother , for it is such a pleasure to her—a letter from jane—that she can never hear it often enough ; so i knew it could not be far off , and here it is , only just under my huswife—and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says ; —but , first of all , i really must , in justice to jane , apologise for her writing so short a letter—only two pages you see—hardly two—and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half . my mother often wonders that i can make it out so well . she often says , when the letter is first opened , ‘ well , hetty , now i think you will be put to it to make out all that checker-work ’ —don ’ t you , ma ’ am ? —and then i tell her , i am sure she would contrive to make it out herself , if she had nobody to do it for her—every word of it—i am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word . and , indeed , though my mother ’ s eyes are not so good as they were , she can see amazingly well still , thank god ! with the help of spectacles . it is such a blessing ! my mother ’ s are really very good indeed . jane often says , when she is here , ‘ i am sure , grandmama , you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do—and so much fine work as you have done too ! —i only wish my eyes may last me as well . ’ ”
austen	emma	“ engaged since october , —secretly engaged.—it has hurt me , emma , very much . it has hurt his father equally . _some_ _part_ of his conduct we can not excuse. ” emma pondered a moment , and then replied , “ i will not pretend _not_ to understand you ; and to give you all the relief in my power , be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me , as you are apprehensive of . ”
austen	emma	“ jane fairfax has feeling , ” said mr. knightley— “ i do not accuse her of want of feeling . her sensibilities , i suspect , are strong—and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance , patience , self-control ; but it wants openness . she is reserved , more reserved , i think , than she used to be—and i love an open temper . no—till cole alluded to my supposed attachment , it had never entered my head . i saw jane fairfax and conversed with her , with admiration and pleasure always—but with no thought beyond . ”
austen	emma	“ i am ready , ” said emma , “ whenever i am wanted. ” “ whom are you going to dance with ? ” asked mr. knightley . she hesitated a moment , and then replied , “ with you , if you will ask me . ”
austen	emma	“ certainly , if you wish it ; —but you are not going to walk to highbury alone ? ” “ yes—what should hurt me ? —i walk fast . i shall be at home in twenty minutes. ” “ but it is too far , indeed it is , to be walking quite alone . let my father ’ s servant go with you.—let me order the carriage . it can be round in five minutes . ”
austen	emma	“ do you ? —i have no doubt . nature gave you understanding : —miss taylor gave you principles . you must have done well . my interference was quite as likely to do harm as good . it was very natural for you to say , what right has he to lecture me ? —and i am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner . i do not believe i did you any good . the good was all to myself , by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me . i could not think about you so much without doating on you , faults and all ; and by dint of fancying so many errors , have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least . ”
austen	emma	so began miss bates ; and mr. knightley seemed determined to be heard in his turn , for most resolutely and commandingly did he say , “ how is your niece , miss bates ? —i want to inquire after you all , but particularly your niece . how is miss fairfax ? —i hope she caught no cold last night . how is she to-day ? tell me how miss fairfax is . ”
austen	emma	chapter xviii “ i hope i shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you , ” said mr. weston . mrs. elton , very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her by such a hope , smiled most graciously .
austen	emma	“ well , ” said mrs. weston , smiling , “ you give him credit for more simple , disinterested benevolence in this instance than i do ; for while miss bates was speaking , a suspicion darted into my head , and i have never been able to get it out again . the more i think of it , the more probable it appears . in short , i have made a match between mr. knightley and jane fairfax . see the consequence of keeping you company ! —what do you say to it ? ”
austen	emma	miss bates looked about her , so happily— ! “ he promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from knightley ; but he and knightley are shut up together in deep consultation.—mr . e. is knightley ’ s right hand . ”
austen	emma	“ jane ! ” —repeated frank churchill , with a look of surprize and displeasure.— “ that is easy—but miss fairfax does not disapprove it , i suppose. ” “ how do you like mrs. elton ? ” said emma in a whisper .
austen	emma	“ i shall never be invited to abbey-mill again , ” was said in rather a sorrowful tone . “ nor , if you were , could i ever bear to part with you , my harriet . you are a great deal too necessary at hartfield to be spared to abbey-mill . ”
austen	emma	“ you , sir , may say any thing , ” cried mr. elton , “ but i must confess that i regard it as a most happy thought , the placing of miss smith out of doors ; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit ! any other situation would have been much less in character . the naïveté of miss smith ’ s manners—and altogether—oh , it is most admirable ! i can not keep my eyes from it . i never saw such a likeness . ”
austen	emma	“ ah ! my dear , but perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any good ; and as to myself , i have been long perfectly convinced , though perhaps i never told you so before , that the sea is very rarely of use to any body . i am sure it almost killed me once . ”
austen	emma	emma made no answer , and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned , but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone . she did not repent what she had done ; she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be ; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general , which made her dislike having it so loudly against her ; and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state , was very disagreeable . some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence , with only one attempt on emma ’ s side to talk of the weather , but he made no answer . he was thinking . the result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words .
austen	emma	chapter x though now the middle of december , there had yet been no weather to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise ; and on the morrow , emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family , who lived a little way out of highbury .
austen	emma	the speech was more to emma than to harriet , which emma could understand . there was deep consciousness about him , and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend ’ s . he was gone the next moment : —after another moment ’ s pause ,
austen	emma	“ it is not very likely , my dear , that bathing should have been of use to her—and if i had known you were wanting an embrocation , i would have spoken to—
austen	emma	“ i am happy you approved , ” said emma , smiling ; “ but i hope i am not often deficient in what is due to guests at hartfield. ” “ no , my dear , ” said her father instantly ; “ _that_ i am sure you are not . there is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are . if any thing , you are too attentive . the muffin last night—if it had been handed round once , i think it would have been enough . ”
austen	emma	she was obliged to repeat and explain it , before it was fully comprehended ; and then , being quite new , farther representations were necessary to make it acceptable . “ no ; he thought it very far from an improvement—a very bad plan—much worse than the other . a room at an inn was always damp and dangerous ; never properly aired , or fit to be inhabited . if they must dance , they had better dance at randalls . he had never been in the room at the crown in his life—did not know the people who kept it by sight.—oh ! no—a very bad plan . they would catch worse colds at the crown than anywhere . ”
austen	emma	“ i can not rate her beauty as you do , ” said he ; “ but she is a pretty little creature , and i am inclined to think very well of her disposition . her character depends upon those she is with ; but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman . ”
austen	emma	“ upon my word i never heard of it till this moment. ” “ never ! really , never ! —bless me ! how could it be ? —then i must have dreamt it—but i was completely persuaded—miss smith , you walk as if you were tired . you will not be sorry to find yourself at home . ”
austen	emma	chapter xii till now that she was threatened with its loss , emma had never known how much of her happiness depended on being _first_ with mr. knightley , first in interest and affection.—satisfied that it was so , and feeling it her due , she had enjoyed it without reflection ; and only in the dread of being supplanted , found how inexpressibly important it had been.—long , very long , she felt she had been first ; for , having no female connexions of his own , there had been only isabella whose claims could be compared with hers , and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed isabella . she had herself been first with him for many years past . she had not deserved it ; she had often been negligent or perverse , slighting his advice , or even wilfully opposing him , insensible of half his merits , and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own—but still , from family attachment and habit , and thorough excellence of mind , he had loved her , and watched over her from a girl , with an endeavour to improve her , and an anxiety for her doing right , which no other creature had at all shared . in spite of all her faults , she knew she was dear to him ; might she not say , very dear ? —when the suggestions of hope , however , which must follow here , presented themselves , she could not presume to indulge them . harriet smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly , exclusively , passionately loved by mr. knightley . _she_ could not . she could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment to _her_ . she had received a very recent proof of its impartiality.—how shocked had he been by her behaviour to miss bates ! how directly , how strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subject ! —not too strongly for the offence—but far , far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and clear-sighted goodwill.—she had no hope , nothing to deserve the name of hope , that he could have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question ; but there was a hope ( at times a slight one , at times much stronger , ) that harriet might have deceived herself , and be overrating his regard for _her_.—wish it she must , for his sake—be the consequence nothing to herself , but his remaining single all his life . could she be secure of that , indeed , of his never marrying at all , she believed she should be perfectly satisfied.—let him but continue the same mr. knightley to her and her father , the same mr. knightley to all the world ; let donwell and hartfield lose none of their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence , and her peace would be fully secured.—marriage , in fact , would not do for her . it would be incompatible with what she owed to her father , and with what she felt for him . nothing should separate her from her father . she would not marry , even if she were asked by mr. knightley .
austen	emma	emma ’ s first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of what had passed , —aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion : but she soon felt that concealment must be impossible . within half an hour it was known all over highbury . it was the very event to engage those who talk most , the young and the low ; and all the youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of frightful news . the last night ’ s ball seemed lost in the gipsies . poor mr. woodhouse trembled as he sat , and , as emma had foreseen , would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again . it was some comfort to him that many inquiries after himself and miss woodhouse ( for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after ) , as well as miss smith , were coming in during the rest of the day ; and he had the pleasure of returning for answer , that they were all very indifferent—which , though not exactly true , for she was perfectly well , and harriet not much otherwise , emma would not interfere with . she had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man , for she hardly knew what indisposition was ; and if he did not invent illnesses for her , she could make no figure in a message .
austen	emma	chapter xvi it was a very great relief to emma to find harriet as desirous as herself to avoid a meeting . their intercourse was painful enough by letter . how much worse , had they been obliged to meet !
austen	emma	“ yes , ” said harriet earnestly , “ and well she might , nobody could ever have a better . well , i wish them happy with all my heart . and now , miss woodhouse , i do not think i shall mind seeing them again . he is just as superior as ever ; —but being married , you know , it is quite a different thing . no , indeed , miss woodhouse , you need not be afraid ; i can sit and admire him now without any great misery . to know that he has not thrown himself away , is such a comfort ! —she does seem a charming young woman , just what he deserves . happy creature ! he called her ‘ augusta. ’ how delightful ! ”
austen	emma	she had had many a hint from mr. knightley and some from her own heart , as to her deficiency—but none were equal to counteract the persuasion of its being very disagreeable , —a waste of time—tiresome women—and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second-rate and third-rate of highbury , who were calling on them for ever , and therefore she seldom went near them . but now she made the sudden resolution of not passing their door without going in—observing , as she proposed it to harriet , that , as well as she could calculate , they were just now quite safe from any letter from jane fairfax .
austen	emma	“ you will make my excuses , my dear , as civilly as possible . you will say that i am quite an invalid , and go no where , and therefore must decline their obliging invitation ; beginning with my _compliments_ , of course . but you will do every thing right . i need not tell you what is to be done . we must remember to let james know that the carriage will be wanted on tuesday . i shall have no fears for you with him . we have never been there above once since the new approach was made ; but still i have no doubt that james will take you very safely . and when you get there , you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again ; and you had better name an early hour . you will not like staying late . you will get very tired when tea is over . ”
austen	emma	“ i hope not _that_.—it is not likely . no , mr. knightley , do not foretell vexation from that quarter. ” “ not i , indeed . i only name possibilities . i do not pretend to emma ’ s genius for foretelling and guessing . i hope , with all my heart , the young man may be a weston in merit , and a churchill in fortune.—but harriet smith—i have not half done about harriet smith . i think her the very worst sort of companion that emma could possibly have . she knows nothing herself , and looks upon emma as knowing every thing . she is a flatterer in all her ways ; and so much the worse , because undesigned . her ignorance is hourly flattery . how can emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself , while harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority ? and as for harriet , i will venture to say that _she_ can not gain by the acquaintance . hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to . she will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home . i am much mistaken if emma ’ s doctrines give any strength of mind , or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in life.—they only give a little polish . ”
austen	emma	emma remained in a state of vexation too ; but there was more indistinctness in the causes of her ’ s , than in his . she did not always feel so absolutely satisfied with herself , so entirely convinced that her opinions were right and her adversary ’ s wrong , as mr. knightley . he walked off in more complete self-approbation than he left for her . she was not so materially cast down , however , but that a little time and the return of harriet were very adequate restoratives . harriet ’ s staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy . the possibility of the young man ’ s coming to mrs. goddard ’ s that morning , and meeting with harriet and pleading his own cause , gave alarming ideas . the dread of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness ; and when harriet appeared , and in very good spirits , and without having any such reason to give for her long absence , she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind , and convinced her , that let mr. knightley think or say what he would , she had done nothing which woman ’ s friendship and woman ’ s feelings would not justify .
austen	emma	she spoke with a confidence which staggered , with a satisfaction which silenced , mr. knightley . she was in gay spirits , and would have prolonged the conversation , wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions , every look described , and all the wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly entertained her : but his gaiety did not meet hers . he found he could not be useful , and his feelings were too much irritated for talking . that he might not be irritated into an absolute fever , by the fire which mr. woodhouse ’ s tender habits required almost every evening throughout the year , he soon afterwards took a hasty leave , and walked home to the coolness and solitude of donwell abbey .
austen	emma	“ if you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women , and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with them , as you are where these children are concerned , we might always think alike . ”
austen	emma	“ now he has got my letter , ” said she softly . “ i wonder what they are all doing—whether his sisters know—if he is unhappy , they will be unhappy too . i hope he will not mind it so very much . ”
austen	emma	they were just approaching the house where lived mrs. and miss bates . she determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers . there was always sufficient reason for such an attention ; mrs. and miss bates loved to be called on , and she knew she was considered by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her , as rather negligent in that respect , and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of their scanty comforts .
austen	emma	“ i have always admired her complexion , ” replied emma , archly ; “ but do not i remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale ? —when we first began to talk of her.—have you quite forgotten ? ”
austen	emma	“ he writes like a sensible man , ” replied emma , when she had read the letter . “ i honour his sincerity . it is very plain that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side , but that he is not without hope of my growing , in time , as worthy of your affection , as you think me already . had he said any thing to bear a different construction , i should not have believed him . ”
austen	emma	mr. knightley , in fact , was one of the few people who could see faults in emma woodhouse , and the only one who ever told her of them : and though this was not particularly agreeable to emma herself , she knew it would be so much less so to her father , that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body .
austen	emma	emma soon recollected , and understood him ; and while she joined in the laugh , it was evident from jane ’ s countenance that she too was really hearing him , though trying to seem deaf .
austen	emma	“ oh ! now you are looking very sly . but consider—you need not be afraid of delegating power to _me_ . i am no young lady on her preferment . married women , you know , may be safely authorised . it is my party . leave it all to me . i will invite your guests . ”
austen	emma	harriet would have been a better match . if not wise or refined herself , she would have connected him with those who were ; but miss hawkins , it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit , had been the best of her own set . the rich brother-in-law near bristol was the pride of the alliance , and his place and his carriages were the pride of him .
austen	emma	“ i am sure you were of use to me , ” cried emma . “ i was very often influenced rightly by you—oftener than i would own at the time . i am very sure you did me good . and if poor little anna weston is to be spoiled , it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me , except falling in love with her when she is thirteen . ”
austen	emma	“ here comes this dear old beau of mine , i protest ! —only think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men ! —what a dear creature he is ; —i assure you i like him excessively . i admire all that quaint , old-fashioned politeness ; it is much more to my taste than modern ease ; modern ease often disgusts me . but this good old mr. woodhouse , i wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner . oh ! i assure you i began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous . i fancy i am rather a favourite ; he took notice of my gown . how do you like it ? —selina ’ s choice—handsome , i think , but i do not know whether it is not over-trimmed ; i have the greatest dislike to the idea of being over-trimmed—quite a horror of finery . i must put on a few ornaments now , because it is expected of me . a bride , you know , must appear like a bride , but my natural taste is all for simplicity ; a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery . but i am quite in the minority , i believe ; few people seem to value simplicity of dress , —show and finery are every thing . i have some notion of putting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin . do you think it will look well ? ”
austen	emma	“ perhaps miss fairfax has never been staying here so long before. ” “ or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument—which must now be shut up in london , untouched by any body . ”
austen	emma	mr. elton looked all happiness at this proposition ; and nothing could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage . the room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied , and looking forwards ; behind it was another with which it immediately communicated ; the door between them was open , and emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner . she was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found it ; but she fully intended that mr. elton should close it . it was not closed , however , it still remained ajar ; but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation , she hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room . for ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself . it could be protracted no longer . she was then obliged to be finished , and make her appearance .
austen	emma	mr. elton made his appearance . his lady greeted him with some of her sparkling vivacity . “ very pretty , sir , upon my word ; to send me on here , to be an encumbrance to my friends , so long before you vouchsafe to come ! —but you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with . you knew i should not stir till my lord and master appeared.—here have i been sitting this hour , giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal obedience—for who can say , you know , how soon it may be wanted ? ”
austen	emma	“ time , my dearest emma , time will heal the wound.—your own excellent sense—your exertions for your father ’ s sake—i know you will not allow yourself—. ” her arm was pressed again , as he added , in a more broken and subdued accent , “ the feelings of the warmest friendship—indignation—abominable scoundrel ! ” —and in a louder , steadier tone , he concluded with , “ he will soon be gone . they will soon be in yorkshire . i am sorry for _her_ . she deserves a better fate . ”
austen	emma	“ with a great deal of pleasure , sir , at any time , ” said mr. knightley , laughing , “ and i agree with you entirely , that it will be a much better thing . invite him to dinner , emma , and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken , but leave him to chuse his own wife . depend upon it , a man of six or seven-and-twenty can take care of himself . ”
austen	emma	“ this is most kind , indeed ! —miss woodhouse , it is impossible for me to express—i hope you will believe—excuse me for being so entirely without words. ” emma was gratified , and would soon have shewn no want of words , if the sound of mrs. elton ’ s voice from the sitting-room had not checked her , and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her congratulatory sensations into a very , very earnest shake of the hand .
austen	emma	chapter vi after being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from mr. and mrs. suckling , the highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn . no such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at present . in the daily interchange of news , they must be again restricted to the other topics with which for a while the sucklings ’ coming had been united , such as the last accounts of mrs. churchill , whose health seemed every day to supply a different report , and the situation of mrs. weston , whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child , as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it .
austen	emma	“ where—may i ask ? —is miss fairfax going ? ” “ to a mrs. smallridge—charming woman—most superior—to have the charge of her three little girls—delightful children . impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort ; if we except , perhaps , mrs. suckling ’ s own family , and mrs. bragge ’ s ; but mrs. smallridge is intimate with both , and in the very same neighbourhood : —lives only four miles from maple grove . jane will be only four miles from maple grove . ”
austen	emma	mrs. weston was disappointed . “ i thought you meant to go with me . they would be very much pleased. ” “ me ! i should be quite in the way . but , perhaps—i may be equally in the way here . miss woodhouse looks as if she did not want me . my aunt always sends me off when she is shopping . she says i fidget her to death ; and miss woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same . what am i to do ? ”
austen	emma	“ a sore-throat ! —i hope not infectious . i hope not of a putrid infectious sort . has perry seen her ? indeed you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend . let me entreat you to run no risks . why does not perry see her ? ”
austen	emma	“ yes , ” said emma , “ i hope i do. ” “ how i could so long a time be fancying myself ! ... ” cried harriet , warmly . “ it seems like madness ! i can see nothing at all extraordinary in him now.—i do not care whether i meet him or not—except that of the two i had rather not see him—and indeed i would go any distance round to avoid him—but i do not envy his wife in the least ; i neither admire her nor envy her , as i have done : she is very charming , i dare say , and all that , but i think her very ill-tempered and disagreeable—i shall never forget her look the other night ! —however , i assure you , miss woodhouse , i wish her no evil.—no , let them be ever so happy together , it will not give me another moment ’ s pang : and to convince you that i have been speaking truth , i am now going to destroy—what i ought to have destroyed long ago—what i ought never to have kept—i know that very well ( blushing as she spoke ) .—however , now i will destroy it all—and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence , that you may see how rational i am grown . can not you guess what this parcel holds ? ” said she , with a conscious look .
austen	emma	“ no great variety of faces for you , ” said emma . “ i had only my own family to study from . there is my father—another of my father—but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous , that i could only take him by stealth ; neither of them very like therefore . mrs. weston again , and again , and again , you see . dear mrs. weston ! always my kindest friend on every occasion . she would sit whenever i asked her . there is my sister ; and really quite her own little elegant figure ! —and the face not unlike . i should have made a good likeness of her , if she would have sat longer , but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four children that she would not be quiet . then , here come all my attempts at three of those four children ; —there they are , henry and john and bella , from one end of the sheet to the other , and any one of them might do for any one of the rest . she was so eager to have them drawn that i could not refuse ; but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know ; nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them , beyond the air and complexion , unless they are coarser featured than any of mama ’ s children ever were . here is my sketch of the fourth , who was a baby . i took him as he was sleeping on the sofa , and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see . he had nestled down his head most conveniently . that ’ s very like . i am rather proud of little george . the corner of the sofa is very good . then here is my last , ” —unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman in small size , whole-length— “ my last and my best—my brother , mr. john knightley.—this did not want much of being finished , when i put it away in a pet , and vowed i would never take another likeness . i could not help being provoked ; for after all my pains , and when i had really made a very good likeness of it— ( mrs. weston and i were quite agreed in thinking it _very_ like ) —only too handsome—too flattering—but that was a fault on the right side ” —after all this , came poor dear isabella ’ s cold approbation of— “ yes , it was a little like—but to be sure it did not do him justice . we had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all . it was made a great favour of ; and altogether it was more than i could bear ; and so i never would finish it , to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness , to every morning visitor in brunswick square ; —and , as i said , i did then forswear ever drawing any body again . but for harriet ’ s sake , or rather for my own , and as there are no husbands and wives in the case _at_ _present_ , i will break my resolution now . ”
austen	pride	“ it did . bingley is most unaffectedly modest . his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine made everything easy . i was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him . i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that i had known it , and purposely kept it from him . he was angry . but his anger , i am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister ’ s sentiments . he has heartily forgiven me now . ”
austen	pride	bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many inquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends . elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ; and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little . eager to be alone , and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley , and then hurried away to dress .
austen	pride	“ _that_ will make your ladyship ’ s situation at present more pitiable ; but it will have no effect on _me_. ” “ i will not be interrupted ! hear me in silence . my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other . they are descended , on the maternal side , from the same noble line ; and , on the father ’ s , from respectable , honourable , and ancient , though untitled , families . their fortune on both sides is splendid . they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses ; and what is to divide them ? -- the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune ! is this to be endured ? but it must not , shall not be ! if you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up . ”
austen	pride	her sister made not the smallest objection , and the pianoforte was opened ; and darcy , after a few moments ’ recollection , was not sorry for it . he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention .
austen	pride	“ yes , there can ; for mine is totally different . will you hear it ? ” “ most willingly. ” “ you shall have it in a few words . miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy . she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you . ”
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ lizzy , my dear , i want to speak to you. ” ] chapter lv . [ illustration ] a few days after this visit , mr. bingley called again , and alone . his friend had left him that morning for london , but was to return home in ten days ’ time . he sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits . mrs. bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere .
austen	pride	in revolving lady catherine ’ s expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference . from what she had said of her resolution to prevent the marriage , it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce . she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_ whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side . with his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning .
austen	pride	“ if you believed it impossible to be true , ” said elizabeth , colouring with astonishment and disdain , “ i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far . what could your ladyship propose by it ? ”
austen	pride	however little mr. darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned , -- no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer .
austen	pride	elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to colonel fitzwilliam , “ your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word i say . i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit . indeed , mr. darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire -- and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too -- for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear . ”
austen	pride	she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment . elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley ’ s regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it . on their being joined by mr. bingley himself , elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before mr. collins came up to them , and told her with great exultation , that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery .
austen	pride	their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned ; and while mr. darcy was attending them to their carriage , miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth ’ s person , behaviour , and dress . but georgiana would not join her . her brother ’ s recommendation was enough to insure her favour : his judgment could not err ; and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth , as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable . when darcy returned to the saloon , miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister .
austen	pride	“ it was a subject which they could not mention before me. ” “ no ; it would have been strange if they had . but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves . well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better . _i_ should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me . ”
austen	pride	“ i must trouble you once more for congratulations . elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr. darcy . console lady catherine as well as you can . but , if i were you , i would stand by the nephew . he has more to give .
austen	pride	lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end . but at length , by elizabeth ’ s persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city .
austen	pride	“ and _that_ is quite impossible ; for he is now in the custody of his friend , and mr. darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london ! my dear aunt , how could you think of it ? mr. darcy may , perhaps , have _heard_ of such a place as gracechurch street , but he would hardly think a month ’ s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it ; and , depend upon it , mr. bingley never stirs without him . ”
austen	pride	“ i see no occasion for that . you and the girls may go -- or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better ; for as you are as handsome as any of them , mr. bingley might like you the best of the party . ”
austen	pride	“ your first position is false . they may wish many things besides his happiness : they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride . ”
austen	pride	“ well , and so , just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr. stone . and then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it . well , i was so frightened i did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day . but , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes ’ time , and then we all set out . however , i recollected afterwards , that if he _had_ been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for mr. darcy might have done as well . ”
austen	pride	it was some time , however , before a smile could be extorted from jane . “ i do not know when i have been more shocked , ” said she . “ wickham so very bad ! it is almost past belief . and poor mr. darcy ! dear lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered . such a disappointment ! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too ! and having to relate such a thing of his sister ! it is really too distressing , i am sure you must feel it so . ”
austen	pride	“ upon my word , ” said her ladyship , “ you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person . pray , what is your age ? ” “ with three younger sisters grown up , ” replied elizabeth , smiling , “ your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it . ”
austen	pride	“ yes ; and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement . _that_ is all settled. ” “ what is all settled ? ” repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare . “ and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth ? oh , that i knew how it was ! ”
austen	pride	the only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter .
austen	pride	“ is miss darcy much grown since the spring ? ” said miss bingley : “ will she be as tall as i am ? ” “ i think she will . she is now about miss elizabeth bennet ’ s height , or rather taller . ”
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ the officers of the -- -- shire ” [ _copyright 1894 by george allen._ ] ] mr. wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker .
austen	pride	“ what sort of a girl is miss darcy ? ” he shook his head . “ i wish i could call her amiable . it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy ; but she is too much like her brother , -- very , very proud . as a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ; and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement . but she is nothing to me now . she is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and , i understand , highly accomplished . since her father ’ s death her home has been london , where a lady lives with her , and superintends her education . ”
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ with an affectionate smile ” [ _copyright 1894 by george allen._ ] ] chapter li . [ illustration ] their sister ’ s wedding-day arrived ; and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself . the carriage was sent to meet them at -- -- , and they were to return in it by dinnertime . their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets -- and jane more especially , who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had _she_ been the culprit , and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure .
austen	pride	the dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of plate which mr. collins had promised ; and , as he had likewise foretold , he took his seat at the bottom of the table , by her ladyship ’ s desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater . he carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity ; and every dish was commended first by him , and then by sir william , who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said , in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear . but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them . the party did not supply much conversation . elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh -- the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all the dinnertime . mrs. jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she was indisposed . maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire .
austen	pride	mrs. hill began instantly to express her joy . elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom . poor lydia ’ s situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful . she felt it so ; and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness , nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister , in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained .
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ when the party entered ” [ _copyright 1894 by george allen._ ] ] being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball ; and a report soon followed that mr. bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly . the girls grieved over such a number of ladies ; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that , instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from london , his five sisters and a cousin . and when the party entered the assembly-room , it consisted of only five altogether : mr. bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man .
austen	pride	“ his guilt and his descent appear , by your account , to be the same , ” said elizabeth , angrily ; “ for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr. darcy ’ s steward , and of _that_ , i can assure you , he informed me himself . ”
austen	pride	“ you take an eager interest in that gentleman ’ s concerns , ” said darcy , in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour . “ who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him ? ”
austen	pride	jane looked well , and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them . but jane was to go home with her , and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation .
austen	pride	charlotte ’ s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth . “ ay , there she comes , ” continued mrs. bennet , “ looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at york , provided she can have her own way . but i tell you what , miss lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all -- and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead . _i_ shall not be able to keep you -- and so i warn you . i have done with you from this very day . i told you in the library , you know , that i should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word . i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children . not that i have much pleasure , indeed , in talking to anybody . people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking . nobody can tell what i suffer ! but it is always so . those who do not complain are never pitied . ”
austen	pride	elizabeth ’ s misery increased at such unnecessary , such officious attention ! were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , everything , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion . at that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion .
austen	pride	while settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door-bell ; and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to inquire particularly after her . but this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw mr. darcy walk into the room . in a hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better . she answered him with cold civility . he sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room . elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word . after a silence of several minutes , he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began : --
austen	pride	there was certainly at this moment , in elizabeth ’ s mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance . the commendation bestowed on him by mrs. reynolds was of no trifling nature . what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ? as a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people ’ s happiness were in his guardianship ! how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow ! how much of good or evil must be done by him ! every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character ; and as she stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before : she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression .
austen	pride	“ you expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine , but which i have never acknowledged . allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , miss bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety . ”
austen	pride	“ read it aloud , ” said their father , “ for i hardly know myself what it is about. ” / * right “ gracechurch street , _monday , august 2_ . * / “ my dear brother , “ at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , i hope will give you satisfaction . soon after you left me on saturday , i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were . the particulars i reserve till we meet . it is enough to know they are discovered : i have seen them both -- -- ”
austen	pride	“ are you not diverted ? ” “ oh , yes . pray read on. ” “ ‘ after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that , on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match . i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned. ’ mr. collins , moreover , adds , ‘ i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia ’ s sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known . i must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married . it was an encouragement of vice ; and had i been the rector of longbourn , i should very strenuously have opposed it . you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing. ’ _that_ is his notion of christian forgiveness ! the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte ’ s situation , and his expectation of a young olive-branch . but , lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it . you are not going to be _missish_ , i hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report . for what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? ”
austen	pride	she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and mrs. collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend ’ s dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power .
austen	pride	mr. wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia . at first there seemed danger of lydia ’ s engrossing him entirely , for she was a most determined talker ; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes , to have attention for anyone in particular . allowing for the common demands of the game , mr. wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with mr. darcy . she dared not even mention that gentleman . her curiosity , however , was unexpectedly relieved . mr. wickham began the subject himself . he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton ; and , after receiving her answer , asked in a hesitating manner how long mr. darcy had been staying there .
austen	pride	“ miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a london master . she has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to anne ’ s . anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . ”
austen	pride	mr. bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern , which was not in the least altered by her communication .
austen	pride	jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again . the promised letter of thanks from mr. collins arrived on tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelve-month ’ s abode in the family might have prompted . after discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , miss lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight ; for lady catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men .
austen	pride	elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room . “ i am astonished , ” said miss bingley , “ that my father should have left so small a collection of books . what a delightful library you have at pemberley , mr. darcy ! ”
austen	pride	“ i am , ” said he , with a firm voice . “ and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ? ” “ i hope not. ” “ it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first . ”
austen	pride	lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey ; and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary -- which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ; or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was . reflection must be reserved for solitary hours : whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ; and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections .
austen	pride	his plan did not vary on seeing them . miss bennet ’ s lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority ; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled choice . the next morning , however , made an alteration ; for in a quarter of an hour ’ s _tête-à-tête_ with mrs. bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn , produced from her , amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very jane he had fixed on . “ as to her _younger_ daughters , she could not take upon her to say -- she could not positively answer -- but she did not _know_ of any prepossession ; -- her _eldest_ daughter she must just mention -- she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged . ”
austen	pride	elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine , and his kind intention of christening , marrying , and burying his parishioners whenever it were required . “ he must be an oddity , i think , ” said she . “ i can not make him out . there is something very pompous in his style . and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail ? we can not suppose he would help it , if he could . can he be a sensible man , sir ? ”
austen	pride	“ nearly three weeks. ” “ and you saw him frequently ? ” “ yes , almost every day. ” “ his manners are very different from his cousin ’ s. ” “ yes , very different ; but i think mr. darcy improves on acquaintance . ”
austen	pride	“ you make me laugh , charlotte ; but it is not sound . you know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself. ” occupied in observing mr. bingley ’ s attention to her sister , elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend . mr. darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty : he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise . but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes . to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying . though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world , he was caught by their easy playfulness . of this she was perfectly unaware : to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with .
austen	pride	jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern . she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter . both sisters were uncomfortable enough . each felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their mother talked on of her dislike of mr. darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr. bingley ’ s friend , without being heard by either of them . but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be suspected by jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to show mrs. gardiner ’ s letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him . to jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merits she had undervalued ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what jane felt for bingley . her astonishment at his coming -- at his coming to netherfield , to longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire .
austen	pride	mrs. gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but elizabeth could not return it . “ and that , ” said mrs. reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , “ is my master -- and very like him . it was drawn at the same time as the other -- about eight years ago . ”
austen	pride	“ no , ” said her father . “ wickham ’ s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds : i should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship . ”
austen	pride	“ and so ended his affection , ” said elizabeth , impatiently . “ there has been many a one , i fancy , overcome in the same way . i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love ! ”
austen	pride	“ it is more than i engage for , i assure you. ” “ but consider your daughters . only think what an establishment it would be for one of them . sir william and lady lucas are determined to go , merely on that account ; for in general , you know , they visit no new comers . indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit him , if you do not . ”
austen	pride	“ may i ask to what these questions tend ? ” “ merely to the illustration of _your_ character , ” said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity . “ i am trying to make it out . ”
austen	pride	she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her . his understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes . it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both : by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved ; and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance .
austen	pride	heading to chapter vi . 27
austen	pride	had she found jane in any apparent danger , mrs. bennet would have been very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield . she would not listen , therefore , to her daughter ’ s proposal of being carried home ; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable . after sitting a little while with jane , on miss bingley ’ s appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour . bingley met them with hopes that mrs. bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected .
austen	pride	“ i leave it to yourself to determine , ” said mr. bennet . [ illustration ] chapter xxiv . [ illustration ] miss bingley ’ s letter arrived , and put an end to doubt . the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter , and concluded with her brother ’ s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country .
austen	pride	“ it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire . anything beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn , i suppose , would appear far. ” as he spoke there was a sort of smile , which elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , --
austen	pride	miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of hertfordshire : her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances , and urged the possibility of mistakes ; but by everybody else mr. darcy was condemned as the worst of men .
austen	pride	in spite of having been at st. james ’ s , sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look . elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly . lady catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly-marked features , which might once have been handsome . her air was not conciliating , nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank . she was not rendered formidable by silence : but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her self-importance , and brought mr. wickham immediately to elizabeth ’ s mind ; and , from the observation of the day altogether , she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented .
austen	pride	“ neglect ! i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place . charles , when you build _your_ house , i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley . ”
austen	pride	“ i would not be so fastidious as you are , ” cried bingley , “ for a kingdom ! upon my honour , i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening ; and there are several of them , you see , uncommonly pretty . ”
austen	pride	“ their conduct has been such , ” replied elizabeth , “ as neither you , nor i , nor anybody , can ever forget . it is useless to talk of it. ” it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened . they went to the library , therefore , and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her . he was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , --
austen	pride	after walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant , there chanced to be a little alteration . it originated in mrs. gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found elizabeth ’ s arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband ’ s . mr. darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together . after a short silence the lady first spoke . she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected -- “ for your housekeeper , ” she added , “ informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow ; and , indeed , before we left bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country. ” he acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling . “ they will join me early to-morrow , ” he continued , “ and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you , -- mr. bingley and his sisters . ”
austen	pride	before any answer could arrive from mr. collins , or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife , the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge . the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident . lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew ’ s letter , that charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over . at such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw mr. darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband . he bore it , however , with admirable calmness . he could even listen to sir william lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st. james ’ s , with very decent composure . if he did shrug his shoulders , it was not till sir william was out of sight .
austen	pride	“ no , nothing at all. ” “ a great deal of good management , depend upon it . yes , yes . _they_ will take care not to outrun their income . _they_ will never be distressed for money . well , much good may it do them ! and so , i suppose , they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead . they look upon it quite as their own , i dare say , whenever that happens . ”
austen	pride	“ no , not at all. ” “ what , none of you ? ” “ not one. ” “ that is very strange . but i suppose you had no opportunity . your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters . ”
austen	pride	elizabeth took up some needlework , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion . the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each .
austen	pride	“ we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , ” said elizabeth . “ the conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable ; but since then we have both , i hope , improved in civility . ”
austen	pride	all this was acknowledged to mrs. gardiner ; and , after relating the circumstances , she thus went on : -- “ i am now convinced , my dear aunt , that i have never been much in love ; for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion , i should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil . but my feelings are not only cordial towards _him_ , they are even impartial towards miss king . i can not find out that i hate her at all , or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl . there can be no love in all this . my watchfulness has been effectual ; and though i should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were i distractedly in love with him , i can not say that i regret my comparative insignificance . importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly . kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do . they are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain . ”
austen	pride	scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to rosings . mr. collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner , might not wholly overpower them .
austen	pride	elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced : their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgment , too , unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them . they were , in fact , very fine ladies ; not deficient in good-humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ; but proud and conceited . they were rather handsome ; had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town ; had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds ; were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank ; and were , therefore , in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others . they were of a respectable family in the north of england ; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother ’ s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade .
austen	pride	about the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ; and , after listening a moment , she heard somebody running upstairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her . she opened the door , and met maria in the landing-place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , --
austen	pride	mrs. gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends . this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself . “ what will be his surprise , ” thought she , “ when he knows who they are ! he takes them now for people of fashion . ”
austen	pride	“ and have you heard from him often ? ” “ we have heard only once . he wrote me a few lines on wednesday , to say that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which i particularly begged him to do . he merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention . ”
austen	pride	“ indeed , sir , i have not the least intention of dancing . i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner. ” mr. darcy , with grave propriety , requested to be allowed the honour of her hand , but in vain . elizabeth was determined ; nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion .
austen	pride	“ not yet , ” replied jane . “ but now that my dear uncle is come , i hope everything will be well. ” “ is my father in town ? ” “ yes , he went on tuesday , as i wrote you word . ”
austen	pride	she was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister ’ s spirits . jane was not happy . she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley . having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast ; and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity .
austen	pride	“ lizzy , my dear , i want to speak with you. ” elizabeth was forced to go . “ we may as well leave them by themselves , you know , ” said her mother as soon as she was in the hall . “ kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room . ”
austen	pride	mr. darcy ’ s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart . she studied every sentence ; and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different . when she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation : but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him , her anger was turned against herself ; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion . his attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect : but she could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again . in her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret : and in the unhappy defects of her family , a subject of yet heavier chagrin . they were hopeless of remedy . her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters ; and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil . elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia ; but while they were supported by their mother ’ s indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ? catherine , weak-spirited , irritable , and completely under lydia ’ s guidance , had been always affronted by their advice ; and lydia , self-willed and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing . they were ignorant , idle , and vain . while there was an officer in meryton , they would flirt with him ; and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn , they would be going there for ever .
austen	pride	“ there are very few people of whom so much can be said . you are lucky in having such a master. ” “ yes , sir , i know i am . if i were to go through the world , i could not meet with a better . but i have always observed , that they who are good-natured when children , are good-natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest tempered , most generous-hearted boy in the world . ”
austen	pride	his daughter ’ s request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the north , received at first an absolute negative . but jane and elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister ’ s feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so mildly , to receive her and her husband at longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished . and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to the north . when mr. bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that , as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to longbourn . elizabeth was surprised , however , that wickham should consent to such a scheme ; and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes .
austen	pride	“ it ought to be so ; it must be so , while he retains the use of his reason . but _your_ arts and allurements may , in a moment of infatuation , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family . you may have drawn him in . ”
austen	pride	when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty ; but her letters were always long expected , and always very short . those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ; that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as mrs. forster called her , and they were going to the camp ; and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less to be learnt , for her letters to kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public .
austen	pride	miss bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing mr. darcy in anything , and persevered , therefore , in requiring an explanation of his two motives . “ i have not the smallest objection to explaining them , ” said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak . “ you either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each other ’ s confidence , and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking : if the first , i should be completely in your way ; and if the second , i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire . ”
austen	pride	elizabeth , feeling really anxious , determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had : and as she was no horsewoman , walking was her only alternative . she declared her resolution .
austen	pride	“ now , ” said she , “ that this first meeting is over , i feel perfectly easy . i know my own strength , and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming . i am glad he dines here on tuesday . it will then be publicly seen , that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance . ”
austen	pride	elizabeth , to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation . her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all others . to caroline ’ s assertion of her brother ’ s being partial to miss darcy , she paid no credit . that he was really fond of jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ; and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution , which now made him the slave of his designing friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations . had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best ; but her sister ’ s was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself . it was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing . she could think of nothing else ; and yet , whether bingley ’ s regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends ’ interference ; whether he had been aware of jane ’ s attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ; whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister ’ s situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded .
austen	pride	“ you need not be frightened . i never heard any harm of her ; and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world . she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , mrs. hurst and miss bingley . i think i have heard you say that you know them . ”
austen	pride	“ yes , and her petticoat ; i hope you saw her petticoat , six inches deep in mud , i am absolutely certain , and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office . ”
austen	pride	he readily assured her of his secrecy , again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and , leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious parting look , went away .
austen	pride	they agreed that mrs. bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman ’ s conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together . after lamenting it , however , at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that mr. bingley would be soon down again , and soon dining at longbourn ; and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration , that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses .
austen	pride	“ how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr. darcy , for now they _do_ appear wholly undeserved. ” “ certainly . but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging . there is one point on which i want your advice . i want to be told whether i ought , or ought not , to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham ’ s character . ”
austen	pride	“ come , mr. wickham , we are brother and sister , you know . do not let us quarrel about the past . in future , i hope we shall be always of one mind. ” she held out her hand : he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house .
austen	pride	she followed her father to the fireplace , and they both sat down . he then said , -- “ i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly . as it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents . i did not know before that i had _two_ daughters on the brink of matrimony . let me congratulate you on a very important conquest . ”
austen	pride	she inquired after his sister , but could do no more . “ it is a long time , mr. bingley , since you went away , ” said mrs. bennet . he readily agreed to it . “ i began to be afraid you would never come back again . people _did_ say , you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas ; but , however , i hope it is not true . a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away . miss lucas is married and settled : and one of my own daughters . i suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the papers . it was in the ‘ times ’ and the ‘ courier , ’ i know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be . it was only said , ‘ lately , george wickham , esq. , to miss lydia bennet , ’ without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or anything . it was my brother gardiner ’ s drawing up , too , and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it . did you see it ? ”
austen	pride	[ illustration : the post ] chapter xlviii . [ illustration ] the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr. bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him . his family knew him to be , on all common occasions , a most negligent and dilatory correspondent ; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion . they were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send ; but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain . mr. gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off .
austen	pride	“ my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them ; by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents. ” “ your humility , mr. bingley , ” said elizabeth , “ must disarm reproof . ”
austen	pride	when that business was over , he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music . miss bingley moved with alacrity to the pianoforte , and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived , she seated herself .
austen	pride	elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart ; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry . mr. wickham began to speak on more general topics , meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter , especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry .
austen	pride	“ you are all kindness , madam ; but i believe we must abide by our original plan. ” lady catherine seemed resigned . “ mrs . collins , you must send a servant with them . you know i always speak my mind , and i can not bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves . it is highly improper . you must contrive to send somebody . i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing . young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life . when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer , i made a point of her having two men-servants go with her . miss darcy , the daughter of mr. darcy of pemberley , and lady anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner . i am excessively attentive to all those things . you must send john with the young ladies , mrs. collins . i am glad it occurred to me to mention it ; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone . ”
austen	pride	“ _that_ is a failing , indeed ! ” cried elizabeth . “ implacable resentment _is_ a shade in a character . but you have chosen your fault well . i really can not _laugh_ at it . you are safe from me . ”
austen	pride	the day of his and lydia ’ s departure soon came ; and mrs. bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth .
austen	pride	“ i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal . i wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind . but , perhaps , his sister does as well for the present ; and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her . ”
austen	pride	when the clock struck three , elizabeth felt that she must go , and very unwillingly said so . miss bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when jane testified such concern at parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present . elizabeth most thankfully consented , and a servant was despatched to longbourn , to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes .
austen	pride	if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , elizabeth ’ s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty . but if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for wickham , and that its ill success might , perhaps , authorize her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment . be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ; and in this early example of what lydia ’ s infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business . never since reading jane ’ s second letter had she entertained a hope of wickham ’ s meaning to marry her . no one but jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation . surprise was the least of all her feelings on this development . while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise , all astonishment , that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible . but now it was all too natural . for such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey .
austen	pride	“ so much love and eloquence ” 156
austen	pride	elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william , in which she was readily joined by jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of mr. collins , and the convenient distance of hunsford from london .
austen	pride	darcy only smiled ; and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again . she longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say ; and after a short silence mrs. bennet began repeating her thanks to mr. bingley for his kindness to jane , with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy . mr. bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required . she performed her part , indeed , without much graciousness , but mrs. bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage . upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward . the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit ; and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax mr. bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield .
austen	pride	darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence . “ when _my_ eyes were opened to his real character , oh ! had i known what i ought , what i dared to do ! but i knew not -- i was afraid of doing too much . wretched , wretched mistake ! ”
austen	pride	“ laugh as much as you choose , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion . my dearest lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr. darcy , to be treating his father ’ s favourite in such a manner , -- one whom his father had promised to provide for . it is impossible . no man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it . can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ? oh no . ”
austen	pride	he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law ; and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could .
austen	pride	but , in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of bingley ’ s being withheld from seeing jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless . it was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re-animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane ’ s attractions .
austen	pride	“ ay , that is because you have the right disposition . but that gentleman , ” looking at darcy , “ seemed to think the country was nothing at all. ” “ indeed , mamma , you are mistaken , ” said elizabeth , blushing for her mother . “ you quite mistook mr. darcy . he only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true . ”
austen	pride	in the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger . elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her . at last it arrested her -- and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr. darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her . she stood several minutes before the picture , in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery . mrs. reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father ’ s lifetime .
austen	pride	“ well , girls , ” said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , “ what say you to the day ? i think everything has passed off uncommonly well , i assure you . the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw . the venison was roasted to a turn -- and everybody said , they never saw so fat a haunch . the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucases ’ last week ; and even mr. darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done ; and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least . and , my dear jane , i never saw you look in greater beauty . mrs. long said so too , for i asked her whether you did not . and what do you think she said besides ? ‘ ah ! mrs. bennet , we shall have her at netherfield at last ! ’ she did , indeed . i do think mrs. long is as good a creature as ever lived -- and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome : i like them prodigiously . ”
austen	pride	“ indeed ! ” “ yes -- the late mr. darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift . he was my godfather , and excessively attached to me . i can not do justice to his kindness . he meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ; but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere . ”
austen	pride	mr. collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight , but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction . he was too happy , however , to need much attention ; and , luckily for the others , the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company . the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge , and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed .
austen	pride	“ if ! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ? has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ? do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ? ” “ i never heard that it was . ”
austen	pride	“ fitzwilliam darcy. ” [ illustration ] chapter xxxvi . [ illustration ] elizabeth , when mr. darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents . but such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited . her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined . with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded , that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal . with a strong prejudice against everything he might say , she began his account of what had happened at netherfield . she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension ; and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes . his belief of her sister ’ s insensibility she instantly resolved to be false ; and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice . he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ; his style was not penitent , but haughty . it was all pride and insolence .
austen	pride	“ yes : these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt-un better than commerce , but with respect to any other leading characteristic , i do not imagine that much has been unfolded . ”
austen	pride	“ meeting accidentally in town ” 256
austen	pride	elizabeth shook her head over this letter . it convinced her that accident only could discover to mr. bingley her sister ’ s being in town . four weeks passed away , and jane saw nothing of him . she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley ’ s inattention . after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ; but the shortness of her stay , and , yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow jane to deceive herself no longer . the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt : --
austen	pride	elizabeth answered only by a slight bow . her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr. bingley ’ s name had been last mentioned between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , _his_ mind was not very differently engaged .
austen	pride	she represented to her sister , as forcibly as possible , what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect . jane ’ s temper was not desponding ; and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that bingley would return to netherfield , and answer every wish of her heart .
austen	pride	“ good gracious ! lord bless me ! only think ! dear me ! mr. darcy ! who would have thought it ? and is it really true ? oh , my sweetest lizzy ! how rich and how great you will be ! what pin-money , what jewels , what carriages you will have ! jane ’ s is nothing to it -- nothing at all . i am so pleased -- so happy . such a charming man ! so handsome ! so tall ! oh , my dear lizzy ! pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before . i hope he will overlook it . dear , dear lizzy . a house in town ! everything that is charming ! three daughters married ! ten thousand a year ! oh , lord ! what will become of me ? i shall go distracted . ”
austen	pride	“ oh , ” cried elizabeth , “ i am exceedingly diverted . but it is so strange ! ” “ yes , _that_ is what makes it amusing . had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but _his_ perfect indifference and _your_ pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd ! much as i abominate writing , i would not give up mr. collins ’ s correspondence for any consideration . nay , when i read a letter of his , i can not help giving him the preference even over wickham , much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law . and pray , lizzy , what said lady catherine about this report ? did she call to refuse her consent ? ”
austen	pride	“ it may , perhaps , be pleasant , ” replied charlotte , “ to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded . if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark . there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself . we can all _begin_ freely -- a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement . in nine cases out of ten , a woman had better show _more_ affection than she feels . bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on . ”
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ they entered the breakfast room ” ] charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by kitty , who came to tell the same news ; and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room , where mrs. bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on miss lucas for her compassion , and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of her family . “ pray do , my dear miss lucas , ” she added , in a melancholy tone ; “ for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me ; i am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves . ”
austen	pride	“ you are very kind , sir , i am sure ; and i wish with all my heart it may prove so ; for else they will be destitute enough . things are settled so oddly . ”
austen	pride	she was roused from her seat and her reflections , by someone ’ s approach ; and , before she could strike into another path , she was overtaken by wickham . “ i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? ” said he , as he joined her .
austen	pride	“ will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ? ”
austen	pride	“ because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement. ” “ but i was embarrassed. ” “ and so was i. ” “ you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner . ”
austen	pride	“ i honour your circumspection . a fortnight ’ s acquaintance is certainly very little . one can not know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight . but if _we_ do not venture , somebody else will ; and after all , mrs. long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and , therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , i will take it on myself . ”
austen	pride	“ pray , miss eliza , are not the -- -- shire militia removed from meryton ? they must be a great loss to _your_ family. ” in darcy ’ s presence she dared not mention wickham ’ s name : but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment ’ s distress ; but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone . while she spoke , an involuntary glance showed her darcy with a heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes . had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy ’ s opinion , and , perhaps , to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps . not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy ’ s meditated elopement . to no creature had it been revealed , where secrecy was possible , except to elizabeth ; and from all bingley ’ s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own . he had certainly formed such a plan ; and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend .
austen	pride	“ you have a very small park here , ” returned lady catherine , after a short silence . “ it is nothing in comparison of rosings , my lady , i dare say ; but , i assure you , it is much larger than sir william lucas ’ s . ”
austen	pride	as for jane , _her_ anxiety under this suspense was , of course , more painful than elizabeth ’ s : but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing ; and between herself and elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to . but as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very ill-used . it needed all jane ’ s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity .
austen	pride	“ upon my word ! well , that was very decided , indeed -- that does seem as if -- but , however , it may all come to nothing , you know. ” “ _my_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_ , eliza , ” said charlotte . “ mr . darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ? poor eliza ! to be only just _tolerable_ . ”
austen	pride	“ you must not blame my aunt . lydia ’ s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , i could not rest till i knew the particulars . let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them . ”
austen	pride	with a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on leaving the dining-parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee . she was still very poorly , and elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself . on entering the drawing-room , she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them ; but suspecting them to be playing high , she declined it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself , for the short time she could stay below , with a book . mr. hurst looked at her with astonishment .
austen	pride	elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying . he immediately offered to fetch her others ; all that his library afforded .
austen	pride	“ i should like it beyond anything ! ” said her mother . “ and then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over . ”
austen	pride	“ i am sorry to hear _that_ ; but why did you not tell me so before ? if i had known as much this morning , i certainly would not have called on him . it is very unlucky ; but as i have actually paid the visit , we can not escape the acquaintance now . ”
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ no , no ; stay where you are ” [ _copyright 1894 by george allen._ ] ] “ have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity ? ” “ oh yes . do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley . put them next to your great-uncle the judge . they are in the same profession , you know , only in different lines . as for your elizabeth ’ s picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ? ”
austen	pride	but before they heard again from mr. gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from mr. collins ; which , as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ; and elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise . it was as follows : --
austen	pride	“ i have no reason , i assure you , ” said he , “ to be dissatisfied with my reception . mr. darcy seemed much pleased with the attention . he answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of lady catherine ’ s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily . it was really a very handsome thought . upon the whole , i am much pleased with him . ”
austen	pride	“ to yield readily -- easily -- to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit with you. ” “ to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either. ” “ you appear to me , mr. darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection . a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it . i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr. bingley . we may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance occurs , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon . but in general and ordinary cases , between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be argued into it ? ”
austen	pride	“ the first pleasing earnest of their welcome ” 345
austen	pride	“ if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as you . till i have your disposition , your goodness , i never can have your happiness . no , no , let me shift for myself ; and , perhaps , if i have very good luck , i may meet with another mr. collins in time . ”
austen	pride	“ my dear aunt , this is being serious indeed. ” “ yes , and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise. ” “ well , then , you need not be under any alarm . i will take care of myself , and of mr. wickham too . he shall not be in love with me , if i can prevent it . ”
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ _whenever she spoke in a low voice_ ” ] mrs. bennet was really in a most pitiable state . the very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of . the sight of miss lucas was odious to her . as her successor in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence . whenever charlotte came to see them , she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr. collins , was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as mr. bennet was dead . she complained bitterly of all this to her husband .
austen	pride	his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to netherfield . “ ’ tis an _etiquette_ i despise , ” said he . “ if he wants our society , let him seek it . he knows where we live . i will not spend _my_ hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again . ”
austen	pride	“ believe me , my dear miss elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections . you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother ’ s permission for this address . you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken . almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life . but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying -- and , moreover , for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as i certainly did . ”
austen	pride	mrs. philips ’ s vulgarity was another , and , perhaps , a greater tax on his forbearance ; and though mrs. philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley ’ s good-humour encouraged ; yet , whenever she _did_ speak , she must be vulgar . nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant . elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley .
austen	pride	“ lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . ”
austen	pride	“ indeed i have , sir , ” was her answer . “ she is a great deal too ill to be moved . mr. jones says we must not think of moving her . we must trespass a little longer on your kindness . ”
austen	pride	“ i can guess the subject of your reverie. ” “ i should imagine not. ” “ you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner , -- in such society ; and , indeed , i am quite of your opinion . i was never more annoyed ! the insipidity , and yet the noise -- the nothingness , and yet the self-importance , of all these people ! what would i give to hear your strictures on them ! ”
austen	pride	“ when i wrote that letter , ” replied darcy , “ i believed myself perfectly calm and cool ; but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit. ” “ the letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so . the adieu is charity itself . but think no more of the letter . the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten . you must learn some of my philosophy . think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure . ”
austen	pride	in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of the carriage , when , turning hastily round , she added , -- “ i take no leave of you , miss bennet . i send no compliments to your mother . you deserve no such attention . i am most seriously displeased . ”
austen	pride	“ oh , mr. collins ! ” “ my dear madam , ” replied he , “ let us be for ever silent on this point . far be it from me , ” he presently continued , in a voice that marked his displeasure , “ to resent the behaviour of your daughter . resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all : the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been , in early preferment ; and , i trust , i am resigned . perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for i have often observed , that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation . you will not , i hope , consider me as showing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter ’ s favour , without having paid yourself and mr. bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf . my conduct may , i fear , be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter ’ s lips instead of your own ; but we are all liable to error . i have certainly meant well through the whole affair . my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family ; and if my _manner_ has been at all reprehensible , i here beg leave to apologize . ”
austen	pride	“ just as you please. ” “ may we take my uncle ’ s letter to read to her ? ” “ take whatever you like , and get away. ” elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table , and they went upstairs together . mary and kitty were both with mrs. bennet : one communication would , therefore , do for all . after a slight preparation for good news , the letter was read aloud . mrs. bennet could hardly contain herself . as soon as jane had read mr. gardiner ’ s hope of lydia ’ s being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its exuberance . she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation . to know that her daughter would be married was enough . she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct .
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ such very superior dancing is not often seen. ” [ _copyright 1894 by george allen._ ] ] the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy ; but sir william ’ s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed , with a very serious expression , towards bingley and jane , who were dancing together . recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , --
austen	pride	on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn ; and the two who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen , were in very good time . when they repaired to the dining-room , elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister . her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , forbore to invite him to sit by herself . on entering the room , he seemed to hesitate ; but jane happened to look round , and happened to smile : it was decided . he placed himself by her .
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ jane happened to look round ” ] chapter liv . [ illustration ] as soon as they were gone , elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or , in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects which must deaden them more . mr. darcy ’ s behaviour astonished and vexed her .
austen	pride	“ good lord ! sir william , how can you tell such a story ? do not you know that mr. collins wants to marry lizzy ? ” nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment : but sir william ’ s good-breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy .
austen	pride	[ illustration : ·pride and prejudice· chapter i . ] it is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife . however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters .
austen	pride	their visitors stayed with them above half an hour ; and when they arose to depart , mr. darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr. and mrs. gardiner , and miss bennet , to dinner at pemberley , before they left the country . miss darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations , readily obeyed . mrs. gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how _she_ , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but elizabeth had turned away her head . presuming , however , that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on .
austen	pride	_for if her knowledge was not very extended , she knew two things which only genius knows . the one was humanity , and the other was art . on the first head she could not make a mistake ; her men , though limited , are true , and her women are , in the old sense , “ absolute. ” as to art , if she has never tried idealism , her realism is real to a degree which makes the false realism of our own day look merely dead-alive . take almost any frenchman , except the late m. de maupassant , and watch him laboriously piling up strokes in the hope of giving a complete impression . you get none ; you are lucky if , discarding two-thirds of what he gives , you can shape a real impression out of the rest . but with miss austen the myriad , trivial , unforced strokes build up the picture like magic . nothing is false ; nothing is superfluous . when ( to take the present book only ) mr. collins changed his mind from jane to elizabeth “ while mrs. bennet was stirring the fire ” ( and we know_ how _mrs . bennet would have stirred the fire ) , when mr. darcy “ brought his coffee-cup back_ himself , ” _the touch in each case is like that of swift -- “ taller by the breadth of my nail ” -- which impressed the half-reluctant thackeray with just and outspoken admiration . indeed , fantastic as it may seem , i should put miss austen as near to swift in some ways , as i have put her to addison in others._
austen	pride	“ i remember , when we first knew her in hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and i particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at netherfield , ‘ _she_ a beauty ! i should as soon call her mother a wit. ’ but afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . ”
austen	pride	“ it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably . we have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit can not have been entirely irksome . our situation with regard to lady catherine ’ s family is , indeed , the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast . you see on what a footing we are . you see how continually we are engaged there . in truth , i must acknowledge , that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , i should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings . ”
austen	pride	“ next time you call , ” said she , “ i hope we shall be more lucky. ” he should be particularly happy at any time , etc. , etc . ; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them .

austen	pride	but she had no reason to fear mr. and mrs. gardiner ’ s curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication . it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr. darcy than they had before any idea of ; it was evident that he was very much in love with her . they saw much to interest , but nothing to justify inquiry .
austen	pride	mr. collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies ; and sir william , to elizabeth ’ s high diversion , was stationed in the doorway , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way .
austen	pride	mr. bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , sarcastic humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character . _her_ mind was less difficult to develope . she was a woman of mean understanding , little information , and uncertain temper . when she was discontented , she fancied herself nervous . the business of her life was to get her daughters married : its solace was visiting and news .
austen	pride	“ he does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from mr. darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only. ” “ i have not a doubt of mr. bingley ’ s sincerity , ” said elizabeth warmly , “ but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only . mr. bingley ’ s defence of his friend was a very able one , i dare say ; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before . ”
austen	pride	elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command . she had ventured only one glance at darcy . he looked serious as usual ; and , she thought , more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at pemberley . but , perhaps , he could not in her mother ’ s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt . it was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture .
austen	pride	“ if we are ever able to learn what wickham ’ s debts have been , ” said elizabeth , “ and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what mr. gardiner has done for them , because wickham has not sixpence of his own . the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited . their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude can not enough acknowledge . by this time she is actually with them ! if such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy ! what a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! ”
austen	pride	“ how so ? how can it affect them ? ” “ my dear mr. bennet , ” replied his wife , “ how can you be so tiresome ? you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them . ”
austen	pride	“ good god ! what is the matter ? ” cried he , with more feeling than politeness ; then recollecting himself , “ i will not detain you a minute ; but let me , or let the servant , go after mr. and mrs. gardiner . you are not well enough ; you can not go yourself . ”
austen	pride	“ no , indeed , i felt nothing but surprise. ” “ your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you . my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness , and i confess that i did not expect to receive _more_ than my due . ”
austen	pride	their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first . the very last evening was spent there ; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of packing , and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way , that maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the work of the morning , and pack her trunk afresh .
austen	pride	“ had you then persuaded yourself that i should ? ” “ indeed i had . what will you think of my vanity ? i believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses. ” “ my manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally , i assure you . i never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong . how you must have hated me after _that_ evening ! ”
austen	pride	“ i hope mr. bingley will like it , lizzy. ” “ we are not in a way to know _what_ mr. bingley likes , ” said her mother , resentfully , “ since we are not to visit . ”
austen	pride	when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham ’ s departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment . their parties abroad were less varied than before ; and at home she had a mother and sister , whose constant repinings at the dulness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ; and , though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a watering-place and a camp . upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire , did not , in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself . it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment . her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts : it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable ; and could she have included jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect .
austen	pride	[ illustration ] chapter xxxiv . [ illustration ] when they were gone , elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr. darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent . they contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering . but in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards everyone , had been scarcely ever clouded . elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal . mr. darcy ’ s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sister ’ s sufferings . it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do .
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ i am determined never to speak of it again ” ] “ i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more. ” “ oh , well ! it is just as he chooses . nobody wants him to come ; though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and , if i was her , i would not have put up with it . well , my comfort is , i am sure jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done . ”
austen	pride	as they walked across the lawn towards the river , elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also ; and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables .
austen	pride	“ already arisen ! ” repeated mr. bennet . “ what ! has she frightened away some of your lovers ? poor little lizzy ! but do not be cast down . such squeamish youths as can not bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret . come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia ’ s folly . ”
austen	pride	the little gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock ; and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies , in a variety of capers and frisks , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome .
austen	pride	accordingly , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place , what was the name of its proprietor , and , with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer ? a most welcome negative followed the last question ; and her alarms being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme .
austen	pride	“ to oblige you , i would try to believe almost anything , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ; for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him , i should only think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart . my dear jane , mr. collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow-minded , silly man : you know he is , as well as i do ; and you must feel , as well as i do , that the woman who marries him can not have a proper way of thinking . you shall not defend her , though it is charlotte lucas . you shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger security for happiness . ”
austen	pride	“ but not before they went to brighton ? ” “ no , i believe not. ” “ and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself ? does he know his real character ? ” “ i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did . he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant ; and since this sad affair has taken place , it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt : but i hope this may be false . ”
austen	pride	“ i am determined never to speak of it again ” 283
austen	pride	[ illustration ] chapter xliv . [ illustration ] elizabeth had settled it that mr. darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley ; and was , consequently , resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning . but her conclusion was false ; for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton these visitors came . they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up the street . elizabeth , immediately recognizing the livery , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations , by acquainting them with the honour which she expected . her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business . nothing had ever suggested it before , but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece . while these newly-born notions were passing in their heads , the perturbation of elizabeth ’ s feelings was every moment increasing . she was quite amazed at her own discomposure ; but , amongst other causes of disquiet , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ; and , more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her .
austen	pride	then , turning to mr. bennet , he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon . mr. bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements . mrs. bennet and her daughters apologized most civilly for lydia ’ s interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would resume his book ; but mr. collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill-will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with mr. bennet , and prepared for backgammon .
austen	pride	“ if he does not come to me , _then_ , ” said she , “ i shall give him up for ever. ” the gentlemen came ; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ; but , alas ! the ladies had crowded round the table , where miss bennet was making tea , and elizabeth pouring out the coffee , in so close a confederacy , that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair . and on the gentlemen ’ s approaching , one of the girls moved closer to her than ever , and said , in a whisper , --
austen	pride	the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary ; nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from _that_ , -- though elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware that , had she known nothing of darcy , she could have borne the dread of lydia ’ s infamy somewhat better . it would have spared her , she thought , one sleepless night out of two .
austen	pride	“ the indirect boast ; for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which , if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting . the power of doing anything with quickness is always much prized by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance . when you told mrs. bennet this morning , that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself ; and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else ? ”
austen	pride	he took the hint and soon began with , “ this seems a very comfortable house . lady catherine , i believe , did a great deal to it when mr. collins first came to hunsford . ”
austen	pride	“ what ! is he coming home , and without poor lydia ? ” she cried . “ sure he will not leave london before he has found them . who is to fight wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? ”
austen	pride	“ yes , or i will never see her again. ” “ an unhappy alternative is before you , elizabeth . from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents . your mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry mr. collins , and i will never see you again if you _do_ . ”
austen	pride	“ now i am quite happy , ” said she , “ for you will be as happy as myself . i always had a value for him . were it for nothing but his love of you , i must always have esteemed him ; but now , as bingley ’ s friend and your husband , there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me . but , lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me . how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton ! i owe all that i know of it to another , not to you . ”
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ at the door ” ] chapter xxviii . [ illustration ] every object in the next day ’ s journey was new and interesting to elizabeth ; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment ; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight .
austen	pride	elizabeth said no more ; but her mind could not acquiesce . the possibility of meeting mr. darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred . it would be dreadful ! she blushed at the very idea ; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt , than to run such a risk . but against this there were objections ; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource , if her private inquiries as to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered .

austen	pride	[ illustration : m^ { rs } bennet and her two youngest girls [ _copyright 1894 by george allen._ ] ] chapter ix . [ illustration ] elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister ’ s room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from mr. bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters . in spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to longbourn , desiring her mother to visit jane , and form her own judgment of her situation . the note was immediately despatched , and its contents as quickly complied with . mrs. bennet , accompanied by her two youngest girls , reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast .
austen	pride	mr. darcy , who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise . his complexion became pale with anger , and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature . he was struggling for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it . the pause was to elizabeth ’ s feelings dreadful . at length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , --
austen	pride	in pompous nothings on his side , and civil assents on that of his cousins , their time passed till they entered meryton . the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_ . their eyes were immediately wandering up the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet , indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recall them .
austen	pride	without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , elizabeth , on finishing this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows : it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first .
austen	pride	she paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse . he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity .
austen	pride	“ your father ’ s estate is entailed on mr. collins , i think ? for your sake , ” turning to charlotte , “ i am glad of it ; but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line . it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh ’ s family . do you play and sing , miss bennet ? ”
austen	pride	mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached . elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the lucases , and two or three officers , joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room .
austen	pride	[ illustration ] chapter xv . [ illustration ] mr. collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father ; and though he belonged to one of the universities , he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful acquaintance . the subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner ; but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity . a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his veneration for her as his patroness , mingling with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his right as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness , self-importance and humility .
austen	pride	his behaviour to her sister was such during dinnertime as showed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded elizabeth , that , if left wholly to himself , jane ’ s happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured . though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour . it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ; for she was in no cheerful humour . mr. darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them . he was on one side of her mother . she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage . she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse ; but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did . her mother ’ s ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth ’ s mind ; and she would , at times , have given anything to be privileged to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family .
austen	pride	elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ; assuring him that mr. darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to mr. darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance . mr. collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , --
austen	pride	elizabeth ’ s spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr. collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr. bingley ’ s invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening ’ s amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke , either from the archbishop or lady catherine de bourgh , by venturing to dance .
austen	pride	“ it has been a very agreeable day , ” said miss bennet to elizabeth . “ the party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other . i hope we may often meet again . ”
austen	pride	“ if you are looking for my master , ma ’ am , he is walking towards the little copse. ” upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock .
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ they had forgotten to leave any message ” ] “ but , ” he added , “ you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here . ”
austen	pride	“ if my children are silly , i must hope to be always sensible of it. ” “ yes ; but as it happens , they are all of them very clever. ” “ this is the only point , i flatter myself , on which we do not agree . i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish . ”
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ piling up the fire ” [ _copyright 1894 by george allen._ ] ] chapter xi . [ illustration ] when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing-room , where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared . their powers of conversation were considerable . they could describe an entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit .
austen	pride	after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , mr. bennet coolly observed , -- “ from all that i can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the silliest girls in the country . i have suspected it some time , but i am now convinced . ”
austen	pride	mr. bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room : he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at netherfield . such amiable qualities must speak for themselves . what a contrast between him and his friend ! mr. darcy danced only once with mrs. hurst and once with miss bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party . his character was decided . he was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and everybody hoped that he would never come there again . amongst the most violent against him was mrs. bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters .
austen	pride	“ when i said that he improved on acquaintance , i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement ; but that , from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood . ”
austen	pride	“ oh , certainly , ” cried his faithful assistant , “ no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with . a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern languages , to deserve the word ; and , besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved . ”
austen	pride	“ no , i should have turned in a moment. ” and accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the parsonage together . “ do you certainly leave kent on saturday ? ” said she . “ yes -- if darcy does not put it off again . but i am at his disposal . he arranges the business just as he pleases . ”
austen	pride	“ mary and kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , i am sure , but i did not think it right for either of them . kitty is slight and delicate , and mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on . my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday , after my father went away ; and was so good as to stay till thursday with me . she was of great use and comfort to us all , and lady lucas has been very kind : she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us . ”
austen	pride	“ your plan is a good one , ” replied elizabeth , “ where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ; and if i were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , i dare say i should adopt it . but these are not jane ’ s feelings ; she is not acting by design . as yet she can not even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness . she has known him only a fortnight . she danced four dances with him at meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times . this is not quite enough to make her understand his character . ”
austen	pride	“ i had not thought mr. darcy so bad as this -- though i have never liked him , i had not thought so very ill of him -- i had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such inhumanity as this ! ”
austen	pride	after a few minutes ’ reflection , however , she continued , “ i _do_ remember his boasting one day , at netherfield , of the implacability of his resentments , of his having an unforgiving temper . his disposition must be dreadful . ”
austen	pride	“ and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry ? did he know of their intending to go off ? had colonel forster seen denny himself ? ” “ yes ; but when questioned by _him_ , denny denied knowing anything of their plan , and would not give his real opinion about it . he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying , and from _that_ i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before . ”
austen	pride	“ oh , my dear brother , ” replied mrs. bennet , “ that is exactly what i could most wish for . and now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , _make_ them marry . and as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them , after they are married . and , above all things , keep mr. bennet from fighting . tell him what a dreadful state i am in -- that i am frightened out of my wits ; and have such tremblings , such flutterings all over me , such spasms in my side , and pains in my head , and such beatings at my heart , that i can get no rest by night nor by day . and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses . oh , brother , how kind you are ! i know you will contrive it all . ”
austen	pride	“ will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again ? at present i have not room to do them justice. ” “ oh , it is of no consequence . i shall see her in january . but do you always write such charming long letters to her , mr. darcy ? ”
austen	pride	“ i am exceedingly gratified , ” said bingley , “ by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper . but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ; for he would certainly think the better of me if , under such a circumstance , i were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as i could . ”
austen	pride	“ nothing is more deceitful , ” said darcy , “ than the appearance of humility . it is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast. ” “ and which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty ? ”
austen	pride	[ illustration : m^ { r. } & m^ { rs . } bennet [ _copyright 1894 by george allen._ ] ] [ illustration : “ i hope mr. bingley will like it ” [ _copyright 1894 by george allen._ ] ] chapter ii . [ illustration ] mr. bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr. bingley . he had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it . it was then disclosed in the following manner . observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat , he suddenly addressed her with , --
austen	pride	“ if i , ” said mr. collins , “ were so fortunate as to be able to sing , i should have great pleasure , i am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman . i do not mean , however , to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to . the rector of a parish has much to do . in the first place , he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron . he must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he can not be excused from making as comfortable as possible . and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment . i can not acquit him of that duty ; nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family. ” and with a bow to mr. darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room . many stared -- many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than mr. bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended mr. collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed , in a half-whisper to lady lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man .
austen	pride	“ i can not be so easily reconciled to myself . the recollection of what i then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me . your reproof , so well applied , i shall never forget : ‘ had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner. ’ those were your words . you know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me ; though it was some time , i confess , before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice . ”
austen	pride	as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr. bingley ; and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane . she saw her in idea settled in that very house , in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable , under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like bingley ’ s two sisters . her mother ’ s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much . when they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( lady lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr. bingley . it was an animating subject , and mrs. bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match . his being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self-gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do . it was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as jane ’ s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and , lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked . it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than mrs. bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life . she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it .
austen	pride	they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday ; and mrs. bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good-humour and common politeness of bingley , in half an hour ’ s visit , had revived .
austen	pride	“ but if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required . a thousand things may arise in six months. ” the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt . it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline ’ s interested wishes ; and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone .
austen	pride	the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family . mrs. bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party . mr. bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters . jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be , though in a quieter way . elizabeth felt jane ’ s pleasure . mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball . they returned , therefore , in good spirits to longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants . they found mr. bennet still up . with a book , he was regardless of time ; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations . he had rather hoped that all his wife ’ s views on the stranger would be disappointed ; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear .
austen	pride	“ this is a most unfortunate affair , and will probably be much talked of . but we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation . ”
austen	pride	mr. bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it . mr. bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but , as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase .
austen	pride	and with these words he hastily left the room , and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house . the tumult of her mind was now painfully great . she knew not how to support herself , and , from actual weakness , sat down and cried for half an hour . her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it . that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr. darcy ! that he should have been in love with her for so many months ! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend ’ s marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible ! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection . but his pride , his abominable pride , his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane , his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner which he had mentioned mr. wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited .
austen	pride	“ how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november , mr. darcy ! it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr. bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if i recollect right , he went but the day before . he and his sisters were well , i hope , when you left london ? ”
austen	pride	as soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered ; and , after some contrivance , the whole party , with all their boxes , workbags , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of kitty ’ s and lydia ’ s purchases , were seated in it .
austen	pride	“ what do you mean , mr. bennet , by talking in this way ? you promised me to _insist_ upon her marrying him. ” “ my dear , ” replied her husband , “ i have two small favours to request . first , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ; and , secondly , of my room . i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be . ”
austen	pride	elizabeth , on her side , had much to do . she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ; and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were pre-possessed in her favour . bingley was ready , georgiana was eager , and darcy determined , to be pleased .
austen	pride	“ if he means to be but little at netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there . but , perhaps , mr. bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle . ”
austen	pride	elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ; for while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else : but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur . in the absence of jane , he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her ; and when bingley was gone , jane constantly sought the same means of relief .
austen	pride	the girls stared at their father . mrs. bennet said only , “ nonsense , nonsense ! ” “ what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ? ” cried he . “ do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ? i can not quite agree with you _there_ . what say you , mary ? for you are a young lady of deep reflection , i know , and read great books , and make extracts . ”
austen	pride	“ i am not afraid of you , ” said he , smilingly . “ pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , ” cried colonel fitzwilliam . “ i should like to know how he behaves among strangers . ”
austen	pride	“ he has made me so happy , ” said she , one evening , “ by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring ! i had not believed it possible . ”
austen	pride	with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did lydia , assisted by kitty ’ s hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn . elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham ’ s name .
austen	pride	“ yes , she did. ” “ and what did she say ? ” “ that you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had -- not turned out well . at such a distance as _that_ , you know , things are strangely misrepresented . ”
austen	pride	the observations of her uncle and aunt now began ; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected . “ he is perfectly well-behaved , polite , and unassuming , ” said her uncle .
austen	pride	[ illustration : the arrival of the gardiners ] chapter xlii . [ illustration ] had elizabeth ’ s opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort . her father , captivated by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good-humour which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her . respect , esteem , and confidence had vanished for ever ; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown . but mr. bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice . he was fond of the country and of books ; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments . to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement . this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife ; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given .
austen	pride	“ i am not now to learn , ” replied mr. collins , with a formal wave of the hand , “ that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time . i am , therefore , by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long . ”
austen	pride	“ that is right . you could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine : believe her to be deceived , by all means . you have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer . ”
austen	pride	elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory ; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect , and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him . but though everything seemed neat and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance ; and rather looked with wonder at her friend , that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion . when mr. collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not seldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte . once or twice she could discern a faint blush ; but in general charlotte wisely did not hear . after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to give an account of their journey , and of all that had happened in london , mr. collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself . to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures ; and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible . here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind . he could number the fields in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump . but of all the views which his garden , or which the country or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house . it was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground .
austen	pride	the communication excited many professions of concern ; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane ; and till the morrow their going was deferred . miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay ; for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other .
austen	pride	elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction ; and a moment ’ s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal , by incessant employment , the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion . mrs. bennet and kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone , mr. collins began , --
austen	pride	“ yes , vanity is a weakness indeed . but pride -- where there is a real superiority of mind -- pride will be always under good regulation. ” elizabeth turned away to hide a smile . “ your examination of mr. darcy is over , i presume , ” said miss bingley ; “ and pray what is the result ? ”
austen	pride	elizabeth was excessively disappointed : she had set her heart on seeing the lakes ; and still thought there might have been time enough . but it was her business to be satisfied -- and certainly her temper to be happy ; and all was soon right again .
austen	pride	when the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her , in return , by sitting down to whist . “ i know little of the game at present , ” said he , “ but i shall be glad to improve myself ; for in my situation of life -- -- ” mrs. philips was very thankful for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason .
austen	pride	“ but does lydia know nothing of this ? can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand ? ” “ oh , yes ! -- that , that is the worst of all . till i was in kent , and saw so much both of mr. darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam , i was ignorant of the truth myself . and when i returned home the -- -- shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight ’ s time . as that was the case , neither jane , to whom i related the whole , nor i , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to anyone , that the good opinion , which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ? and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs. forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me . that _she_ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head . that such a consequence as _this_ should ensue , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts . ”
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ mr . darcy with him. ” ] chapter liii . [ illustration ] mr. wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet .
austen	pride	it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire , nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay -- oxford , blenheim , warwick , kenilworth , birmingham , etc. , are sufficiently known . a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern . to the little town of lambton , the scene of mrs. gardiner ’ s former residence , and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained , they bent their steps , after having seen all the principal wonders of the country ; and within five miles of lambton , elizabeth found , from her aunt , that pemberley was situated . it was not in their direct road ; nor more than a mile or two out of it . in talking over their route the evening before , mrs. gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again . mr. gardiner declared his willingness , and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation .
austen	pride	miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit , and threw back the praise on her sister ’ s warm affection . “ nay , ” said elizabeth , “ this is not fair . _you_ wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if i speak ill of anybody . _i_ only want to think _you_ perfect , and you set yourself against it . do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will . you need not . there are few people whom i really love , and still fewer of whom i think well . the more i see of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it ; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense . i have met with two instances lately : one i will not mention , the other is charlotte ’ s marriage . it is unaccountable ! in every view it is unaccountable ! ”
austen	pride	when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in tones of such mortifying , yet merited , reproach , her sense of shame was severe . the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial ; and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as having passed at the netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers .
austen	pride	“ it is amazing to me , ” said bingley , “ how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are. ” “ all young ladies accomplished ! my dear charles , what do you mean ? ”
austen	pride	when the ladies returned to the drawing-room , there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted . she inquired into charlotte ’ s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all ; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers , and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry . elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady ’ s attention which could furnish her with an occasion for dictating to others . in the intervals of her discourse with mrs. collins , she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew the least , and who , she observed to mrs. collins , was a very genteel , pretty kind of girl . she asked her at different times how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mother ’ s maiden name ? elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly . lady catherine then observed , --
austen	pride	the housekeeper came ; a respectable looking elderly woman , much less fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her . they followed her into the dining-parlour . it was a large , well-proportioned room , handsomely fitted up . elizabeth , after slightly surveying it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect . the hill , crowned with wood , from which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object . every disposition of the ground was good ; and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight . as they passed into other rooms , these objects were taking different positions ; but from every window there were beauties to be seen . the rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ; but elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine , -- with less of splendour , and more real elegance , than the furniture of rosings .
austen	pride	[ illustration ] chapter xvi . [ illustration ] as no objection was made to the young people ’ s engagement with their aunt , and all mr. collins ’ s scruples of leaving mr. and mrs. bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton ; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing-room , that mr. wickham had accepted their uncle ’ s invitation , and was then in the house .
austen	pride	“ mr . bingley does not know mr. wickham himself. ” “ no ; he never saw him till the other morning at meryton. ” “ this account then is what he has received from mr. darcy . i am perfectly satisfied . but what does he say of the living ? ”
austen	pride	the whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table , and mr. collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs. philips . the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter . it had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; but when mrs. philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her , with much earnest gravity , that it was not of the least importance ; that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy .
austen	pride	with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry . it was not in her nature , however , to increase her vexations by dwelling on them . she was confident of having performed her duty ; and to fret over unavoidable evils , or augment them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition .
austen	pride	“ protested that he never read novels ” 87
austen	pride	“ not perhaps of neglecting his own interest . but of every other neglect i can believe him capable . if , indeed , it should be so ! but i dare not hope it . why should they not go on to scotland , if that had been the case ? ”
austen	pride	“ that is as it happens . it does not necessarily follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours. ” “ lizzy , ” cried her mother , “ remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home . ”
austen	pride	she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico , muslin , and cambric , and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders , had not jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted . one day ’ s delay , she observed , would be of small importance ; and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual . other schemes , too , came into her head .
austen	pride	“ mr . collins , ” said she , “ speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter ; but , from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , i suspect his gratitude misleads him ; and that , in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman . ”
austen	pride	he had been some time with mr. gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river ; and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning . no sooner did he appear , than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ; -- a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room . in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley ’ s , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to mr. darcy were by no means over . miss darcy , on her brother ’ s entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ; and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side . miss bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility , --
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ engaged by the river ” ] chapter xlv . [ illustration ] convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley ’ s dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady ’ s side the acquaintance would now be renewed .
austen	pride	“ unable to utter a syllable ” 457
austen	pride	the farewell between herself and mr. wickham was perfectly friendly ; on his side even more . his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her -- their opinion of everybody -- would always coincide , there was a solicitude , an interest , which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , that , whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing .
austen	pride	“ only this , -- that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me. ” lady catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied , -- “ the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind . from their infancy , they have been intended for each other . it was the favourite wish of _his_ mother , as well as of hers . while in their cradles we planned the union ; and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family ? do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends -- to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh ? are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ? have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? ”
austen	pride	“ it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends. ” “ an easy distance do you call it ? it is nearly fifty miles . ”
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ to make herself agreeable to all ” [ _copyright 1894 by george allen._ ] ] in seeing bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ; and oh ! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner . sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that , as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance . but , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy , who had been set up as a rival to jane . no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard . nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister . on this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of jane , not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared . he observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it “ was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; ” and , before she could reply , he added , “ it is above eight months . we have not met since the 26th of november , when we were all dancing together at netherfield . ”
austen	pride	away ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech . they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room ; from thence to the library ; -- their father was in neither ; and they were on the point of seeking him upstairs with their mother , when they were met by the butler , who said , --
austen	pride	“ such very superior dancing is not often seen ” 118
austen	pride	she followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held . it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine , and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations .
austen	pride	“ could i expect it to be otherwise ? ” said she . “ yet why did he come ? ” she was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself ; and to him she had hardly courage to speak .
austen	pride	“ i did not know before , ” continued bingley , immediately , “ that you were a studier of character . it must be an amusing study. ” “ yes ; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing . they have at least that advantage . ”
austen	pride	“ good gracious ! ” cried mrs. bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , “ if that disagreeable mr. darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley ! what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ? i had no notion but he would go a-shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company . what shall we do with him ? lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in bingley ’ s way . ”
austen	pride	“ miss bingley , ” said he , “ has given me credit for more than can be . the wisest and best of men , -- nay , the wisest and best of their actions , -- may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke . ”
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ hearing herself called ” ] chapter xxxv . [ illustration ] elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes . she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened : it was impossible to think of anything else ; and , totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise . she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of mr. darcy ’ s sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road . the park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground .
austen	pride	“ oh , my dear , ” cried his wife , “ i can not bear to hear that mentioned . pray do not talk of that odious man . i do think it is the hardest thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ; and i am sure , if i had been you , i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it . ”
austen	pride	he was silent . “ tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp , and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley ’ s . ”
austen	pride	“ i daresay you believed it ; but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity . your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man i know ; and if , as you were mounting your horse , a friend were to say , ‘ bingley , you had better stay till next week , ’ you would probably do it -- you would probably not go -- and , at another word , might stay a month . ”
austen	pride	the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton ; a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt , and to a milliner ’ s shop just over the way . the two youngest of the family , catherine and lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions : their minds were more vacant than their sisters ’ , and when nothing better offered , a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ; and , however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt . at present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ; it was to remain the whole winter , and meryton was the head-quarters .
austen	pride	“ i can not see why mrs. forster should not ask _me_ as well as lydia , ” said she , “ though i am _not_ her particular friend . i have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for i am two years older . ”
austen	pride	the morrow produced no abatement of mrs. bennet ’ s ill humour or ill health . mr. collins was also in the same state of angry pride . elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it . he was always to have gone on saturday , and to saturday he still meant to stay .
austen	pride	“ there is a gentleman with him , mamma , ” said kitty ; “ who can it be ? ” “ some acquaintance or other , my dear , i suppose ; i am sure i do not know. ” “ la ! ” replied kitty , “ it looks just like that man that used to be with him before . mr. what ’ s his name -- that tall , proud man . ”
austen	pride	“ and quite alone ? have all her friends left her ? ” “ mrs . annesley is with her . the others have been gone on to scarborough these three weeks. ” she could think of nothing more to say ; but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success . he stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence ; and , at last , on the young lady ’ s whispering to elizabeth again , he walked away .
austen	pride	“ are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this ? ” “ _i_ never saw such a woman . _i_ never saw such capacity , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united . ”
austen	pride	at night she opened her heart to jane . though suspicion was very far from miss bennet ’ s general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here . “ you are joking , lizzy . this can not be ! engaged to mr. darcy ! no , no , you shall not deceive me : i know it to be impossible . ”
austen	pride	“ they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time ; and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible . ”
austen	pride	“ my aunt , ” she continued , “ is going to-morrow into that part of the town , and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street. ” she wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen miss bingley . “ i did not think caroline in spirits , ” were her words , “ but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london . i was right , therefore ; my last letter had never reached her . i inquired after their brother , of course . he was well , but so much engaged with mr. darcy that they scarcely ever saw him . i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner : i wish i could see her . my visit was not long , as caroline and mrs. hurst were going out . i dare say i shall soon see them here . ”
austen	pride	“ i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man ’ s intimates in the regiment , whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself . if there were anyone that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence . at present we have nothing to guide us . colonel forster will , i dare say , do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head . but , on second thoughts , perhaps lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person . ”
austen	pride	colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them : anything was a welcome relief to him at rosings ; and mrs. collins ’ s pretty friend had , moreover , caught his fancy very much . he now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself , as well as of mr. darcy . _his_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her ladyship , after a while , shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out , --
austen	pride	“ this must be a most inconvenient sitting-room for the evening in summer : the windows are full west. ” mrs. bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner ; and then added , --
austen	pride	heading to chapter x . 60
austen	pride	when alone with elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject . “ it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane , ” said she . “ i am sorry it went off . but these things happen so often ! a young man , such as you describe mr. bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and , when accident separates them , so easily forgets her , that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent . ”
austen	pride	“ the gentlemen accompanied him. ” [ _copyright 1894 by george allen._ ] ] the earliest assurance of it ; and , after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park , hurried home with the great intelligence . on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects . there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them , for mr. darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle , lord -- -- ; and , to the great surprise of all the party , when mr. collins returned , the gentlemen accompanied him . charlotte had seen them from her husband ’ s room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , --
austen	pride	as they walked home , elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ; but though jane would have defended either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister .
austen	pride	“ well , monday morning came , and i was in such a fuss ! i was so afraid , you know , that something would happen to put it off , and then i should have gone quite distracted . and there was my aunt , all the time i was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon . however , i did not hear above one word in ten , for i was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear wickham . i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat .
austen	pride	[ illustration ] chapter xxii . [ illustration ] the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases ; and again , during the chief of the day , was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr. collins . elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her . “ it keeps him in good humour , ” said she , “ and i am more obliged to you than i can express . ”
austen	pride	“ i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton ? ” “ yes ; and they have another , who lives somewhere near cheapside. ” “ that is capital , ” added her sister ; and they both laughed heartily .
austen	pride	“ well , mamma , ” said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast-room , “ and what do you think of my husband ? is not he a charming man ? i am sure my sisters must all envy me . i only hope they may have half my good luck . they must all go to brighton . that is the place to get husbands . what a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go ! ”
austen	pride	“ did charlotte dine with you ? ” “ no , she would go home . i fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies . for my part , mr. bingley , _i_ always keep servants that can do their own work ; _my_ daughters are brought up differently . but everybody is to judge for themselves , and the lucases are a very good sort of girls , i assure you . it is a pity they are not handsome ! not that _i_ think charlotte so _very_ plain ; but then she is our particular friend . ”
austen	pride	as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and mrs. bennet , with great politeness and cordiality , said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them .
austen	pride	/ * nind “ my dear friend , * / “ if you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with louisa and me , we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives ; for a whole day ’ s _tête-à-tête_ between two women can never end without a quarrel . come as soon as you can on the receipt of this . my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers . yours ever ,
austen	pride	he paused in hopes of an answer : but his companion was not disposed to make any ; and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing , and called out to her , --
austen	pride	“ her daughter , miss de bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates. ” this information made elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor miss bingley . vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already self-destined to another .
austen	pride	“ if i were as rich as mr. darcy , ” cried a young lucas , who came with his sisters , “ i should not care how proud i was . i would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day . ”
austen	pride	it was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of miss bennet ’ s mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever . kitty simpered and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon . mrs. bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ; and when mr. bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was .
austen	pride	“ i should not be surprised , ” said darcy , “ if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers. ” elizabeth made no answer . she was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him .
austen	pride	[ illustration ] chapter xxxii . [ illustration ] elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to jane , while mrs. collins and maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor . as she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine ; and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter , that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise mr. darcy , and mr. darcy only , entered the room .
austen	pride	“ no , no , nonsense , lizzy . i desire you will stay where you are. ” and upon elizabeth ’ s seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , “ lizzy , i _insist_ upon your staying and hearing mr. collins . ”
austen	pride	they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother . mrs. bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure jane would have caught cold again . but their father , though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure , was really glad to see them ; he had felt their importance in the family circle . the evening conversation , when they were all assembled , had lost much of its animation , and almost all its sense , by the absence of jane and elizabeth .
austen	pride	“ i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression . i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way. ” “ i can easily believe it . you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , i am sure you did . the turn of your countenance i shall never forget , as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me . ”
austen	pride	“ indeed , mr. bennet , ” said she , “ it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that _i_ should be forced to make way for _her_ , and live to see her take my place in it ! ”
austen	pride	“ i am quite sorry , lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself ; but i hope you will not mind it . it is all for jane ’ s sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then ; so do not put yourself to inconvenience . ”
austen	pride	“ and what is your success ? ” she shook her head . “ i do not get on at all . i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly. ” “ i can readily believe , ” answered he , gravely , “ that reports may vary greatly with respect to me ; and i could wish , miss bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either . ”
austen	pride	“ your attendance upon her has been too much for you . you do not look well . oh that i had been with you ! you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone . ”
austen	pride	the introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions . that he was _surprised_ by the connection was evident : he sustained it , however , with fortitude : and , so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with mr. gardiner . elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph . it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush . she listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners .
austen	pride	“ protested he must be entirely mistaken ” 161
austen	pride	“ pardon me for interrupting you , madam , ” cried mr. collins ; “ but if she is really headstrong and foolish , i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state . if , therefore , she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because , if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . ”
austen	pride	“ oh , mary , ” said she , “ i wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun ! as we went along kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and i should have gone so all the way , if kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the george , i do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too . and then when we came away it was such fun ! i thought we never should have got into the coach . i was ready to die of laughter . and then we were so merry all the way home ! we talked and laughed so loud , that anybody might have heard us ten miles off ! ”
austen	pride	“ how nicely we are crammed in ! ” cried lydia . “ i am glad i brought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another band-box ! well , now let us be quite comfortable and snug , and talk and laugh all the way home . and in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away . have you seen any pleasant men ? have you had any flirting ? i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back . jane will be quite an old maid soon , i declare . she is almost three-and-twenty ! lord ! how ashamed i should be of not being married before three-and-twenty ! my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands you can ’ t think . she says lizzy had better have taken mr. collins ; but _i_ do not think there would have been any fun in it . lord ! how i should like to be married before any of you ! and then i would _chaperon_ you about to all the balls . dear me ! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forster ’ s ! kitty and me were to spend the day there , and mrs. forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; ( by-the-bye , mrs. forster and me are _such_ friends ! ) and so she asked the two harringtons to come : but harriet was ill , and so pen was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ? we dressed up chamberlayne in woman ’ s clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady , -- only think what fun ! not a soul knew of it , but colonel and mrs. forster , and kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ; and you can not imagine how well he looked ! when denny , and wickham , and pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least . lord ! how i laughed ! and so did mrs. forster . i thought i should have died . and _that_ made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter . ”
austen	pride	“ and is this all ? ” cried elizabeth . “ i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden , and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter ! ” “ la ! my dear , ” said maria , quite shocked at the mistake , “ it is not lady catherine . the old lady is mrs. jenkinson , who lives with them . the other is miss de bourgh . only look at her . she is quite a little creature . who would have thought she could be so thin and small ! ”
austen	pride	on mr. and mrs. gardiner ’ s coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ; but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness . mr. darcy handed the ladies into the carriage ; and when it drove off , elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house .
austen	pride	“ as much as i ever wish to be , ” cried elizabeth , warmly . “ i have spent four days in the same house with him , and i think him very disagreeable. ” “ i have no right to give _my_ opinion , ” said wickham , “ as to his being agreeable or otherwise . i am not qualified to form one . i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge . it is impossible for _me_ to be impartial . but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish -- and , perhaps , you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else . here you are in your own family . ”
austen	pride	lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth ’ s performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste . elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship ’ s carriage was ready to take them all home .
austen	pride	[ illustration ] chapter xxi . [ illustration ] the discussion of mr. collins ’ s offer was now nearly at an end , and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother . as for the gentleman himself , _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence . he scarcely ever spoke to her ; and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas , whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend .
austen	pride	after wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought , reconsidering events , determining probabilities , and reconciling herself , as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home ; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation .
austen	pride	the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching ; and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from mrs. gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent . mr. gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july , and must be in london again within a month ; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the lakes , and substitute a more contracted tour ; and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward than derbyshire . in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks ; and to mrs. gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction . the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock , chatsworth , dovedale , or the peak .
austen	pride	to mrs. gardiner , wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers . about ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged . they had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ; and , though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy ’ s father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring .
austen	pride	“ no more have i , ” said mr. bennet ; “ and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you. ” mrs. bennet deigned not to make any reply ; but , unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters .
austen	pride	mr. collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter . lady catherine observed , after dinner , that miss bennet seemed out of spirits ; and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added , --
austen	pride	mr. darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , “ _you_ can not have a right to such very strong local attachment . _you_ can not have been always at longbourn. ” elizabeth looked surprised . the gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a colder voice , --
austen	pride	“ delighted to see their dear friend again ” 108
austen	pride	she was shown into the breakfast parlour , where all but jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise . that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to mrs. hurst and miss bingley ; and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it . she was received , however , very politely by them ; and in their brother ’ s manners there was something better than politeness -- there was good-humour and kindness . mr. darcy said very little , and mr. hurst nothing at all . the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasion ’ s justifying her coming so far alone . the latter was thinking only of his breakfast .
austen	pride	“ a note for miss bennet ” 36
austen	pride	“ true . are the others coming out ? ” “ i do not know . mrs. bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton . and so , my dear sister , i find , from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen pemberley . ”
austen	pride	“ for my own part , ” she rejoined , “ i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her . her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome . her nose wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines . her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , i never could perceive anything extraordinary in them . they have a sharp , shrewish look , which i do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self-sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable . ”
austen	pride	“ _her_ not objecting does not justify _him_ . it only shows her being deficient in something herself -- sense or feeling. ” “ well , ” cried elizabeth , “ have it as you choose . _he_ shall be mercenary , and _she_ shall be foolish . ”
austen	pride	mr. bennet treated the matter differently . “ so , lizzy , ” said he , one day , “ your sister is crossed in love , i find . i congratulate her . next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then . it is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions . when is your turn to come ? you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane . now is your time . here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country . let wickham be your man . he is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably . ”
austen	pride	when breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters ; and elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for jane . the apothecary came ; and having examined his patient , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ; advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts . the advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head ached acutely . elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent ; the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere .
austen	pride	[ _copyright 1894 by george allen._ ] ] chapter lx . [ illustration ] elizabeth ’ s spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted mr. darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her . “ how could you begin ? ” said she . “ i can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ? ”
austen	pride	in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion , with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode , and the improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them ; and he found in mrs. philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could . to the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantel-piece , the interval of waiting appeared very long . it was over at last , however . the gentlemen did approach : and when mr. wickham walked into the room , elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration . the officers of the -- -- shire were in general a very creditable , gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party ; but mr , wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and walk , as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle philips , breathing port wine , who followed them into the room .
austen	pride	her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or soothe her would only increase the irritation . she talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr. collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , --
austen	pride	at length there was nothing more to be said ; the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house . mr. collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day .
austen	pride	wickham ’ s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of accents , --
austen	pride	as he quitted the room , elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire ; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination .
austen	pride	“ you judge very properly , ” said mr. bennet ; “ and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy . may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ? ”
austen	pride	“ it _is_ wonderful , ” replied wickham ; “ for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ; and pride has often been his best friend . it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling . but we are none of us consistent ; and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride . ”
austen	pride	“ you mean to frighten me , mr. darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me . but i will not be alarmed , though your sister _does_ play so well . there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others . my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me . ”
austen	pride	mr. bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike : he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners . his sisters were fine women , with an air of decided fashion . his brother-in-law , mr. hurst , merely looked the gentleman ; but his friend mr. darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble mien , and the report , which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year . the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr. bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend .
austen	pride	“ this is the consequence , you see , madam , of marrying a daughter , ” said elizabeth . “ it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single. ” “ it is no such thing . lydia does not leave me because she is married ; but only because her husband ’ s regiment happens to be so far off . if that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon . ”
austen	pride	it was a journey of only twenty-four miles , and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch street by noon . as they drove to mr. gardiner ’ s door , jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival : when they entered the passage , she was there to welcome them , and elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever . on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousin ’ s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower . all was joy and kindness . the day passed most pleasantly away ; the morning in bustle and shopping , and the evening at one of the theatres .
austen	pride	“ why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear. ” / * right “ hunsford , near westerham , kent , _15th october_ . * / “ dear sir , “ the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness ; and , since i have had the misfortune to lose him , i have frequently wished to heal the breach : but , for some time , i was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance. ” -- ‘ there , mrs. bennet. ’ -- “ my mind , however , is now made up on the subject ; for , having received ordination at easter , i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh , widow of sir lewis de bourgh , whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england . as a clergyman , moreover , i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch . i can not be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologize for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends ; but of this hereafter . if you should have no objection to receive me into your house , i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , monday , november 18th , by four o ’ clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se ’ nnight following , which i can do without any inconvenience , as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day . i remain , dear sir , with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters , your well-wisher and friend ,
austen	pride	“ nothing , child , nothing . i did not wink at you. ” she then sat still five minutes longer ; but unable to waste such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to kitty , --
austen	pride	elizabeth felt herself completely taken in . she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances ; and to have mr. collins instead ! -- her liveliness had been never worse timed . there was no help for it , however . mr. wickham ’ s happiness and her own was perforce delayed a little longer , and mr. collins ’ s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could . she was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more . it now first struck her , that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors . the idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities towards herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _her_ . elizabeth , however , did not choose to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply . mr. collins might never make the offer , and , till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him .
austen	pride	“ good gracious ! mr . darcy ! -- and so it does , i vow . well , any friend of mr. bingley ’ s will always be welcome here , to be sure ; but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him . ”
austen	pride	“ i do not believe a word of it , my dear . if he had been so very agreeable , he would have talked to mrs. long . but i can guess how it was ; everybody says that he is eat up with pride , and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs. long does not keep a carriage , and had to come to the ball in a hack chaise . ”
austen	pride	from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink . the wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this . she was humbled , she was grieved ; she repented , though she hardly knew of what . she became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it . she wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence . she was convinced that she could have been happy with him , when it was no longer likely they should meet .
austen	pride	when at length they arose to take leave , mrs. bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to mr. bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation . bingley was all grateful pleasure ; and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from london , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time .
austen	pride	elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her . “ but it is not merely this affair , ” she continued , “ on which my dislike is founded . long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided . your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr. wickham . on this subject , what can you have to say ? in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ? or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others ? ”
austen	pride	he looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ; but , with a moment ’ s recollection , and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ; and , after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man , asked her how she had liked him . her answer was warmly in his favour . with an air of indifference , he soon afterwards added , “ how long did you say that he was at rosings ? ”
austen	pride	“ mr . darcy is not to be laughed at ! ” cried elizabeth . “ that is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon i hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance . i dearly love a laugh . ”
austen	pride	he began to wish to know more of her ; and , as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others . his doing so drew her notice . it was at sir william lucas ’ s , where a large party were assembled .
austen	pride	heading to preface ix
austen	pride	her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital . after a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display .
austen	pride	catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ; but lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of captain carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to london .
austen	pride	they were within twenty yards of each other ; and so abrupt was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight . their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush . he absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility .
austen	pride	/ * “ my dear sir , * / “ i feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire . be assured , my dear sir , that mrs. collins and myself sincerely sympathize with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove . no arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can alleviate so severe a misfortune ; or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be , of all others , most afflicting to a parent ’ s mind . the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this . and it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your
austen	pride	she saw him start at this ; but he said nothing , and she continued , -- “ you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . ”
austen	pride	“ but i can assure you , ” she added , “ that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _his_ fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing . so high and so conceited , that there was no enduring him ! he walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great ! not handsome enough to dance with ! i wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set-downs . i quite detest the man . ”
austen	pride	“ you look conscious . young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but i think i may defy even _your_ sagacity to discover the name of your admirer . this letter is from mr. collins . ”
austen	pride	“ has she been presented ? i do not remember her name among the ladies at court. ” “ her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town ; and by that means , as i told lady catherine myself one day , has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament . her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea ; and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies . i have more than once observed to lady catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess ; and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her . these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay . ”
austen	pride	“ i wish i could say anything to comfort you , ” replied elizabeth ; “ but it is wholly out of my power . you must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much . ”
austen	pride	she was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence ; mr. darcy , only for a few minutes , to take leave , but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found . elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him ; she really rejoiced at it . colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object . she could think only of her letter .
austen	pride	“ not as you represent it . had she merely _dined_ with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together -- and four evenings may do a great deal . ”
austen	pride	“ what do you mean , hill ? we have heard nothing from town. ” “ dear madam , ” cried mrs. hill , in great astonishment , “ don ’ t you know there is an express come for master from mr. gardiner ? he has been here this half hour , and master has had a letter . ”
austen	pride	“ my mother would have no objection , but my father hates london. ” “ has your governess left you ? ” “ we never had any governess. ” “ no governess ! how was that possible ? five daughters brought up at home without a governess ! i never heard of such a thing . your mother must have been quite a slave to your education . ”
austen	pride	“ yes , she called yesterday with her father . what an agreeable man sir william is , mr. bingley -- is not he ? so much the man of fashion ! so genteel and so easy ! he has always something to say to everybody . _that_ is my idea of good breeding ; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter . ”
austen	pride	consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband ’ s incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr. bingley , in consequence of it , before _they_ did . as the day of his arrival drew near , --
austen	pride	she then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham . what a stroke was this for poor jane , who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual ! nor was darcy ’ s vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery . most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other .
austen	pride	“ they entered the breakfast-room ” 143
austen	pride	“ and till colonel forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , i suppose , of their being really married ? ” “ how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains ? i felt a little uneasy -- a little fearful of my sister ’ s happiness with him in marriage , because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right . my father and mother knew nothing of that ; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be . kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in lydia ’ s last letter she had prepared her for such a step . she had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other many weeks . ”
austen	pride	“ except , ” thought elizabeth , “ when she goes to ramsgate. ” “ if your master would marry , you might see more of him. ” “ yes , sir ; but i do not know when _that_ will be . i do not know who is good enough for him . ”
austen	pride	elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and mr. bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem .
austen	pride	“ care of him ! yes , i really believe darcy _does_ take care of him in those points where he most wants care . from something that he told me in our journey hither , i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him . but i ought to beg his pardon , for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant . it was all conjecture . ”
austen	pride	kitty , who took all these threats in a serious light , began to cry . “ well , well , ” said he , “ do not make yourself unhappy . if you are a good girl for the next ten years , i will take you to a review at the end of them . ”
austen	pride	when the tea things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose ; and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a victim to her mother ’ s rapacity for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party . she now lost every expectation of pleasure . they were confined for the evening at different tables ; and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself .
austen	pride	then taking the disengaged arm of mr. darcy , she left elizabeth to walk by herself . the path just admitted three . mr. darcy felt their rudeness , and immediately said , -- “ this walk is not wide enough for our party . we had better go into the avenue . ”
austen	pride	“ my fingers , ” said elizabeth , “ do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women ’ s do . they have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression . but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault -- because i would not take the trouble of practising . it is not that i do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other woman ’ s of superior execution . ”
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ when colonel miller ’ s regiment went away ” [ _copyright 1894 by george allen._ ] ] chapter xli . [ illustration ] the first week of their return was soon gone . the second began . it was the last of the regiment ’ s stay in meryton , and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace . the dejection was almost universal . the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments . very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family .
austen	pride	the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brother ’ s in sending it . four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister .
austen	pride	“ i hope mr. bingley will like it ” 6
austen	pride	“ ten thousand pounds ! heaven forbid ! how is half such a sum to be repaid ? ” mr. bennet made no answer ; and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house . their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast-room .
austen	pride	“ i have been most highly gratified , indeed , my dear sir ; such very superior dancing is not often seen . it is evident that you belong to the first circles . allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you : and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear miss eliza ( glancing at her sister and bingley ) , shall take place . what congratulations will then flow in ! i appeal to mr. darcy ; -- but let me not interrupt you , sir . you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me . ”
austen	pride	before elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise , mrs. bennet instantly answered , -- “ oh dear ! yes , certainly . i am sure lizzy will be very happy -- i am sure she can have no objection . come , kitty , i want you upstairs. ” and gathering her work together , she was hastening away , when elizabeth called out , --
austen	pride	“ my love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ? ” said her aunt . “ a place , too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected . wickham passed all his youth there , you know . ”
austen	pride	“ i see your design , bingley , ” said his friend . “ you dislike an argument , and want to silence this. ” “ perhaps i do . arguments are too much like disputes . if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room , i shall be very thankful ; and then you may say whatever you like of me . ”
austen	pride	he listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner ; and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit flowed along .
austen	pride	“ mr . darcy ! ” repeated elizabeth , in utter amazement . “ oh , yes ! he was to come there with wickham , you know . but , gracious me ! i quite forgot ! i ought not to have said a word about it . i promised them so faithfully ! what will wickham say ? it was to be such a secret ! ”
austen	pride	“ it will be no use to us , if twenty such should come , since you will not visit them. ” “ depend upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , i will visit them all . ”
austen	pride	“ i am not likely to leave kent for some time . promise me , therefore , to come to hunsford. ” elizabeth could not refuse , though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit . “ my father and maria are to come to me in march , ” added charlotte , “ and i hope you will consent to be of the party . indeed , eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them . ”
austen	pride	“ i believe her to be both in a great degree , ” replied wickham ; “ i have not seen her for many years ; but i very well remember that i never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent . she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class . ”
austen	pride	“ there is also one other person in the party , ” he continued after a pause , “ who more particularly wishes to be known to you . will you allow me , or do i ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton ? ”
austen	pride	by mrs. hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a courtesy ; and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments . it was first broken by mrs. annesley , a genteel , agreeable-looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the others ; and between her and mrs. gardiner , with occasional help from elizabeth , the conversation was carried on . miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard .
austen	pride	“ i am perfectly ready , i assure you , to keep my engagement ; and , when your sister is recovered , you shall , if you please , name the very day of the ball . but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill ? ”
austen	pride	with no expectation of pleasure , but with the strongest curiosity , elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand . the envelope itself was likewise full . pursuing her way along the lane , she then began it . it was dated from rosings , at eight o ’ clock in the morning , and was as follows : --
austen	pride	jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , panting for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out , --
austen	pride	“ lady catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use . but tell me , what did you come down to netherfield for ? was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed ? or had you intended any more serious consequences ? ”
austen	pride	“ indeed , you are mistaken . i have no such injuries to resent . it is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which i am now complaining . our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia ’ s character . excuse me , -- for i must speak plainly . if you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment . her character will be fixed ; and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous ; -- a flirt , too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and , from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite . in this danger kitty is also comprehended . she will follow wherever lydia leads . vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrolled ! oh , my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ? ”
austen	pride	elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness . she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ; and the pleasure of being with charlotte , and the kind attention she had received , must make _her_ feel the obliged . mr. collins was gratified ; and with a more smiling solemnity replied , --
austen	pride	“ from mr. collins ! and what can _he_ have to say ? ” “ something very much to the purpose , of course . he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which , it seems , he has been told by some of the good-natured , gossiping lucases . i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point . what relates to yourself is as follows : -- ‘ having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs. collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another , of which we have been advertised by the same authority . your daughter elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of bennet , after her eldest sister has resigned it ; and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land. ’ can you possibly guess , lizzy , who is meant by this ? ‘ this young gentleman is blessed , in a peculiar way , with everything the heart of mortal can most desire , -- splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage . yet , in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman ’ s proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of. ’ have you any idea , lizzy , who this gentleman is ? but now it comes out . ‘ my motive for cautioning you is as follows : -- we have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady catherine de bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye. ’ _mr . darcy_ , you see , is the man ! now , lizzy , i think i _have_ surprised you . could he , or the lucases , have pitched on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ? mr. darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at _you_ in his life ! it is admirable ! ”
austen	pride	while thus engaged , elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr. darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came .
austen	pride	“ if we thought alike of miss bingley , ” replied jane , “ your representation of all this might make me quite easy . but i know the foundation is unjust . caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone ; and all that i can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself . ”
austen	pride	during their walk , it was resolved that mr. bennet ’ s consent should be asked in the course of the evening : elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother ’ s . she could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man ; but whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that mr. darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation .
austen	pride	“ oh ! hang kitty ! what has she to do with it ? come , be quick , be quick ! where is your sash , my dear ? ” but when her mother was gone , jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters .
austen	pride	her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr. gardiner ’ s behaviour laid them all under . “ for we must attribute this happy conclusion , ” she added , “ in a great measure to his kindness . we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr. wickham with money . ”
austen	pride	though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it ; for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that _one_ only of the household , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject .
austen	pride	“ you may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire , my dear cousin . i flatter myself , at least , that you will be able to do so . lady catherine ’ s great attentions to mrs. collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate -- but on this point it will be as well to be silent . only let me assure you , my dear miss elizabeth , that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage . my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking . there is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us . we seem to have been designed for each other . ”
austen	pride	“ _you_ observed it , mr. darcy , i am sure , ” said miss bingley ; “ and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such an exhibition . ”
austen	pride	“ much more rational , my dear caroline , i dare say ; but it would not be near so much like a ball. ” miss bingley made no answer , and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room . her figure was elegant , and she walked well ; but darcy , at whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious . in the desperation of her feelings , she resolved on one effort more ; and , turning to elizabeth , said , --
austen	pride	mrs. philips was always glad to see her nieces ; and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome ; and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not fetched them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see mr. jones ’ s shopboy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield , because the miss bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards mr. collins by jane ’ s introduction of him . she received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologizing for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself , however , might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice . mrs. philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that mr. denny had brought him from london , and that he was to have a lieutenant ’ s commission in the -- -- shire . she had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street , -- and had mr. wickham appeared , kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation ; but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who , in comparison with the stranger , were become “ stupid , disagreeable fellows. ” some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr. wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from longbourn would come in the evening . this was agreed to ; and mrs. philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards . the prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits . mr. collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured , with unwearying civility , that they were perfectly needless .
austen	pride	the good news quickly spread through the house ; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood . it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy . to be sure , it would have been more for the advantage of conversation , had miss lydia bennet come upon the town ; or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world in some distant farm-house . but there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing , which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such a husband her misery was considered certain .
austen	pride	“ i have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future . he has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing . ”
austen	pride	“ upon my word i say no more _here_ than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except netherfield . he is not at all liked in hertfordshire . everybody is disgusted with his pride . you will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone . ”
austen	pride	“ my eldest sister has been in town these three months . have you never happened to see her there ? ” she was perfectly sensible that he never had : but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane ; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet . the subject was pursued no further , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away .
austen	pride	elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy . she had been unwilling to mention bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend : but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydia ’ s marriage . all was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation .
austen	pride	“ as often as i can . but you know married women have never much time for writing . my sisters may write to _me_ . they will have nothing else to do. ” mr. wickham ’ s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife ’ s . he smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things .
austen	pride	“ i am sorry , exceedingly sorry , ” replied darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , “ that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness . i did not think mrs. gardiner was so little to be trusted . ”

austen	pride	“ but my father can not . he wrote last week to hurry my return. ” [ illustration : “ dawson ” [ _copyright 1894 by george allen._ ] ] “ oh , your father , of course , may spare you , if your mother can . daughters are never of so much consequence to a father . and if you will stay another _month_ complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london , for i am going there early in june , for a week ; and as dawson does not object to the barouche-box , there will be very good room for one of you -- and , indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , i should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large . ”
austen	pride	_in the first place , the book ( it may be barely necessary to remind the reader ) was in its first shape written very early , somewhere about 1796 , when miss austen was barely twenty-one ; though it was revised and finished at chawton some fifteen years later , and was not published till 1813 , only four years before her death . i do not know whether , in this combination of the fresh and vigorous projection of youth , and the critical revision of middle life , there may be traced the distinct superiority in point of construction , which , as it seems to me , it possesses over all the others . the plot , though not elaborate , is almost regular enough for fielding ; hardly a character , hardly an incident could be retrenched without loss to the story . the elopement of lydia and wickham is not , like that of crawford and mrs. rushworth , a_ coup de théâtre ; _it connects itself in the strictest way with the course of the story earlier , and brings about the denouement with complete propriety . all the minor passages -- the loves of jane and bingley , the advent of mr. collins , the visit to hunsford , the derbyshire tour -- fit in after the same unostentatious , but masterly fashion . there is no attempt at the hide-and-seek , in-and-out business , which in the transactions between frank churchill and jane fairfax contributes no doubt a good deal to the intrigue of_ emma , _but contributes it in a fashion which i do not think the best feature of that otherwise admirable book . although miss austen always liked something of the misunderstanding kind , which afforded her opportunities for the display of the peculiar and incomparable talent to be noticed presently , she has been satisfied here with the perfectly natural occasions provided by the false account of darcy ’ s conduct given by wickham , and by the awkwardness ( arising with equal naturalness ) from the gradual transformation of elizabeth ’ s own feelings from positive aversion to actual love . i do not know whether the all-grasping hand of the playwright has ever been laid upon_ pride and prejudice ; _and i dare say that , if it were , the situations would prove not startling or garish enough for the footlights , the character-scheme too subtle and delicate for pit and gallery . but if the attempt were made , it would certainly not be hampered by any of those loosenesses of construction , which , sometimes disguised by the conveniences of which the novelist can avail himself , appear at once on the stage._
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ i have not an instant to lose ” ] concern , and observe her in compassionate silence . at length she spoke again . “ i have just had a letter from jane , with such dreadful news . it can not be concealed from anyone . my youngest sister has left all her friends -- has eloped ; has thrown herself into the power of -- of mr. wickham . they are gone off together from brighton . _you_ know him too well to doubt the rest . she has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to -- she is lost for ever . ”
austen	pride	miss bennet accepted her aunt ’ s invitation with pleasure ; and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she hoped , by caroline ’ s not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him .
austen	pride	had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility . in lydia ’ s imagination , a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness . she saw , with the creative eye of fancy , the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers . she saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at present unknown . she saw all the glories of the camp : its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines , crowded with the young and the gay , and dazzling with scarlet ; and , to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a tent , tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once .
austen	pride	“ it may do very well for the others , ” replied mr. bingley ; “ but i am sure it will be too much for kitty . won ’ t it , kitty ? ” kitty owned that she had rather stay at home . darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount , and elizabeth silently consented . as she went upstairs to get ready , mrs. bennet followed her , saying , --
austen	pride	“ two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge . the first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , i had detached mr. bingley from your sister , -- and the other , that i had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr. wickham . wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison . but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , i shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read . if , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours , i can only say that i am sorry . the necessity must be obeyed , and further apology would be absurd . i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw , in common with others , that bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country . but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment . i had often seen him in love before . at that ball , while i had the honour of dancing with you , i was first made acquainted , by sir william lucas ’ s accidental information , that bingley ’ s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage . he spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be undecided . from that moment i observed my friend ’ s behaviour attentively ; and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him . your sister i also watched . her look and manners were open , cheerful , and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard ; and i remained convinced , from the evening ’ s scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment . if _you_ have not been mistaken here , _i_ must have been in an error . your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable . if it be so , if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable . but i shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister ’ s countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched . that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain ; but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears . i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it ; i believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as i wished it in reason . my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me . but there were other causes of repugnance ; causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , i had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me . these causes must be stated , though briefly . the situation of your mother ’ s family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father : -- pardon me , -- it pains me to offend you . but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both . i will only say , farther , that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection . he left netherfield for london on the day following , as you , i am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning . the part which i acted is now to be explained . his sisters ’ uneasiness had been equally excited with my own : our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered ; and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london . we accordingly went -- and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice . i described and enforced them earnestly . but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance , which i hesitated not in giving , of your sister ’ s indifference . he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal , regard . but bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own . to convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point . to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment . i can not blame myself for having done thus much . there is but one part of my conduct , in the whole affair , on which i do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister ’ s being in town . i knew it myself , as it was known to miss bingley ; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it . that they might have met without ill consequence is , perhaps , probable ; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger . perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me . it is done , however , and it was done for the best . on this subject i have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer . if i have wounded your sister ’ s feelings , it was unknowingly done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , i have not yet learnt to condemn them. -- with respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured mr. wickham , i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family . of what he has _particularly_ accused me i am ignorant ; but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity . mr. wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates , and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him ; and on george wickham , who was his godson , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed . my father supported him at school , and afterwards at cambridge ; most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman ’ s education . my father was not only fond of this young man ’ s society , whose manners were always engaging , he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it . as for myself , it is many , many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner . the vicious propensities , the want of principle , which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which mr. darcy could not have . here again i shall give you pain -- to what degree you only can tell . but whatever may be the sentiments which mr. wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character . it adds even another motive . my excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to mr. wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant . there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds . his own father did not long survive mine ; and within half a year from these events mr. wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited . he had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein . i rather wished than believed him to be sincere ; but , at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal . i knew that mr. wickham ought not to be a clergyman . the business was therefore soon settled . he resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds . all connection between us seemed now dissolved . i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley , or admit his society in town . in town , i believe , he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence ; and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation . for about three years i heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation . his circumstances , he assured me , and i had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad . he had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if i would present him to the living in question -- of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for , and i could not have forgotten my revered father ’ s intentions . you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it . his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances -- and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself . after this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropped . how he lived , i know not . but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice . i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being . having said thus much , i feel no doubt of your secrecy . my sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother ’ s nephew , colonel fitzwilliam , and myself . about a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in london ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate ; and thither also went mr. wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs. younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement . she was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , i am happy to add , that i owed the knowledge of it to herself . i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement ; and then georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me . you may imagine what i felt and how i acted . regard for my sister ’ s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure ; but i wrote to mr. wickham , who left the place immediately , and mrs. younge was of course removed from her charge . mr. wickham ’ s chief object was unquestionably my sister ’ s fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but i can not help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement . his revenge would have been complete indeed . this , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , i hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr. wickham . i know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood , he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at , ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either . detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination . you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night . but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed . for the truth of everything here related , i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam , who , from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father ’ s will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions . if your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless , you can not be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning . i will only add , god bless you .
austen	pride	mrs. hurst sang with her sister ; and while they were thus employed , elizabeth could not help observing , as she turned over some music-books that lay on the instrument , how frequently mr. darcy ’ s eyes were fixed on her . she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man , and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange . she could only imagine , however , at last , that she drew his notice because there was something about her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present . the supposition did not pain her . she liked him too little to care for his approbation .
austen	pride	“ let me first see how he behaves , ” said she ; “ it will then be early enough for expectation. ” she sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door . jane looked a little paler than usual , but more sedate than elizabeth had expected . on the gentlemen ’ s appearing , her colour increased ; yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance .
austen	pride	as she pronounced these words , mr. darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued , -- “ i have every reason in the world to think ill of you . no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_ . you dare not , you can not deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind . ”
austen	pride	nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance . his sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards mr. darcy with a very expressive smile . elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother ’ s thoughts , now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since _her_ coming away .
austen	pride	“ i would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as i ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory detail of particulars ; but , to say the truth , i was too cross to write . you supposed more than really existed . but _now_ suppose as much as you choose ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you can not greatly err . you must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last . i thank you again and again , for not going to the lakes . how could i be so silly as to wish it ! your idea of the ponies is delightful . we will go round the park every day . i am the happiest creature in the world . perhaps other people have said so before , but no one with such justice . i am happier even than jane ; she only smiles , i laugh . mr. darcy sends you all the love in the world that can be spared from me . you are all to come to pemberley at christmas . yours , ” etc .
austen	pride	elizabeth was forced to give in to a little falsehood here ; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible . [ illustration : “ but now it comes out ” ] chapter lvii .
austen	pride	“ he is certainly a good brother , ” said elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows . mrs. reynolds anticipated miss darcy ’ s delight , when she should enter the room . “ and this is always the way with him , ” she added . “ whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment . there is nothing he would not do for her . ”
austen	pride	“ really , mr. collins , ” cried elizabeth , with some warmth , “ you puzzle me exceedingly . if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one . ”
austen	pride	[ illustration ] chapter lvi . [ illustration ] one morning , about a week after bingley ’ s engagement with jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage ; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn . it was too early in the morning for visitors ; and besides , the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours . the horses were post ; and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who preceded it , were familiar to them . as it was certain , however , that somebody was coming , bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the shrubbery . they both set off ; and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered . it was lady catherine de bourgh .
austen	pride	they descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ; and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned . she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken . on applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall ; and elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was .
austen	pride	the conversation soon turned upon fishing ; and she heard mr. darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport . mrs. gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder . elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself . her astonishment , however , was extreme ; and continually was she repeating , “ why is he so altered ? from what can it proceed ? it can not be for _me_ , it can not be for _my_ sake that his manners are thus softened . my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this . it is impossible that he should still love me . ”
austen	pride	in spite of her deeply-rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man ’ s affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost all compassion in anger . she tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done . he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand . as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer . he _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security . such a circumstance could only exasperate farther ; and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said , --
austen	pride	“ i advise mr. darcy , and lizzy , and kitty , ” said mrs. bennet , “ to walk to oakham mount this morning . it is a nice long walk , and mr. darcy has never seen the view . ”
austen	pride	“ in such cases as this , it is , i believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned . it is natural that obligation should be felt , and if i could _feel_ gratitude , i would now thank you . but i can not -- i have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly . i am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone . it has been most unconsciously done , however , and i hope will be of short duration . the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation . ”
austen	pride	“ how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter ! ” he made no answer . “ you write uncommonly fast. ” “ you are mistaken . i write rather slowly. ” “ how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year ! letters of business , too ! how odious i should think them ! ”
austen	pride	“ by all means , ” cried bingley ; “ let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size , for that will have more weight in the argument , miss bennet , than you may be aware of . i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , i should not pay him half so much deference . i declare i do not know a more awful object than darcy on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a sunday evening , when he has nothing to do . ”
austen	pride	“ well , ” said charlotte , “ i wish jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to-morrow , i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth . happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance . if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar beforehand , it does not advance their felicity in the least . they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life . ”
austen	pride	mr. collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family . mr. bennet indeed said little ; but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and mr. collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself . he was a tall , heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty . his air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal . he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs. bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , fame had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage . this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers ; but mrs. bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments , answered most readily , --
austen	pride	their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ; and within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached mr. gardiner ’ s house , where they were to remain a few days .
austen	pride	he then went away , and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself . mrs. gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both . the looks and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention . they talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit , of everything but himself ; yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs. gardiner thought of him , and mrs. gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece ’ s beginning the subject .
austen	pride	mrs. gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham ’ s desertion , and complimented her on bearing it so well . “ but , my dear elizabeth , ” she added , “ what sort of girl is miss king ? i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary . ”
austen	pride	from the entrance hall , of which mr. collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an antechamber to the room where lady catherine , her daughter , and mrs. jenkinson were sitting . her ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them ; and as mrs. collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary .
austen	pride	“ to whom i have related the affair ” 363
austen	pride	he then asked her to walk into the house -- but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn . at such a time much might have been said , and silence was very awkward . she wanted to talk , but there seemed an embargo on every subject . at last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of matlock and dovedale with great perseverance . yet time and her aunt moved slowly -- and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the _tête-à-tête_ was over .
austen	pride	[ illustration ] chapter xl . [ illustration ] elizabeth ’ s impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr. darcy and herself .
austen	pride	_and , after all , what is the good of seeking for the reason of charm ? -- it is there . there were better sense in the sad mechanic exercise of determining the reason of its absence where it is not . in the novels of the last hundred years there are vast numbers of young ladies with whom it might be a pleasure to fall in love ; there are at least five with whom , as it seems to me , no man of taste and spirit can help doing so . their names are , in chronological order , elizabeth bennet , diana vernon , argemone lavington , beatrix esmond , and barbara grant . i should have been most in love with beatrix and argemone ; i should , i think , for mere occasional companionship , have preferred diana and barbara . but to live with and to marry , i do not know that any one of the four can come into competition with elizabeth._
austen	pride	[ illustration : ‘ lady catherine , said she , you have given me a treasure. ’ [ _copyright 1894 by george allen._ ] ] chapter xxix . [ illustration ] mr. collins ’ s triumph , in consequence of this invitation , was complete . the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for ; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady catherine ’ s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough .
austen	pride	after walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park . the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees . she was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park : he was moving that way ; and fearful of its being mr. darcy , she was directly retreating . but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her , and stepping forward with eagerness , pronounced her name . she had turned away ; but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be mr. darcy , she moved again towards the gate . he had by that time reached it also ; and , holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said , with a look of haughty composure , “ i have been walking in the grove some time , in the hope of meeting you . will you do me the honour of reading that letter ? ” and then , with a slight bow , turned again into the plantation , and was soon out of sight .
austen	pride	“ it certainly is a most iniquitous affair , ” said mr. bennet ; “ and nothing can clear mr. collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn . but if you will listen to his letter , you may , perhaps , be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself . ”
austen	pride	his arrival was soon known at the parsonage ; for mr. collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane , in order to have [ illustration :
austen	pride	they were all astonished ; and mr. bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said , -- “ but is there not danger of lady catherine ’ s disapprobation here , my good sir ? you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness . ”
austen	pride	elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book ; and , soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card-table , and stationed herself between mr. bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game .
austen	pride	_the characteristics of miss austen ’ s humour are so subtle and delicate that they are , perhaps , at all times easier to apprehend than to express , and at any particular time likely to be differently apprehended by different persons . to me this humour seems to possess a greater affinity , on the whole , to that of addison than to any other of the numerous species of this great british genus . the differences of scheme , of time , of subject , of literary convention , are , of course , obvious enough ; the difference of sex does not , perhaps , count for much , for there was a distinctly feminine element in “ mr . spectator , ” and in jane austen ’ s genius there was , though nothing mannish , much that was masculine . but the likeness of quality consists in a great number of common subdivisions of quality -- demureness , extreme minuteness of touch , avoidance of loud tones and glaring effects . also there is in both a certain not inhuman or unamiable cruelty . it is the custom with those who judge grossly to contrast the good nature of addison with the savagery of swift , the mildness of miss austen with the boisterousness of fielding and smollett , even with the ferocious practical jokes that her immediate predecessor , miss burney , allowed without very much protest . yet , both in mr. addison and in miss austen there is , though a restrained and well-mannered , an insatiable and ruthless delight in roasting and cutting up a fool . a man in the early eighteenth century , of course , could push this taste further than a lady in the early nineteenth ; and no doubt miss austen ’ s principles , as well as her heart , would have shrunk from such things as the letter from the unfortunate husband in the_ spectator , _who describes , with all the gusto and all the innocence in the world , how his wife and his friend induce him to play at blind-man ’ s-buff . but another_ spectator _letter -- that of the damsel of fourteen who wishes to marry mr. shapely , and assures her selected mentor that “ he admires your_ spectators _mightily ” -- might have been written by a rather more ladylike and intelligent lydia bennet in the days of lydia ’ s great-grandmother ; while , on the other hand , some ( i think unreasonably ) have found “ cynicism ” in touches of miss austen ’ s own , such as her satire of mrs. musgrove ’ s self-deceiving regrets over her son . but this word “ cynical ” is one of the most misused in the english language , especially when , by a glaring and gratuitous falsification of its original sense , it is applied , not to rough and snarling invective , but to gentle and oblique satire . if cynicism means the perception of “ the other side , ” the sense of “ the accepted hells beneath , ” the consciousness that motives are nearly always mixed , and that to seem is not identical with to be -- if this be cynicism , then every man and woman who is not a fool , who does not care to live in a fool ’ s paradise , who has knowledge of nature and the world and life , is a cynic . and in that sense miss austen certainly was one . she may even have been one in the further sense that , like her own mr. bennet , she took an epicurean delight in dissecting , in displaying , in setting at work her fools and her mean persons . i think she did take this delight , and i do not think at all the worse of her for it as a woman , while she was immensely the better for it as an artist._
austen	pride	when mr. bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure . he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ; made no mention of the business that had taken him away ; and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it .
austen	pride	“ and can you likewise declare , that there is no _foundation_ for it ? ” “ i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship . _you_ may ask questions which _i_ shall not choose to answer . ”
austen	pride	“ your picture may be very exact , louisa , ” said bingley ; “ but this was all lost upon me . i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning . her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice . ”
austen	pride	“ i do not mind his not talking to mrs. long , ” said miss lucas , “ but i wish he had danced with eliza. ” “ another time , lizzy , ” said her mother , “ i would not dance with _him_ , if i were you . ”
austen	pride	“ i do not blame jane , ” she continued , “ for jane would have got mr. bingley if she could . but , lizzy ! oh , sister ! it is very hard to think that she might have been mr. collins ’ s wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness . he made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him . the consequence of it is , that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have , and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever . the lucases are very artful people , indeed , sister . they are all for what they can get . i am sorry to say it of them , but so it is . it makes me very nervous and poorly , to be thwarted so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else . however , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves . ”
austen	pride	after breakfast , the girls walked to meryton , to inquire if mr. wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball . he joined them on their entering the town , and attended them to their aunt ’ s , where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody were well talked over . to elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed .
austen	pride	“ i am sure she did not listen ” 393
austen	pride	her aunt now called her to look at a picture . she approached , and saw the likeness of mr. wickham , suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantel-piece . her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it . the housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master ’ s steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expense . “ he is now gone into the army , ” she added ; “ but i am afraid he has turned out very wild . ”
austen	pride	the evening passed quietly , unmarked by anything extraordinary . the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed ; the unacknowledged were silent . darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth ; and elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather _knew_ that she was happy than _felt_ herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her . she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known : she was aware that no one liked him but jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away .
austen	pride	“ when they all removed to brighton , therefore , you had no reason , i suppose , to believe them fond of each other ? ” “ not the slightest . i can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had anything of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away . when first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were . every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months : but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular attention ; and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites . ”
austen	pride	she then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street , where mr. hurst had a house . the next was in these words : -- “ ‘ i do not pretend to regret anything i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope , at some future period , to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known , and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence . i depend on you for that. ’ ” to these high-flown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament : it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr. bingley ’ s being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his .
austen	pride	“ oh , no ! ” said elizabeth . “ in essentials , i believe , he is very much what he ever was. ” while she spoke , wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning . there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention , while she added , --
austen	pride	“ i never saw anyone so shocked . he could not speak a word for full ten minutes . my mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion ! ” “ oh , jane , ” cried elizabeth , “ was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? ”
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ his parting obeisance ” ] chapter xxxvii . [ illustration ] the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning ; and mr. collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting obeisance , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings . to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine and her daughter ; and on his return brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her ladyship , importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her .
austen	pride	“ in the first place , ” replied mr. gardiner , “ there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland. ” “ oh , but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption ! and , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road . ”
austen	pride	“ no , that i am sure i shall not : and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical . i hate such false friends . why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ? ”
austen	pride	mrs. bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet ; it came from netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer . mrs. bennet ’ s eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read , --
austen	pride	heading to chapter xvi . 95
austen	pride	she smiled , but made no answer . he repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence . “ oh , ” said she , “ i heard you before ; but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply . you wanted me , i know , to say ‘ yes , ’ that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ; but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt . i have , therefore , made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all ; and now despise me if you dare . ”
austen	pride	it may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey . from elizabeth ’ s thoughts it was never absent . fixed there by the keenest of all anguish , self-reproach , she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness .
austen	pride	a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth ; but at last , on mrs. bennet ’ s leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , --
austen	pride	“ do you know , mamma , that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard ? and if he does , colonel forster will hire him . my aunt told me so herself on saturday . i shall walk to meryton to-morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when mr. denny comes back from town . ”
austen	pride	when her mother went up to her dressing-room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication . its effect was most extraordinary ; for , on first hearing it , mrs. bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable . nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard , though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them . she began at length to recover , to fidget about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself .
austen	pride	“ you , who so well know my feelings towards mr. darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _appearance_ of what is right . his pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by . i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you , i imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe . his fear of her has always operated , i know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh , which i am certain he has very much at heart . ”
austen	pride	“ you are over scrupulous , surely . i dare say mr. bingley will be very glad to see you ; and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls -- though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy . ”
austen	pride	“ you can not be too much on your guard . risk anything rather than her displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which i should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence . ”
austen	pride	“ and what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? ” “ my father has gone to london , and jane has written to beg my uncle ’ s immediate assistance , and we shall be off , i hope , in half an hour . but nothing can be done ; i know very well that nothing can be done . how is such a man to be worked on ? how are they even to be discovered ? i have not the smallest hope . it is every way horrible ! ”
austen	pride	there was no want of discourse . the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ; and wickham , who happened to sit near elizabeth , began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good-humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her replies . they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world . nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world .
austen	pride	“ i saw you look at me to-day , lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and i know i appeared distressed ; but don ’ t imagine it was from any silly cause . i was only confused for the moment , because i felt that i _should_ be looked at . i do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain . i am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him . not that i am afraid of _myself_ , but i dread other people ’ s remarks . ”
austen	pride	“ after a short survey ” 434
austen	pride	/ * “ my dear lizzy , * / “ i wish you joy . if you love mr. darcy half so well as i do my dear wickham , you must be very happy . it is a great comfort to have you so rich ; and when you have nothing else to do , i hope you will think of us . i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much ; and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help . any place would do of about three or four hundred a year ; but , however , do not speak to mr. darcy about it , if you had rather not .
austen	pride	when this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , mr. collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ; but when mrs. philips understood from him what rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherine ’ s drawing-rooms , and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper ’ s room .
austen	pride	“ he is the best landlord , and the best master , ” said she , “ that ever lived . not like the wild young men now-a-days , who think of nothing but themselves . there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name . some people call him proud ; but i am sure i never saw anything of it . to my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men . ”
austen	pride	“ on the stairs ” 189
austen	pride	“ lady catherine , i have nothing further to say . you know my sentiments. ” “ you are then resolved to have him ? ” “ i have said no such thing . i am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without reference to _you_ , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me . ”
austen	pride	“ i am by no means of opinion , i assure you , ” said he , “ that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself , that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening ; and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours , miss elizabeth , for the two first dances especially ; a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her . ”
austen	pride	elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing . “ you doubt me , ” cried jane , slightly colouring ; “ indeed , you have no reason . he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all . i have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with . thank god i have not _that_ pain . a little time , therefore -- i shall certainly try to get the better -- -- ”
austen	pride	elizabeth made no answer ; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself . she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded upstairs . her mother impatiently met her at the door of her dressing-room , to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself .
austen	pride	“ accompanied by their aunt ” 225
austen	pride	“ it would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression ; but their colour and shape , and the eyelashes , so remarkably fine , might be copied. ” at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs. hurst and elizabeth herself .
austen	pride	her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is . jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from caroline . she accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been lost .
austen	pride	in meryton they parted : the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers ’ wives , and elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick pace , jumping over stiles and springing over puddles , with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty stockings , and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise .
austen	pride	“ i am afraid you do not like your pen . let me mend it for you . i mend pens remarkably well. ” “ thank you -- but i always mend my own. ” “ how can you contrive to write so even ? ”
austen	pride	how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she could not imagine . but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture .
austen	pride	the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken ; but she would not be secure .
austen	pride	“ perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often . at least you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him. ” “ as i did the other day , ” said elizabeth , with a conscious smile ; “ very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_ . but do not imagine that he is always here so often . it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week . you know my mother ’ s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends . but really , and upon my honour , i will try to do what i think to be wisest ; and now i hope you are satisfied . ”
austen	pride	“ with all my heart : i will buy pemberley itself , if darcy will sell it. ” “ i am talking of possibilities , charles. ” “ upon my word , caroline , i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation . ”
austen	pride	elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded ; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved .
austen	pride	lydia was exceedingly fond of him . he was her dear wickham on every occasion ; no one was to be put in competition with him . he did everything best in the world ; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september than anybody else in the country .
austen	pride	the picture gallery , and two or three of the principal bed-rooms , were all that remained to be shown . in the former were many good paintings : but elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcy ’ s , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible .
austen	pride	elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add , that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts . she was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprang . poor charlotte ! it was melancholy to leave her to such society ! but she had chosen it with her eyes open ; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion . her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their dependent concerns , had not yet lost their charms .
austen	pride	“ good heavens ! ” cried elizabeth ; “ but how could _that_ be ? how could his will be disregarded ? why did not you seek legal redress ? ” “ there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law . a man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but mr. darcy chose to doubt it -- or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short , anything or nothing . certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as i was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ; and no less certain is it , that i can not accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it . i have a warm unguarded temper , and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him , and _to_ him , too freely . i can recall nothing worse . but the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me . ”
austen	pride	their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency . his anxiety for jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing ; and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others . she had very little notice from any but him . miss bingley was engrossed by mr. darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for mr. hurst , by whom elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who , when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her .
austen	pride	“ pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ? where does discretion end , and avarice begin ? last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary . ”
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ without once opening his lips ” [ _copyright 1894 by george allen._ ] ] “ are you quite sure , ma ’ am ? is not there a little mistake ? ” said jane . “ i certainly saw mr. darcy speaking to her . ”
austen	pride	when the dancing recommenced , however , and darcy approached to claim her hand , charlotte could not help cautioning her , in a whisper , not to be a simpleton , and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man often times his consequence . elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr. darcy , and reading in her neighbours ’ looks their equal amazement in beholding it . they stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and , at first , was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance . he replied , and was again silent . after a pause of some minutes , she addressed him a second time , with --
austen	pride	“ not at all , ” he replied : “ they were brightened by the exercise. ” a short pause followed this speech , and mrs. hurst began again , -- “ i have an excessive regard for jane bennet , -- she is really a very sweet girl , -- and i wish with all my heart she were well settled . but with such a father and mother , and such low connections , i am afraid there is no chance of it . ”
austen	pride	they walked on without knowing in what direction . there was too much to be thought , and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects . she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who _did_ call on him in her return through london , and there relate her journey to longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth ; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship ’ s apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which _she_ had refused to give . but , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwise .
austen	pride	“ what did you say of me that i did not deserve ? for though your accusations were ill-founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof . it was unpardonable . i can not think of it without abhorrence . ”

austen	pride	“ go , my dear , ” cried her mother , “ and show her ladyship about the different walks . i think she will be pleased with the hermitage. ” elizabeth obeyed ; and , running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest downstairs . as they passed through the hall , lady catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room , and pronouncing them , after a short survey , to be decent-looking rooms , walked on .
austen	pride	“ i know them a little . their brother is a pleasant , gentlemanlike man -- he is a great friend of darcy ’ s. ” “ oh yes , ” said elizabeth drily -- “ mr . darcy is uncommonly kind to mr. bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him . ”
austen	pride	“ and they are really to be married ! ” cried elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves . “ how strange this is ! and for _this_ we are to be thankful . that they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice ! oh , lydia ! ”
austen	pride	“ no -- i can not talk of books in a ball-room ; my head is always full of something else. ” “ the _present_ always occupies you in such scenes -- does it ? ” said he , with a look of doubt .
austen	pride	mrs. hurst and her sister allowed it to be so ; but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of . miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl ; and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose .
austen	pride	again his astonishment was obvious ; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification . she went on , -- “ from the very beginning , from the first moment , i may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that groundwork of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike ; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry . ”
austen	pride	as she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly ; and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth . she directly replied , --
austen	pride	the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs. annesley to miss darcy had been given , to remind her of her post . there was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches , soon collected them round the table .

austen	pride	when they parted , lady catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to hunsford again next year ; and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to courtesy and hold out her hand to both .
austen	pride	elizabeth quietly answered “ undoubtedly ; ” and , after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family . charlotte did not stay much longer ; and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard . it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match . the strangeness of mr. collins ’ s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted . she had always felt that charlotte ’ s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own ; but she could not have supposed it possible that , when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage . charlotte , the wife of mr. collins , was a most humiliating picture ! and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself , and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen .
austen	pride	elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at mr. darcy , was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat . it drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ; and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present . a few weeks , he believed .
austen	pride	elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , “ yes , you know enough of my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_ . after abusing you so abominably to your face , i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations . ”
austen	pride	when he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on ; and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on mr. bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband ’ s not being killed in a duel .
austen	pride	mr. and mrs. bennet 5
austen	pride	darcy smiled and said , “ you are perfectly right . you have employed your time much better . no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting . we neither of us perform to strangers . ”
austen	pride	“ dawson ” 263
austen	pride	“ no , no ; stay where you are ” 67
austen	pride	“ these are home questions -- and perhaps i can not say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature . but in matters of greater weight , i may suffer from the want of money . younger sons can not marry where they like . ”
austen	pride	“ my dear lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these . they will ruin your happiness . you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper . consider mr. collins ’ s respectability , and charlotte ’ s prudent , steady character . remember that she is one of a large family ; that as to fortune it is a most eligible match ; and be ready to believe , for everybody ’ s sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin . ”
austen	pride	“ i hope not so . imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in _me_. ” “ exceed their income ! my dear mr. bennet , ” cried his wife , “ what are you talking of ? why , he has four or five thousand a year , and very likely more. ” then addressing her daughter , “ oh , my dear , dear jane , i am so happy ! i am sure i shan ’ t get a wink of sleep all night . i knew how it would be . i always said it must be so , at last . i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing ! i remember , as soon as ever i saw him , when he first came into hertfordshire last year , i thought how likely it was that you should come together . oh , he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen ! ”
austen	pride	here they were interrupted by lady catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of . elizabeth immediately began playing again . lady catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to darcy , --
austen	pride	an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched ; and already had mrs. bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all . mr. bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , etc . mrs. bennet was quite disconcerted . she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire ; and she began to fear that he might always be flying about from one place to another , and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be . lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his
austen	pride	“ i like her appearance , ” said elizabeth , struck with other ideas . “ she looks sickly and cross . yes , she will do for him very well . she will make him a very proper wife . ”
austen	pride	“ this is quite shocking ! he deserves to be publicly disgraced. ” “ some time or other he _will_ be -- but it shall not be by _me_ . till i can forget his father , i can never defy or expose _him_ . ”
austen	pride	“ all this she must possess , ” added darcy ; “ and to all she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading. ” “ i am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women . i rather wonder now at your knowing _any_ . ”
austen	pride	“ and my aunt philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good , ” added kitty . such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn house . elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame . she felt anew the justice of mr. darcy ’ s objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend .
austen	pride	miss bingley saw , or suspected , enough to be jealous ; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth .
austen	pride	“ i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! ” cried jane . “ oh , lizzy , why am i thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all ? if i could but see you as happy ! if there were but such another man for you ! ”
austen	pride	“ oh , you mean jane , i suppose , because he danced with her twice . to be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her -- indeed , i rather believe he _did_ -- i heard something about it -- but i hardly know what -- something about mr. robinson . ”
austen	pride	“ let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility. ” “ i never can be thankful , mr. bennet , for anything about the entail . how anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one ’ s own daughters i can not understand ; and all for the sake of mr. collins , too ! why should _he_ have it more than anybody else ? ”
austen	pride	“ i admire all my three sons-in-law highly , ” said he . “ wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ; but i think i shall like _your_ husband quite as well as jane ’ s. ” [ illustration : “ the obsequious civility . ”
austen	pride	“ e . gardiner. ” mr. bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham ’ s removal from the -- -- shire , as clearly as mr. gardiner could do . but mrs. bennet was not so well pleased with it . lydia ’ s being settled in the north , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and , besides , it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody , and had so many favourites .
austen	pride	“ yours , ” etc . as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind . such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expenses , she frequently sent them . it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and heedless of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills . their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme . they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation , and always spending more than they ought . his affection for her soon sunk into indifference : hers lasted a little longer ; and , in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her . though darcy could never receive _him_ at pemberley , yet , for elizabeth ’ s sake , he assisted him further in his profession . lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath ; and with the bingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long , that even bingley ’ s good-humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone .
austen	pride	elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing-room . mrs. bennet ’ s schemes for this day were ineffectual . bingley was everything that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter . his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter .
austen	pride	elizabeth looked at darcy , to see how cordially he assented to his cousin ’ s praise : but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_ , had she been his relation .
austen	pride	“ because honour , decorum , prudence -- nay , interest -- forbid it . yes , miss bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all . you will be censured , slighted , and despised , by everyone connected with him . your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us . ”
austen	pride	if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time ; for , from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball , there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once . no aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after ; the very shoe-roses for netherfield were got by proxy . even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr. wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday , saturday , sunday , and monday endurable to kitty and lydia .
austen	pride	“ what is there of good to be expected ? ” said he , taking the letter from his pocket ; “ but perhaps you would like to read it. ” elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand . jane now came up .
austen	pride	“ mr . darcy , i am a very selfish creature , and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding yours . i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister . ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it . were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express . ”
austen	pride	elizabeth smiled . “ lizzy , you must not do so . you must not suspect me . it mortifies me . i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it . i am perfectly satisfied , from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection . it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing , than any other man . ”
austen	pride	in the evening , soon after mr. bennet withdrew to the library , she saw mr. darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme . she did not fear her father ’ s opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means ; that _she_ , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till mr. darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile . in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , “ go to your father ; he wants you in the library. ” she was gone directly .
austen	pride	the boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would ; and the argument ended only with the visit . [ illustration ] [ illustration ] chapter vi . [ illustration ] the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield . the visit was returned in due form . miss bennet ’ s pleasing manners grew on the good-will of mrs. hurst and miss bingley ; and though the mother was found to be intolerable , and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards the two eldest . by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to jane , such as it was , had a value , as arising , in all probability , from the influence of their brother ’ s admiration . it was generally evident , whenever they met , that he _did_ admire her ; and to _her_ it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and an uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent . she mentioned this to her friend , miss lucas .
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ unable to utter a syllable ” [ _copyright 1894 by george allen._ ] ] chapter lix . [ illustration ] “ my dear lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? ” was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table . she had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge . she coloured as she spoke ; but neither that , nor anything else , awakened a suspicion of the truth .
austen	pride	“ oh , jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened ! ” “ perhaps it would have been better , ” replied her sister . “ but to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable . ”
austen	pride	the first part of mrs. gardiner ’ s business , on her arrival , was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions . when this was done , she had a less active part to play . it became her turn to listen . mrs. bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of . they had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister . two of her girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing in it .
austen	pride	“ you persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him ? ” “ yes , in conjunction with his friend. ” “ i can not believe it . why should they try to influence him ? they can only wish his happiness ; and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it . ”
austen	pride	“ but you are not entitled to know _mine_ ; nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit. ” “ let me be rightly understood . this match , to which you have the presumption to aspire , can never take place . no , never . mr. darcy is engaged to _my daughter_ . now , what have you to say ? ”
austen	pride	the colour now rushed into elizabeth ’ s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself , when her father continued , --
austen	pride	elizabeth was distressed . she felt that she had no business at pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it . she must own that she was tired of great houses : after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains .
austen	pride	[ illustration ] chapter x . [ illustration ] the day passed much as the day before had done . mrs. hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid , who continued , though slowly , to mend ; and , in the evening , elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room . the loo table , however , did not appear . mr. darcy was writing , and miss bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister . mr. hurst and mr. bingley were at piquet , and mrs. hurst was observing their game .
austen	pride	“ we will go as far as meryton with you , ” said catherine and lydia . elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together . “ if we make haste , ” said lydia , as they walked along , “ perhaps we may see something of captain carter , before he goes . ”
austen	pride	“ and do you really know all this ? ” cried mrs. gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive . “ i do , indeed , ” replied elizabeth , colouring . “ i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to mr. darcy ; and you , yourself , when last at longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him . and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty -- which it is not worth while to relate ; but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless . from what he said of miss darcy , i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl . yet he knew to the contrary himself . he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her . ”
austen	pride	but self , though it would intrude , could not engross her . lydia -- the humiliation , the misery she was bringing on them all -- soon swallowed up every private care ; and covering her face with her handkerchief , elizabeth was soon lost to everything else ; and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner which , though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , --
austen	pride	heading to chapter xx . 139
austen	pride	“ i dislike it very much , ” he replied ; “ but it must be done. ” and so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house . “ and -- may i ask ? ” said elizabeth ; “ but the terms , i suppose , must be complied with . ”
austen	pride	“ and this is your real opinion ! this is your final resolve ! very well . i shall now know how to act . do not imagine , miss bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified . i came to try you . i hoped to find you reasonable ; but depend upon it i will carry my point . ”
austen	pride	“ what is that you are saying , fitzwilliam ? what is it you are talking of ? what are you telling miss bennet ? let me hear what it is. ” “ we were talking of music , madam , ” said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply .
austen	pride	“ he did not talk to me of his own arts , ” said fitzwilliam , smiling . “ he only told me what i have now told you. ” elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with indignation . after watching her a little , fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful .
austen	pride	“ lady catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman , indeed , ” added charlotte , “ and a most attentive neighbour. ” “ very true , my dear , that is exactly what i say . she is the sort of woman whom one can not regard with too much deference . ”
austen	pride	“ my dearest child , ” she cried , “ i can think of nothing else . ten thousand a year , and very likely more ! ‘ tis as good as a lord ! and a special licence -- you must and shall be married by a special licence . but , my dearest love , tell me what dish mr. darcy is particularly fond of , that i may have it to-morrow . ”
austen	pride	“ william collins. ” “ at four o ’ clock , therefore , we may expect this peace-making gentleman , ” said mr. bennet , as he folded up the letter . “ he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man , upon my word ; and , i doubt not , will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again . ”
austen	pride	the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt . it soothed , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self-attracted by the rest of her family ; and as she considered that jane ’ s disappointment had , in fact , been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known before .
austen	pride	“ my dear mr. bennet , ” said his lady to him one day , “ have you heard that netherfield park is let at last ? ” mr. bennet replied that he had not . “ but it is , ” returned she ; “ for mrs. long has just been here , and she told me all about it . ”
austen	pride	“ and my mother -- how is she ? how are you all ? ” “ my mother is tolerably well , i trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken . she is upstairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all . she does not yet leave her dressing-room . mary and kitty , thank heaven ! are quite well . ”
austen	pride	“ you may depend on it , ” replied the other , “ for mrs. nichols was in meryton last night : i saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certainly true . he comes down on thursday , at the latest , very likely on wednesday . she was going to the butcher ’ s , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed . ”
austen	pride	“ perhaps , ” said darcy , “ i should have judged better had i sought an introduction , but i am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers. ” “ shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? ” said elizabeth , still addressing colonel fitzwilliam . “ shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill-qualified to recommend himself to strangers ? ”
austen	pride	elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that , had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece ; nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyship ’ s indignation would have been . “ what would she have said ? how would she have behaved ? ” were the questions with which she amused herself .
austen	pride	_this swiftian quality appears in the present novel as it appears nowhere else in the character of the immortal , the ineffable mr. collins . mr. collins is really_ great ; _far greater than anything addison ever did , almost great enough for fielding or for swift himself . it has been said that no one ever was like him . but in the first place , _ he _was like him ; he is there -- alive , imperishable , more real than hundreds of prime ministers and archbishops , of “ metals , semi-metals , and distinguished philosophers. ” in the second place , it is rash , i think , to conclude that an actual mr. collins was impossible or non-existent at the end of the eighteenth century . it is very interesting that we possess , in this same gallery , what may be called a spoiled first draught , or an unsuccessful study of him , in john dashwood . the formality , the under-breeding , the meanness , are there ; but the portrait is only half alive , and is felt to be even a little unnatural . mr. collins is perfectly natural , and perfectly alive . in fact , for all the “ miniature , ” there is something gigantic in the way in which a certain side , and more than one , of humanity , and especially eighteenth-century humanity , its philistinism , its well-meaning but hide-bound morality , its formal pettiness , its grovelling respect for rank , its materialism , its selfishness , receives exhibition . i will not admit that one speech or one action of this inestimable man is incapable of being reconciled with reality , and i should not wonder if many of these words and actions are historically true._
austen	pride	at length , however , mrs. bennet had no more to say ; and lady lucas , who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken . elizabeth now began to revive . but not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company . by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , -- but in vain ; mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song . elizabeth ’ s eyes were fixed on her , with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another . mary ’ s powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; her voice was weak , and her manner affected . elizabeth was in agonies . she looked at jane to see how she bore it ; but jane was very composedly talking to bingley . she looked at his two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision at each other , and at darcy , who continued , however , impenetrably grave . she looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest mary should be singing all night . he took the hint , and , when mary had finished her second song , said aloud , --
austen	pride	bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations . elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes . how mr. darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell . “ it is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , ” continued her mother ; “ but at the same time , mr. bingley , it is very hard to have her taken away from me . they are gone down to newcastle , a place quite northward it seems , and there they are to stay , i do not know how long . his regiment is there ; for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the -- -- shire , and of his being gone into the regulars . thank heaven ! he has _some_ friends , though , perhaps , not so many as he deserves . ”
austen	pride	the next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand . “ lizzy , ” said he , “ i was going to look for you : come into my room . ”
austen	pride	but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she made no answer . “ well , lizzy , ” continued her mother , soon afterwards , “ and so the collinses live very comfortable , do they ? well , well , i only hope it will last . and what sort of table do they keep ? charlotte is an excellent manager , i dare say . if she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough . there is nothing extravagant in _their_ housekeeping , i dare say . ”
austen	pride	elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , -- “ you are mistaken , mr. darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner . ”
austen	pride	“ you are a very strange creature by way of a friend ! -- always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody ! if my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable ; but as it is , i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers. ” on miss lucas ’ s persevering , however , she added , “ very well ; if it must be so , it must. ” and gravely glancing at mr. darcy , “ there is a very fine old saying , which everybody here is of course familiar with -- ‘ keep your breath to cool your porridge , ’ -- and i shall keep mine to swell my song . ”
austen	pride	miss darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place . with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself . since her being at lambton , she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud ; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy . she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable .
austen	pride	“ offended two or three young ladies ” 177
austen	pride	“ then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , ” said mrs. bennet ; “ and if i were to see you at it , i should take away your bottle directly . ”
austen	pride	“ whatever my connections may be , ” said elizabeth , “ if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to _you_. ” “ tell me , once for all , are you engaged to him ? ”
austen	pride	heading to chapter xii . 75
austen	pride	“ they have both , ” said she , “ been deceived , i dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea . interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other . it is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them , without actual blame on either side . ”
austen	pride	she had no fear of its spreading farther , through his means . there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended ; but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister ’ s frailty would have mortified her so much . not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself ; for at any rate there seemed a gulf impassable between them . had lydia ’ s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that mr. darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned .
austen	pride	“ i may thank you , eliza , for this piece of civility . mr. darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me. ” elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the door-bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room . colonel fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman . mr. darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to mrs. collins ; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure . elizabeth merely courtesied to him , without saying a word .
austen	pride	“ why should you be surprised , my dear eliza ? do you think it incredible that mr. collins should be able to procure any woman ’ s good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? ”
austen	pride	_the secret of that charm many men and not a few women , from miss austen herself downwards , have felt , and like most charms it is a thing rather to be felt than to be explained . elizabeth of course belongs to the_ allegro _or_ allegra _division of the army of venus . miss austen was always provokingly chary of description in regard to her beauties ; and except the fine eyes , and a hint or two that she had at any rate sometimes a bright complexion , and was not very tall , we hear nothing about her looks . but her chief difference from other heroines of the lively type seems to lie first in her being distinctly clever -- almost strong-minded , in the better sense of that objectionable word -- and secondly in her being entirely destitute of ill-nature for all her propensity to tease and the sharpness of her tongue . elizabeth can give at least as good as she gets when she is attacked ; but she never “ scratches , ” and she never attacks first . some of the merest obsoletenesses of phrase and manner give one or two of her early speeches a slight pertness , but that is nothing , and when she comes to serious business , as in the great proposal scene with darcy ( which is , as it should be , the climax of the interest of the book ) , and in the final ladies ’ battle with lady catherine , she is unexceptionable . then too she is a perfectly natural girl . she does not disguise from herself or anybody that she resents darcy ’ s first ill-mannered personality with as personal a feeling . ( by the way , the reproach that the ill-manners of this speech are overdone is certainly unjust ; for things of the same kind , expressed no doubt less stiltedly but more coarsely , might have been heard in more than one ball-room during this very year from persons who ought to have been no worse bred than darcy . ) and she lets the injury done to jane and the contempt shown to the rest of her family aggravate this resentment in the healthiest way in the world._
austen	pride	elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet . as soon as they entered , bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , “ mrs . bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to-day ? ”
austen	pride	her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious . “ lizzy , ” said he , “ what are you doing ? are you out of your senses to be accepting this man ? have not you always hated him ? ”
austen	pride	“ i wish it may. ” “ but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take pemberley for a kind of model . there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire . ”
austen	pride	“ that is all very proper and civil , i am sure , ” said mrs. bennet , “ and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman . it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her . does she live near you , sir ? ”
austen	pride	he smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said . “ very well ; that reply will do for the present . perhaps , by-and-by , i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones ; but _now_ we may be silent . ”
austen	pride	elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing . “ from what we have seen of him , ” continued mrs. gardiner , “ i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor wickham . he has not an ill-natured look . on the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks . and there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart . but , to be sure , the good lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character ! i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes . but he is a liberal master , i suppose , and _that_ , in the eye of a servant , comprehends every virtue . ”
austen	pride	“ i ’ m the tallest ” 9
austen	pride	but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentlemanlike appearance , walking with an officer on the other side of the way . the officer was the very mr. denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire , and he bowed as they passed . all were struck with the stranger ’ s air , all wondered who he could be ; and kitty and lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the pavement , when the two gentlemen , turning back , had reached the same spot . mr. denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to introduce his friend , mr. wickham , who had returned with him the day before from town , and , he was happy to say , had accepted a commission in their corps . this was exactly as it should be ; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming . his appearance was greatly in his favour : he had all the best parts of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address . the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation -- a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street . on distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities . bingley was the principal spokesman , and miss bennet the principal object . he was then , he said , on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her . mr. darcy corroborated it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger ; and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting . both changed colour , one looked white , the other red . mr. wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat -- a salutation which mr. darcy just deigned to return . what could be the meaning of it ? it was impossible to imagine ; it was impossible not to long to know .
austen	pride	“ very true ; and if i had my will we should . but , my dear lydia , i don ’ t at all like your going such a way off . must it be so ? ” “ oh , lord ! yes ; there is nothing in that . i shall like it of all things . you and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us . we shall be at newcastle all the winter , and i dare say there will be some balls , and i will take care to get good partners for them all . ”
austen	pride	“ on the evening before my going to london , ” said he , “ i made a confession to him , which i believe i ought to have made long ago . i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent . his surprise was great . he had never had the slightest suspicion . i told him , moreover , that i believed myself mistaken in supposing , as i had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , i felt no doubt of their happiness together . ”
austen	pride	the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret . mrs. bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs. philips , and she ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton .
austen	pride	“ you are quite right . to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever . he is now , perhaps , sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re-establish a character . we must not make him desperate . ”
austen	pride	“ when you have killed all your own birds , mr. bingley , ” said her mother , “ i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mr. bennet ’ s manor . i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the coveys for you . ”
austen	pride	“ i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have i anything to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing concern . would to heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress ! but i will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks . this unfortunate affair will , i fear , prevent my sister ’ s having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to-day . ”
austen	pride	this was praise of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas . that he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion . her keenest attention was awakened : she longed to hear more ; and was grateful to her uncle for saying , --
austen	pride	“ i desire you will do no such thing . lizzy is not a bit better than the others : and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane , nor half so good-humoured as lydia . but you are always giving _her_ the preference . ”
austen	pride	“ they have none of them much to recommend them , ” replied he : “ they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters . ”
austen	pride	“ certainly , ” he replied , biting his lips . elizabeth hoped she had silenced him ; but he soon afterwards said , -- “ i was surprised to see darcy in town last month . we passed each other several times . i wonder what he can be doing there . ”
austen	pride	when the party broke up , lydia returned with mrs. forster to meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning . the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic . kitty was the only one who shed tears ; but she did weep from vexation and envy . mrs. bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible , -- advice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ; and , in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard .
austen	pride	“ perhaps that is not possible for anyone . but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule. ” “ such as vanity and pride . ”
austen	pride	in this room they were received by miss darcy , who was sitting there with mrs. hurst and miss bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in london . georgiana ’ s reception of them was very civil , but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved . mrs. gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her .
austen	pride	“ on looking up ” 228
austen	pride	mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield ; and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter . bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at longbourn ; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ; unless when some barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough detested , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept .
austen	pride	but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was . an union of a different tendency , and precluding the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family .
austen	pride	“ my dear madam , ” he replied , “ this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what i have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible . ”
austen	pride	“ i will not trust myself on the subject , ” replied wickham ; “ _i_ can hardly be just to him. ” elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , “ to treat in such a manner the godson , the friend , the favourite of his father ! ” she could have added , “ a young man , too , like _you_ , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable. ” but she contented herself with -- “ and one , too , who had probably been his own companion from childhood , connected together , as i think you said , in the closest manner . ”
austen	pride	“ these are heavy misfortunes , ” replied elizabeth . “ but the wife of mr. darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine . ”
austen	pride	“ i do not at all know ; but i _heard_ nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield . i hope your plans in favour of the -- -- shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood . ”
austen	pride	miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour . it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth ; but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said , --
austen	pride	bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business . they then went away . mrs. bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year .
austen	pride	“ you can be at no loss , miss bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither . your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why i come. ” elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment .
austen	pride	“ no , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night. ” “ that would be a good scheme , ” said elizabeth , “ if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home . ”
austen	pride	but wishes were vain ; or , at best , could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour . had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure . an hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and mr. gardiner , meanwhile , having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ; and elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to longbourn .
austen	pride	“ i deserve neither such praise nor such censure , ” cried elizabeth ; “ i am _not_ a great reader , and i have pleasure in many things. ” “ in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure , ” said bingley ; “ and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well . ”
austen	pride	heading to chapter xxxvi . 253
austen	pride	“ i should like balls infinitely better , ” she replied , “ if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting . it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day . ”
austen	pride	mrs. gardiner had seen pemberley , and known the late mr. darcy by character perfectly well . here , consequently , was an inexhaustible subject of discourse . in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute description which wickham could give , and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was delighting both him and herself . on being made acquainted with the present mr. darcy ’ s treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman ’ s reputed disposition , when quite a lad , which might agree with it ; and was confident , at last , that she recollected having heard mr. fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill-natured boy .
austen	pride	“ will you come and see me ? ” 181
austen	pride	[ illustration ] chapter xlix . [ illustration ] two days after mr. bennet ’ s return , as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to miss bennet , “ i beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so i took the liberty of coming to ask . ”
austen	pride	“ how strange ! ” cried elizabeth . “ how abominable ! i wonder that the very pride of this mr. darcy has not made him just to you . if from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest , -- for dishonesty i must call it . ”
austen	pride	mrs. gardiner was surprised and concerned : but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs , to think of anything else . fatigued as she had been by the morning ’ s walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years ’ discontinuance .
austen	pride	[ illustration ] chapter lxi . [ illustration ] happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs. bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters . with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs. bingley , and talked of mrs. darcy , may be guessed . i wish i could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well-informed woman for the rest of her life ; though , perhaps , it was lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly .
austen	pride	pemberley was now georgiana ’ s home ; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see . they were able to love each other , even as well as they intended . georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively , sportive manner of talking to her brother . he , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry . her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way . by elizabeth ’ s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself .
austen	pride	“ my uncle is to send a servant for us. ” “ oh ! your uncle ! he keeps a man-servant , does he ? i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things . where shall you change horses ? oh , bromley , of course . if you mention my name at the bell , you will be attended to . ”
austen	pride	elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word . after a short pause , her companion added , “ you are too generous to trifle with me . if your feelings are still what they were last april , tell me so at once . _my_ affections and wishes are unchanged ; but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . ”
austen	pride	“ the spiteful old ladies ” 377
austen	pride	no one made any reply . she then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when , hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said , --
austen	pride	“ for the liveliness of your mind i did. ” “ you may as well call it impertinence at once . it was very little less . the fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention . you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking , and looking , and thinking for _your_ approbation alone . i roused and interested you , because i was so unlike _them_ . had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it : but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you . there -- i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , i begin to think it perfectly reasonable . to be sure you know no actual good of me -- but nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love . ”
austen	pride	after welcoming their sisters , they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords , exclaiming , “ is not this nice ? is not this an agreeable surprise ? ”
austen	pride	in this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do : in half a minute the letter was unfolded again ; and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence . the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late mr. darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words . so far each recital confirmed the other ; but when she came to the will , the difference was great . what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory ; and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other , and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err . but when she read and re-read , with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of wickham ’ s resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate . she put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality -- deliberated on the probability of each statement -- but with little success . on both sides it was only assertion . again she read on . but every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render mr. darcy ’ s conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole .
austen	pride	[ illustration : [ _copyright 1894 by george allen._ ] ] chapter v. [ illustration ] within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate . sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune , and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty . the distinction had , perhaps , been felt too strongly . it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and , quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton , denominated from that period lucas lodge ; where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and , unshackled by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world . for , though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious ; on the contrary , he was all attention to everybody . by nature inoffensive , friendly , and obliging , his presentation at st. james ’ s had made him courteous .
austen	pride	“ good heaven ! what is to become of us ? what are we to do ? ” would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe . “ how can you be smiling so , lizzy ? ” their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion five-and-twenty years ago .
austen	pride	“ yes , very indifferent , indeed , ” said elizabeth , laughingly . “ oh , jane ! take care. ” “ my dear lizzy , you can not think me so weak as to be in danger now. ” “ i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever . ”
austen	pride	“ you can not be more than twenty , i am sure , -- therefore you need not conceal your age. ” “ i am not one-and-twenty. ” when the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed . lady catherine , sir william , and mr. and mrs. collins sat down to quadrille ; and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino , the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs. jenkinson to make up her party . their table was superlatively stupid . scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when mrs. jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourgh ’ s being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light . a great deal more passed at the other table . lady catherine was generally speaking -- stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself . mr. collins was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologizing if he thought he won too many . sir william did not say much . he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names .
austen	pride	miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject . elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse , and that she could not leave her . bingley urged mr. jones ’ s being sent for immediately ; while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians . this she would not hear of ; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother ’ s proposal ; and it was settled that mr. jones should be sent for early in the morning , if miss bennet were not decidedly better . bingley was quite uncomfortable ; his sisters declared that they were miserable . they solaced their wretchedness , however , by duets after supper ; while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister .
austen	pride	mrs. bennet , with great civility , begged her ladyship to take some refreshment : but lady catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating anything ; and then , rising up , said to elizabeth , --
austen	pride	mr. wickham ’ s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family . they saw him often , and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve . the whole of what elizabeth had already heard , his claims on mr. darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ; and everybody was pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr. darcy before they had known anything of the matter .
austen	pride	“ it taught me to hope , ” said he , “ as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before . i knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly . ”
austen	pride	her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered . miss bennet had slept ill , and though up , was very feverish , and not well enough to leave her room . elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ; and jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance . she was not equal , however , to much conversation ; and when miss bingley left them together , could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with . elizabeth silently attended her .
austen	pride	“ how can you be so silly , ” cried her mother , “ as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt ! you will not be fit to be seen when you get there . ”
austen	pride	“ can you come to-morrow ? ” yes , he had no engagement at all for to-morrow ; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity . he came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them dressed . in ran mrs. bennet to her daughters ’ room , in her dressing-gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out , --
austen	pride	“ she had better have stayed at home , ” cried elizabeth : “ perhaps she _meant_ well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one can not see too little of one ’ s neighbours . assistance is impossible ; condolence , insufferable . let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . ”
austen	pride	dedication vii
austen	pride	elizabeth replied that it was . “ very well -- and this offer of marriage you have refused ? ” “ i have , sir. ” “ very well . we now come to the point . your mother insists upon your accepting it . is it not so , mrs. bennet ? ”
austen	pride	the gardiners stayed a week at longbourn ; and what with the philipses , the lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement . mrs. bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner . when the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers mr. wickham was sure to be one ; and on these occasions mrs. gardiner , rendered suspicious by elizabeth ’ s warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both . without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment .
austen	pride	“ how nicely we are crammed in ! ” 272
austen	pride	“ you are too sensible a girl , lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ; and , therefore , i am not afraid of speaking openly . seriously , i would have you be on your guard . do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him , in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent . i have nothing to say against _him_ : he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , i should think you could not do better . but as it is -- you must not let your fancy run away with you . you have sense , and we all expect you to use it . your father would depend on _your_ resolution and good conduct , i am sure . you must not disappoint your father . ”
austen	pride	“ if one could but go to brighton ! ” observed mrs. bennet . “ oh yes ! -- if one could but go to brighton ! but papa is so disagreeable. ” “ a little sea-bathing would set me up for ever . ”
austen	pride	mr. darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour , till sir william thus began : --
austen	pride	“ and mary king is safe ! ” added elizabeth ; “ safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune. ” “ she is a great fool for going away , if she liked him. ” “ but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side , ” said jane .
austen	pride	her father lifted up his eyes , jane was distressed , elizabeth looked expressively at lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , --
austen	pride	“ only think of its being three months , ” she cried , “ since i went away : it seems but a fortnight , i declare ; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time . good gracious ! when i went away , i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again ! though i thought it would be very good fun if i was . ”
austen	pride	/ * nind “ my dearest lizzie , * / “ i find myself very unwell this morning , which , i suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday . my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better . they insist also on my seeing mr. jones -- therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me -- and , excepting a sore throat and a headache , there is not much the matter with me .
austen	pride	elizabeth longed to observe that mr. bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself . she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at , and it was rather too early to begin . in anticipating the happiness of bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house . in the hall they parted .
austen	pride	“ i never saw a more promising inclination ; he was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her . every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable . at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance ; and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer . could there be finer symptoms ? is not general incivility the very essence of love ? ”
austen	pride	“ at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted. ” “ your coming to longbourn , to see me and my family , ” said elizabeth coolly , “ will be rather a confirmation of it -- if , indeed , such a report is in existence . ”
austen	pride	kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters . in society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great . she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia ; and , removed from the influence of lydia ’ s example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less insipid . from the further disadvantage of lydia ’ s society she was of course carefully kept ; and though mrs. wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going .
austen	pride	when dinner was over , she returned directly to jane , and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room . her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed , -- a mixture of pride and impertinence : she had no conversation , no style , no taste , no beauty . mrs. hurst thought the same , and added , --
austen	pride	“ no , ” said colonel fitzwilliam , “ that is an advantage which he must divide with me . i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy. ” “ are you , indeed ? and pray what sort of a guardian do you make ? does your charge give you much trouble ? young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage ; and if she has the true darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way . ”
austen	pride	her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable . sir william lucas , and his daughter maria , a good-humoured girl , but as empty-headed as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise . elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known sir william ’ s too long . he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood ; and his civilities were worn out , like his information .
austen	pride	“ that is not an unnatural surmise , ” said fitzwilliam ; “ but it is lessening the honour of my cousin ’ s triumph very sadly. ” this was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr. darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage . there , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard . it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected . there could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom mr. darcy could have such boundless influence . that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr. bingley and jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them . if his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , _he_ was the cause -- his pride and caprice were the cause -- of all that jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer . he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted .
austen	pride	mr. bennet ’ s expectations were fully answered . his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped ; and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance , and , except in an occasional glance at elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure .
austen	pride	she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine ’ s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte ’ s observation , and hurried her away to her room .
austen	pride	the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents , about a twelvemonth ago , was now brought forward again . “ as soon as ever mr. bingley comes , my dear , ” said mrs. bennet , “ you will wait on him , of course . ”
austen	pride	“ but why all this secrecy ? why any fear of detection ? why must their marriage be private ? oh , no , no -- this is not likely . his most particular friend , you see by jane ’ s account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her . wickham will never marry a woman without some money . he can not afford it . and what claims has lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ? as to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , i am not able to judge ; for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce . but as to your other objection , i am afraid it will hardly hold good . lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father ’ s behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that _he_ would do as little and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter . ”
austen	pride	“ ah , you do not know what i suffer. ” “ but i hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood . ”
austen	pride	between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character . bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness , openness , and ductility of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied . on the strength of darcy ’ s regard , bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion . in understanding , darcy was the superior . bingley was by no means deficient ; but darcy was clever . he was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious ; and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting . in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage . bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared ; darcy was continually giving offence .
austen	pride	mr. bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ; and , affectionately taking her hand , said , in reply , -- “ do not make yourself uneasy , my love . wherever you and jane are known , you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of -- or i may say , three -- very silly sisters . we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton . let her go , then . colonel forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody . at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here . the officers will find women better worth their notice . let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance . at any rate , she can not grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life . ”
austen	pride	“ if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield , ” said mrs. bennet to her husband , “ and all the others equally well married , i shall have nothing to wish for . ”
austen	pride	[ illustration : “ he came down to see the place ” [ _copyright 1894 by george allen._ ] ] this was invitation enough . “ why , my dear , you must know , mrs. long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england ; that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr. morris immediately ; that he is to take possession before michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week . ”
austen	pride	“ unless where they like women of fortune , which i think they very often do. ” “ our habits of expense make us too dependent , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money . ”
austen	pride	[ illustration ] chapter xiii [ illustration ] “ i hope , my dear , ” said mr. bennet to his wife , as they were at breakfast the next morning , “ that you have ordered a good dinner to-day , because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party . ”
austen	pride	“ colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on lydia ’ s side , but nothing to give him any alarm . i am so grieved for him . his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost . he _was_ coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey . ”
austen	pride	“ caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter . i will read it to you . “ ‘ when my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to london might be concluded in three or four days ; but as we are certain it can not be so , and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel . many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter : i wish i could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the crowd , but of that i despair . i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you . ’
austen	pride	“ did not you think , mr. darcy , that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when i was teasing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton ? ” “ with great energy ; but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic . ”
austen	pride	“ i assure you , madam , ” he replied , “ that she does not need such advice . she practises very constantly. ” “ so much the better . it can not be done too much ; and when i next write to her , i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account . i often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice . i have told miss bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ; and though mrs. collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as i have often told her , to come to rosings every day , and play on the pianoforte in mrs. jenkinson ’ s room . she would be in nobody ’ s way , you know , in that part of the house . ”
austen	pride	“ the men shan ’ t come and part us , i am determined . we want none of them ; do we ? ” darcy had walked away to another part of the room . she followed him with her eyes , envied everyone to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee , and then was enraged against herself for being so silly !
austen	pride	the wedding took place : the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door , and everybody had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual . elizabeth soon heard from her friend , and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it ever had been : that it should be equally unreserved was impossible . elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over ; and , though determined not to slacken as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been rather than what was . charlotte ’ s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness : there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like lady catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ; though , when the letters were read , elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen . she wrote cheerfully , seemed surrounded with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise . the house , furniture , neighbourhood , and roads , were all to her taste , and lady catherine ’ s behaviour was most friendly and obliging . it was mr. collins ’ s picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened ; and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest .
austen	pride	“ in vain have i struggled . it will not do . my feelings will not be repressed . you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you. ” elizabeth ’ s astonishment was beyond expression . she stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent . this he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed . he spoke well ; but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride . his sense of her inferiority , of its being a degradation , of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit .
austen	pride	_the goodness of the minor characters in_ pride and prejudice _has been already alluded to , and it makes a detailed dwelling on their beauties difficult in any space , and impossible in this . mrs. bennet we have glanced at , and it is not easy to say whether she is more exquisitely amusing or more horribly true . much the same may be said of kitty and lydia ; but it is not every author , even of genius , who would have differentiated with such unerring skill the effects of folly and vulgarity of intellect and disposition working upon the common weaknesses of woman at such different ages . with mary , miss austen has taken rather less pains , though she has been even more unkind to her ; not merely in the text , but , as we learn from those interesting traditional appendices which mr. austen leigh has given us , in dooming her privately to marry “ one of mr. philips ’ s clerks. ” the habits of first copying and then retailing moral sentiments , of playing and singing too long in public , are , no doubt , grievous and criminal ; but perhaps poor mary was rather the scapegoat of the sins of blue stockings in that fordyce-belectured generation . it is at any rate difficult not to extend to her a share of the respect and affection ( affection and respect of a peculiar kind ; doubtless ) , with which one regards mr. collins , when she draws the moral of lydia ’ s fall . i sometimes wish that the exigencies of the story had permitted miss austen to unite these personages , and thus at once achieve a notable mating and soothe poor mrs. bennet ’ s anguish over the entail._
austen	pride	at length the chaise arrived , the trunks were fastened on , the parcels placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready . after an affectionate parting between the friends , elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr. collins ; and as they walked down the garden , he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to mr. and mrs. gardiner , though unknown . he then handed her in , maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some consternation , that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings .
austen	pride	elizabeth could bear it no longer . she got up and ran out of the room ; and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining-parlour . she then joined them soon enough to see lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother ’ s right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister , --
austen	pride	elizabeth bennet had been obliged , by the scarcity of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ; and during part of that time , mr. darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr. bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it .
austen	pride	“ we acted with the best intentions. ” “ could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia ’ s note to his wife ? ” “ he brought it with him for us to see. ” jane then took it from her pocket-book , and gave it to elizabeth . these were the contents : --
austen	pride	“ what is mr. darcy to me , pray , that i should be afraid of him ? i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear . ”
austen	pride	“ oh , papa , what news ? what news ? have you heard from my uncle ? ” “ yes , i have had a letter from him by express. ” “ well , and what news does it bring -- good or bad ? ”

austen	sense	chapter i . the family of dashwood had long been settled in sussex . their estate was large , and their residence was at norland park , in the centre of their property , where , for many generations , they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance . the late owner of this estate was a single man , who lived to a very advanced age , and who for many years of his life , had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister . but her death , which happened ten years before his own , produced a great alteration in his home ; for to supply her loss , he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew mr. henry dashwood , the legal inheritor of the norland estate , and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it . in the society of his nephew and niece , and their children , the old gentleman ’ s days were comfortably spent . his attachment to them all increased . the constant attention of mr. and mrs. henry dashwood to his wishes , which proceeded not merely from interest , but from goodness of heart , gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive ; and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence .
austen	sense	by a former marriage , mr. henry dashwood had one son : by his present lady , three daughters . the son , a steady respectable young man , was amply provided for by the fortune of his mother , which had been large , and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age . by his own marriage , likewise , which happened soon afterwards , he added to his wealth . to him therefore the succession to the norland estate was not so really important as to his sisters ; for their fortune , independent of what might arise to them from their father ’ s inheriting that property , could be but small . their mother had nothing , and their father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal ; for the remaining moiety of his first wife ’ s fortune was also secured to her child , and he had only a life-interest in it .
austen	sense	the old gentleman died : his will was read , and like almost every other will , gave as much disappointment as pleasure . he was neither so unjust , nor so ungrateful , as to leave his estate from his nephew ; —but he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest . mr. dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife and daughters than for himself or his son ; —but to his son , and his son ’ s son , a child of four years old , it was secured , in such a way , as to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear to him , and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate , or by any sale of its valuable woods . the whole was tied up for the benefit of this child , who , in occasional visits with his father and mother at norland , had so far gained on the affections of his uncle , by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three years old ; an imperfect articulation , an earnest desire of having his own way , many cunning tricks , and a great deal of noise , as to outweigh all the value of all the attention which , for years , he had received from his niece and her daughters . he meant not to be unkind , however , and , as a mark of his affection for the three girls , he left them a thousand pounds a-piece .
austen	sense	mr. dashwood ’ s disappointment was , at first , severe ; but his temper was cheerful and sanguine ; and he might reasonably hope to live many years , and by living economically , lay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate already large , and capable of almost immediate improvement . but the fortune , which had been so tardy in coming , was his only one twelvemonth . he survived his uncle no longer ; and ten thousand pounds , including the late legacies , was all that remained for his widow and daughters .
austen	sense	his son was sent for as soon as his danger was known , and to him mr. dashwood recommended , with all the strength and urgency which illness could command , the interest of his mother-in-law and sisters .
austen	sense	mr. john dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the family ; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at such a time , and he promised to do every thing in his power to make them comfortable . his father was rendered easy by such an assurance , and mr. john dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might prudently be in his power to do for them .
austen	sense	he was not an ill-disposed young man , unless to be rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be ill-disposed : but he was , in general , well respected ; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of his ordinary duties . had he married a more amiable woman , he might have been made still more respectable than he was : —he might even have been made amiable himself ; for he was very young when he married , and very fond of his wife . but mrs. john dashwood was a strong caricature of himself ; —more narrow-minded and selfish .
austen	sense	when he gave his promise to his father , he meditated within himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand pounds a-piece . he then really thought himself equal to it . the prospect of four thousand a-year , in addition to his present income , besides the remaining half of his own mother ’ s fortune , warmed his heart , and made him feel capable of generosity . “ yes , he would give them three thousand pounds : it would be liberal and handsome ! it would be enough to make them completely easy . three thousand pounds ! he could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience. ” he thought of it all day long , and for many days successively , and he did not repent .
austen	sense	no sooner was his father ’ s funeral over , than mrs. john dashwood , without sending any notice of her intention to her mother-in-law , arrived with her child and their attendants . no one could dispute her right to come ; the house was her husband ’ s from the moment of his father ’ s decease ; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater , and to a woman in mrs. dashwood ’ s situation , with only common feelings , must have been highly unpleasing ; —but in _her_ mind there was a sense of honor so keen , a generosity so romantic , that any offence of the kind , by whomsoever given or received , was to her a source of immovable disgust . mrs. john dashwood had never been a favourite with any of her husband ’ s family ; but she had had no opportunity , till the present , of showing them with how little attention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion required it .
austen	sense	so acutely did mrs. dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour , and so earnestly did she despise her daughter-in-law for it , that , on the arrival of the latter , she would have quitted the house for ever , had not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the propriety of going , and her own tender love for all her three children determined her afterwards to stay , and for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother .
austen	sense	elinor , this eldest daughter , whose advice was so effectual , possessed a strength of understanding , and coolness of judgment , which qualified her , though only nineteen , to be the counsellor of her mother , and enabled her frequently to counteract , to the advantage of them all , that eagerness of mind in mrs. dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence . she had an excellent heart ; —her disposition was affectionate , and her feelings were strong ; but she knew how to govern them : it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn ; and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught .
austen	sense	marianne ’ s abilities were , in many respects , quite equal to elinor ’ s . she was sensible and clever ; but eager in everything : her sorrows , her joys , could have no moderation . she was generous , amiable , interesting : she was everything but prudent . the resemblance between her and her mother was strikingly great .
austen	sense	elinor saw , with concern , the excess of her sister ’ s sensibility ; but by mrs. dashwood it was valued and cherished . they encouraged each other now in the violence of their affliction . the agony of grief which overpowered them at first , was voluntarily renewed , was sought for , was created again and again . they gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow , seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it , and resolved against ever admitting consolation in future . elinor , too , was deeply afflicted ; but still she could struggle , she could exert herself . she could consult with her brother , could receive her sister-in-law on her arrival , and treat her with proper attention ; and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion , and encourage her to similar forbearance .
austen	sense	margaret , the other sister , was a good-humored , well-disposed girl ; but as she had already imbibed a good deal of marianne ’ s romance , without having much of her sense , she did not , at thirteen , bid fair to equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life .
austen	sense	chapter ii . mrs. john dashwood now installed herself mistress of norland ; and her mother and sisters-in-law were degraded to the condition of visitors . as such , however , they were treated by her with quiet civility ; and by her husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody beyond himself , his wife , and their child . he really pressed them , with some earnestness , to consider norland as their home ; and , as no plan appeared so eligible to mrs. dashwood as remaining there till she could accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood , his invitation was accepted .
austen	sense	a continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former delight , was exactly what suited her mind . in seasons of cheerfulness , no temper could be more cheerful than hers , or possess , in a greater degree , that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness itself . but in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy , and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy .
austen	sense	mrs. john dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intended to do for his sisters . to take three thousand pounds from the fortune of their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the most dreadful degree . she begged him to think again on the subject . how could he answer it to himself to rob his child , and his only child too , of so large a sum ? and what possible claim could the miss dashwoods , who were related to him only by half blood , which she considered as no relationship at all , have on his generosity to so large an amount . it was very well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist between the children of any man by different marriages ; and why was he to ruin himself , and their poor little harry , by giving away all his money to his half sisters ?
austen	sense	“ it was my father ’ s last request to me , ” replied her husband , “ that i should assist his widow and daughters. ” “ he did not know what he was talking of , i dare say ; ten to one but he was light-headed at the time . had he been in his right senses , he could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half your fortune from your own child . ”
austen	sense	“ he did not stipulate for any particular sum , my dear fanny ; he only requested me , in general terms , to assist them , and make their situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do . perhaps it would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself . he could hardly suppose i should neglect them . but as he required the promise , i could not do less than give it ; at least i thought so at the time . the promise , therefore , was given , and must be performed . something must be done for them whenever they leave norland and settle in a new home . ”
austen	sense	“ well , then , _let_ something be done for them ; but _that_ something need not be three thousand pounds . consider , ” she added , “ that when the money is once parted with , it never can return . your sisters will marry , and it will be gone for ever . if , indeed , it could be restored to our poor little boy— ”
austen	sense	“ why , to be sure , ” said her husband , very gravely , “ that would make great difference . the time may come when harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with . if he should have a numerous family , for instance , it would be a very convenient addition . ”
austen	sense	“ to be sure it would. ” “ perhaps , then , it would be better for all parties , if the sum were diminished one half.—five hundred pounds would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes ! ”
austen	sense	“ oh ! beyond anything great ! what brother on earth would do half so much for his sisters , even if _really_ his sisters ! and as it is—only half blood ! —but you have such a generous spirit ! ”
austen	sense	“ i would not wish to do any thing mean , ” he replied . “ one had rather , on such occasions , do too much than too little . no one , at least , can think i have not done enough for them : even themselves , they can hardly expect more . ”
austen	sense	“ there is no knowing what _they_ may expect , ” said the lady , “ but we are not to think of their expectations : the question is , what you can afford to do. ” “ certainly—and i think i may afford to give them five hundred pounds a-piece . as it is , without any addition of mine , they will each have about three thousand pounds on their mother ’ s death—a very comfortable fortune for any young woman . ”
austen	sense	“ to be sure it is ; and , indeed , it strikes me that they can want no addition at all . they will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them . if they marry , they will be sure of doing well , and if they do not , they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten thousand pounds . ”
austen	sense	“ that is very true , and , therefore , i do not know whether , upon the whole , it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother while she lives , rather than for them—something of the annuity kind i mean.—my sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself . a hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable . ”
austen	sense	his wife hesitated a little , however , in giving her consent to this plan . “ to be sure , ” said she , “ it is better than parting with fifteen hundred pounds at once . but , then , if mrs. dashwood should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in . ”
austen	sense	“ fifteen years ! my dear fanny ; her life can not be worth half that purchase. ” “ certainly not ; but if you observe , people always live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them ; and she is very stout and healthy , and hardly forty . an annuity is a very serious business ; it comes over and over every year , and there is no getting rid of it . you are not aware of what you are doing . i have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities ; for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to old superannuated servants by my father ’ s will , and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it . twice every year these annuities were to be paid ; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them ; and then one of them was said to have died , and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing . my mother was quite sick of it . her income was not her own , she said , with such perpetual claims on it ; and it was the more unkind in my father , because , otherwise , the money would have been entirely at my mother ’ s disposal , without any restriction whatever . it has given me such an abhorrence of annuities , that i am sure i would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world . ”
austen	sense	“ it is certainly an unpleasant thing , ” replied mr. dashwood , “ to have those kind of yearly drains on one ’ s income . one ’ s fortune , as your mother justly says , is _not_ one ’ s own . to be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum , on every rent day , is by no means desirable : it takes away one ’ s independence . ”
austen	sense	“ undoubtedly ; and after all you have no thanks for it . they think themselves secure , you do no more than what is expected , and it raises no gratitude at all . if i were you , whatever i did should be done at my own discretion entirely . i would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly . it may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred , or even fifty pounds from our own expenses . ”
austen	sense	“ i believe you are right , my love ; it will be better that there should be no annuity in the case ; whatever i may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance , because they would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income , and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the year . it will certainly be much the best way . a present of fifty pounds , now and then , will prevent their ever being distressed for money , and will , i think , be amply discharging my promise to my father . ”
austen	sense	“ to be sure it will . indeed , to say the truth , i am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all . the assistance he thought of , i dare say , was only such as might be reasonably expected of you ; for instance , such as looking out for a comfortable small house for them , helping them to move their things , and sending them presents of fish and game , and so forth , whenever they are in season . i ’ ll lay my life that he meant nothing farther ; indeed , it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did . do but consider , my dear mr. dashwood , how excessively comfortable your mother-in-law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds , besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls , which brings them in fifty pounds a year a-piece , and , of course , they will pay their mother for their board out of it . altogether , they will have five hundred a-year amongst them , and what on earth can four women want for more than that ? —they will live so cheap ! their housekeeping will be nothing at all . they will have no carriage , no horses , and hardly any servants ; they will keep no company , and can have no expenses of any kind ! only conceive how comfortable they will be ! five hundred a year ! i am sure i can not imagine how they will spend half of it ; and as to your giving them more , it is quite absurd to think of it . they will be much more able to give _you_ something . ”
austen	sense	“ upon my word , ” said mr. dashwood , “ i believe you are perfectly right . my father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than what you say . i clearly understand it now , and i will strictly fulfil my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you have described . when my mother removes into another house my services shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as i can . some little present of furniture too may be acceptable then . ”
austen	sense	“ certainly , ” returned mrs. john dashwood . “ but , however , _one_ thing must be considered . when your father and mother moved to norland , though the furniture of stanhill was sold , all the china , plate , and linen was saved , and is now left to your mother . her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it . ”
austen	sense	“ that is a material consideration undoubtedly . a valuable legacy indeed ! and yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here. ” “ yes ; and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what belongs to this house . a great deal too handsome , in my opinion , for any place _they_ can ever afford to live in . but , however , so it is . your father thought only of _them_ . and i must say this : that you owe no particular gratitude to him , nor attention to his wishes ; for we very well know that if he could , he would have left almost everything in the world to _them_ . ”
austen	sense	this argument was irresistible . it gave to his intentions whatever of decision was wanting before ; and he finally resolved , that it would be absolutely unnecessary , if not highly indecorous , to do more for the widow and children of his father , than such kind of neighbourly acts as his own wife pointed out .
austen	sense	chapter iii . mrs. dashwood remained at norland several months ; not from any disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while ; for when her spirits began to revive , and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances , she was impatient to be gone , and indefatigable in her inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of norland ; for to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible . but she could hear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and ease , and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter , whose steadier judgment rejected several houses as too large for their income , which her mother would have approved .
austen	sense	mrs. dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise on the part of his son in their favour , which gave comfort to his last earthly reflections . she doubted the sincerity of this assurance no more than he had doubted it himself , and she thought of it for her daughters ’ sake with satisfaction , though as for herself she was persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000£ would support her in affluence . for their brother ’ s sake , too , for the sake of his own heart , she rejoiced ; and she reproached herself for being unjust to his merit before , in believing him incapable of generosity . his attentive behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that their welfare was dear to him , and , for a long time , she firmly relied on the liberality of his intentions .
austen	sense	the contempt which she had , very early in their acquaintance , felt for her daughter-in-law , was very much increased by the farther knowledge of her character , which half a year ’ s residence in her family afforded ; and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal affection on the side of the former , the two ladies might have found it impossible to have lived together so long , had not a particular circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility , according to the opinions of mrs. dashwood , to her daughters ’ continuance at norland .
austen	sense	this circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl and the brother of mrs. john dashwood , a gentleman-like and pleasing young man , who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sister ’ s establishment at norland , and who had since spent the greatest part of his time there .
austen	sense	some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of interest , for edward ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had died very rich ; and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence , for , except a trifling sum , the whole of his fortune depended on the will of his mother . but mrs. dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either consideration . it was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable , that he loved her daughter , and that elinor returned the partiality . it was contrary to every doctrine of hers that difference of fortune should keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of disposition ; and that elinor ’ s merit should not be acknowledged by every one who knew her , was to her comprehension impossible .
austen	sense	edward ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by any peculiar graces of person or address . he was not handsome , and his manners required intimacy to make them pleasing . he was too diffident to do justice to himself ; but when his natural shyness was overcome , his behaviour gave every indication of an open , affectionate heart . his understanding was good , and his education had given it solid improvement . but he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to answer the wishes of his mother and sister , who longed to see him distinguished—as—they hardly knew what . they wanted him to make a fine figure in the world in some manner or other . his mother wished to interest him in political concerns , to get him into parliament , or to see him connected with some of the great men of the day . mrs. john dashwood wished it likewise ; but in the mean while , till one of these superior blessings could be attained , it would have quieted her ambition to see him driving a barouche . but edward had no turn for great men or barouches . all his wishes centered in domestic comfort and the quiet of private life . fortunately he had a younger brother who was more promising .
austen	sense	edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engaged much of mrs. dashwood ’ s attention ; for she was , at that time , in such affliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects . she saw only that he was quiet and unobtrusive , and she liked him for it . he did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill-timed conversation . she was first called to observe and approve him farther , by a reflection which elinor chanced one day to make on the difference between him and his sister . it was a contrast which recommended him most forcibly to her mother .
austen	sense	“ it is enough , ” said she ; “ to say that he is unlike fanny is enough . it implies everything amiable . i love him already. ” “ i think you will like him , ” said elinor , “ when you know more of him . ”
austen	sense	“ like him ! ” replied her mother with a smile . “ i feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love. ” “ you may esteem him. ” “ i have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love . ”
austen	sense	mrs. dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him . her manners were attaching , and soon banished his reserve . she speedily comprehended all his merits ; the persuasion of his regard for elinor perhaps assisted her penetration ; but she really felt assured of his worth : and even that quietness of manner , which militated against all her established ideas of what a young man ’ s address ought to be , was no longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his temper affectionate .
austen	sense	no sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour to elinor , than she considered their serious attachment as certain , and looked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching .
austen	sense	“ in a few months , my dear marianne , ” said she , “ elinor will , in all probability be settled for life . we shall miss her ; but _she_ will be happy. ” “ oh ! mama , how shall we do without her ? ”
austen	sense	“ my love , it will be scarcely a separation . we shall live within a few miles of each other , and shall meet every day of our lives . you will gain a brother , a real , affectionate brother . i have the highest opinion in the world of edward ’ s heart . but you look grave , marianne ; do you disapprove your sister ’ s choice ? ”
austen	sense	“ perhaps , ” said marianne , “ i may consider it with some surprise . edward is very amiable , and i love him tenderly . but yet—he is not the kind of young man—there is something wanting—his figure is not striking ; it has none of that grace which i should expect in the man who could seriously attach my sister . his eyes want all that spirit , that fire , which at once announce virtue and intelligence . and besides all this , i am afraid , mama , he has no real taste . music seems scarcely to attract him , and though he admires elinor ’ s drawings very much , it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their worth . it is evident , in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws , that in fact he knows nothing of the matter . he admires as a lover , not as a connoisseur . to satisfy me , those characters must be united . i could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point coincide with my own . he must enter into all my feelings ; the same books , the same music must charm us both . oh ! mama , how spiritless , how tame was edward ’ s manner in reading to us last night ! i felt for my sister most severely . yet she bore it with so much composure , she seemed scarcely to notice it . i could hardly keep my seat . to hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild , pronounced with such impenetrable calmness , such dreadful indifference ! ”
austen	sense	“ he would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose . i thought so at the time ; but you _would_ give him cowper. ” “ nay , mama , if he is not to be animated by cowper ! —but we must allow for difference of taste . elinor has not my feelings , and therefore she may overlook it , and be happy with him . but it would have broke _my_ heart , had i loved him , to hear him read with so little sensibility . mama , the more i know of the world , the more am i convinced that i shall never see a man whom i can really love . i require so much ! he must have all edward ’ s virtues , and his person and manners must ornament his goodness with every possible charm . ”
austen	sense	“ remember , my love , that you are not seventeen . it is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness . why should you be less fortunate than your mother ? in one circumstance only , my marianne , may your destiny be different from hers ! ”
austen	sense	chapter iv . “ what a pity it is , elinor , ” said marianne , “ that edward should have no taste for drawing. ” “ no taste for drawing ! ” replied elinor , “ why should you think so ? he does not draw himself , indeed , but he has great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people , and i assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste , though he has not had opportunities of improving it . had he ever been in the way of learning , i think he would have drawn very well . he distrusts his own judgment in such matters so much , that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any picture ; but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste , which in general direct him perfectly right . ”
austen	sense	marianne was afraid of offending , and said no more on the subject ; but the kind of approbation which elinor described as excited in him by the drawings of other people , was very far from that rapturous delight , which , in her opinion , could alone be called taste . yet , though smiling within herself at the mistake , she honoured her sister for that blind partiality to edward which produced it .
austen	sense	“ i hope , marianne , ” continued elinor , “ you do not consider him as deficient in general taste . indeed , i think i may say that you can not , for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial , and if _that_ were your opinion , i am sure you could never be civil to him . ”
austen	sense	marianne hardly knew what to say . she would not wound the feelings of her sister on any account , and yet to say what she did not believe was impossible . at length she replied :
austen	sense	“ do not be offended , elinor , if my praise of him is not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits . i have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind , his inclinations and tastes , as you have ; but i have the highest opinion in the world of his goodness and sense . i think him every thing that is worthy and amiable . ”
austen	sense	“ i am sure , ” replied elinor , with a smile , “ that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that . i do not perceive how you could express yourself more warmly . ”
austen	sense	marianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased . “ of his sense and his goodness , ” continued elinor , “ no one can , i think , be in doubt , who has seen him often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation . the excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent . you know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth . but of his minuter propensities , as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself . he and i have been at times thrown a good deal together , while you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother . i have seen a great deal of him , have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on subjects of literature and taste ; and , upon the whole , i venture to pronounce that his mind is well-informed , enjoyment of books exceedingly great , his imagination lively , his observation just and correct , and his taste delicate and pure . his abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person . at first sight , his address is certainly not striking ; and his person can hardly be called handsome , till the expression of his eyes , which are uncommonly good , and the general sweetness of his countenance , is perceived . at present , i know him so well , that i think him really handsome ; or at least , almost so . what say you , marianne ? ”
austen	sense	“ i shall very soon think him handsome , elinor , if i do not now . when you tell me to love him as a brother , i shall no more see imperfection in his face , than i now do in his heart . ”
austen	sense	elinor started at this declaration , and was sorry for the warmth she had been betrayed into , in speaking of him . she felt that edward stood very high in her opinion . she believed the regard to be mutual ; but she required greater certainty of it to make marianne ’ s conviction of their attachment agreeable to her . she knew that what marianne and her mother conjectured one moment , they believed the next—that with them , to wish was to hope , and to hope was to expect . she tried to explain the real state of the case to her sister .
austen	sense	“ i do not attempt to deny , ” said she , “ that i think very highly of him—that i greatly esteem , that i like him. ” marianne here burst forth with indignation— “ esteem him ! like him ! cold-hearted elinor ! oh ! worse than cold-hearted ! ashamed of being otherwise . use those words again , and i will leave the room this moment . ”
austen	sense	elinor could not help laughing . “ excuse me , ” said she ; “ and be assured that i meant no offence to you , by speaking , in so quiet a way , of my own feelings . believe them to be stronger than i have declared ; believe them , in short , to be such as his merit , and the suspicion—the hope of his affection for me may warrant , without imprudence or folly . but farther than this you must _not_ believe . i am by no means assured of his regard for me . there are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful ; and till his sentiments are fully known , you can not wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality , by believing or calling it more than it is . in my heart i feel little—scarcely any doubt of his preference . but there are other points to be considered besides his inclination . he is very far from being independent . what his mother really is we can not know ; but , from fanny ’ s occasional mention of her conduct and opinions , we have never been disposed to think her amiable ; and i am very much mistaken if edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way , if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank . ”
austen	sense	marianne was astonished to find how much the imagination of her mother and herself had outstripped the truth . “ and you really are not engaged to him ! ” said she . “ yet it certainly soon will happen . but two advantages will proceed from this delay . _i_ shall not lose you so soon , and edward will have greater opportunity of improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity . oh ! if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself , how delightful it would be ! ”
austen	sense	elinor had given her real opinion to her sister . she could not consider her partiality for edward in so prosperous a state as marianne had believed it . there was , at times , a want of spirits about him which , if it did not denote indifference , spoke of something almost as unpromising . a doubt of her regard , supposing him to feel it , need not give him more than inquietude . it would not be likely to produce that dejection of mind which frequently attended him . a more reasonable cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the indulgence of his affection . she knew that his mother neither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable at present , nor to give him any assurance that he might form a home for himself , without strictly attending to her views for his aggrandizement . with such a knowledge as this , it was impossible for elinor to feel easy on the subject . she was far from depending on that result of his preference of her , which her mother and sister still considered as certain . nay , the longer they were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard ; and sometimes , for a few painful minutes , she believed it to be no more than friendship .
austen	sense	but , whatever might really be its limits , it was enough , when perceived by his sister , to make her uneasy , and at the same time , ( which was still more common , ) to make her uncivil . she took the first opportunity of affronting her mother-in-law on the occasion , talking to her so expressively of her brother ’ s great expectations , of mrs. ferrars ’ s resolution that both her sons should marry well , and of the danger attending any young woman who attempted to _draw him in ; _ that mrs. dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious , nor endeavor to be calm . she gave her an answer which marked her contempt , and instantly left the room , resolving that , whatever might be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal , her beloved elinor should not be exposed another week to such insinuations .
austen	sense	in this state of her spirits , a letter was delivered to her from the post , which contained a proposal particularly well timed . it was the offer of a small house , on very easy terms , belonging to a relation of her own , a gentleman of consequence and property in devonshire . the letter was from this gentleman himself , and written in the true spirit of friendly accommodation . he understood that she was in need of a dwelling ; and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage , he assured her that everything should be done to it which she might think necessary , if the situation pleased her . he earnestly pressed her , after giving the particulars of the house and garden , to come with her daughters to barton park , the place of his own residence , from whence she might judge , herself , whether barton cottage , for the houses were in the same parish , could , by any alteration , be made comfortable to her . he seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole of his letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure to his cousin ; more especially at a moment when she was suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearer connections . she needed no time for deliberation or inquiry . her resolution was formed as she read . the situation of barton , in a county so far distant from sussex as devonshire , which , but a few hours before , would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every possible advantage belonging to the place , was now its first recommendation . to quit the neighbourhood of norland was no longer an evil ; it was an object of desire ; it was a blessing , in comparison of the misery of continuing her daughter-in-law ’ s guest ; and to remove for ever from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit or visit it while such a woman was its mistress . she instantly wrote sir john middleton her acknowledgment of his kindness , and her acceptance of his proposal ; and then hastened to show both letters to her daughters , that she might be secure of their approbation before her answer were sent .
austen	sense	elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle at some distance from norland , than immediately amongst their present acquaintance . on _that_ head , therefore , it was not for her to oppose her mother ’ s intention of removing into devonshire . the house , too , as described by sir john , was on so simple a scale , and the rent so uncommonly moderate , as to leave her no right of objection on either point ; and , therefore , though it was not a plan which brought any charm to her fancy , though it was a removal from the vicinity of norland beyond her wishes , she made no attempt to dissuade her mother from sending a letter of acquiescence .
austen	sense	chapter v. no sooner was her answer dispatched , than mrs. dashwood indulged herself in the pleasure of announcing to her son-in-law and his wife that she was provided with a house , and should incommode them no longer than till every thing were ready for her inhabiting it . they heard her with surprise . mrs. john dashwood said nothing ; but her husband civilly hoped that she would not be settled far from norland . she had great satisfaction in replying that she was going into devonshire.—edward turned hastily towards her , on hearing this , and , in a voice of surprise and concern , which required no explanation to her , repeated , “ devonshire ! are you , indeed , going there ? so far from hence ! and to what part of it ? ” she explained the situation . it was within four miles northward of exeter .
austen	sense	“ it is but a cottage , ” she continued , “ but i hope to see many of my friends in it . a room or two can easily be added ; and if my friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me , i am sure i will find none in accommodating them . ”
austen	sense	she concluded with a very kind invitation to mr. and mrs. john dashwood to visit her at barton ; and to edward she gave one with still greater affection . though her late conversation with her daughter-in-law had made her resolve on remaining at norland no longer than was unavoidable , it had not produced the smallest effect on her in that point to which it principally tended . to separate edward and elinor was as far from being her object as ever ; and she wished to show mrs. john dashwood , by this pointed invitation to her brother , how totally she disregarded her disapprobation of the match .
austen	sense	mr. john dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from norland as to prevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture . he really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion ; for the very exertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.—the furniture was all sent around by water . it chiefly consisted of household linen , plate , china , and books , with a handsome pianoforte of marianne ’ s . mrs. john dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh : she could not help feeling it hard that as mrs. dashwood ’ s income would be so trifling in comparison with their own , she should have any handsome article of furniture .
austen	sense	mrs. dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth ; it was ready furnished , and she might have immediate possession . no difficulty arose on either side in the agreement ; and she waited only for the disposal of her effects at norland , and to determine her future household , before she set off for the west ; and this , as she was exceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested her , was soon done.—the horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his death , and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage , she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest daughter . for the comfort of her children , had she consulted only her own wishes , she would have kept it ; but the discretion of elinor prevailed . _her_ wisdom too limited the number of their servants to three ; two maids and a man , with whom they were speedily provided from amongst those who had formed their establishment at norland .
austen	sense	the man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into devonshire , to prepare the house for their mistress ’ s arrival ; for as lady middleton was entirely unknown to mrs. dashwood , she preferred going directly to the cottage to being a visitor at barton park ; and she relied so undoubtingly on sir john ’ s description of the house , as to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own . her eagerness to be gone from norland was preserved from diminution by the evident satisfaction of her daughter-in-law in the prospect of her removal ; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure . now was the time when her son-in-law ’ s promise to his father might with particular propriety be fulfilled . since he had neglected to do it on first coming to the estate , their quitting his house might be looked on as the most suitable period for its accomplishment . but mrs. dashwood began shortly to give over every hope of the kind , and to be convinced , from the general drift of his discourse , that his assistance extended no farther than their maintenance for six months at norland . he so frequently talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping , and of the perpetual demands upon his purse , which a man of any consequence in the world was beyond calculation exposed to , that he seemed rather to stand in need of more money himself than to have any design of giving money away .
austen	sense	in a very few weeks from the day which brought sir john middleton ’ s first letter to norland , every thing was so far settled in their future abode as to enable mrs. dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey .
austen	sense	many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so much beloved . “ dear , dear norland ! ” said marianne , as she wandered alone before the house , on the last evening of their being there ; “ when shall i cease to regret you ! —when learn to feel a home elsewhere ! —oh ! happy house , could you know what i suffer in now viewing you from this spot , from whence perhaps i may view you no more ! —and you , ye well-known trees ! —but you will continue the same.—no leaf will decay because we are removed , nor any branch become motionless although we can observe you no longer ! —no ; you will continue the same ; unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion , and insensible of any change in those who walk under your shade ! —but who will remain to enjoy you ? ”
austen	sense	chapter vi . the first part of their journey was performed in too melancholy a disposition to be otherwise than tedious and unpleasant . but as they drew towards the end of it , their interest in the appearance of a country which they were to inhabit overcame their dejection , and a view of barton valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness . it was a pleasant fertile spot , well wooded , and rich in pasture . after winding along it for more than a mile , they reached their own house . a small green court was the whole of its demesne in front ; and a neat wicket gate admitted them into it .
austen	sense	as a house , barton cottage , though small , was comfortable and compact ; but as a cottage it was defective , for the building was regular , the roof was tiled , the window shutters were not painted green , nor were the walls covered with honeysuckles . a narrow passage led directly through the house into the garden behind . on each side of the entrance was a sitting room , about sixteen feet square ; and beyond them were the offices and the stairs . four bed-rooms and two garrets formed the rest of the house . it had not been built many years and was in good repair . in comparison of norland , it was poor and small indeed ! —but the tears which recollection called forth as they entered the house were soon dried away . they were cheered by the joy of the servants on their arrival , and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy . it was very early in september ; the season was fine , and from first seeing the place under the advantage of good weather , they received an impression in its favour which was of material service in recommending it to their lasting approbation .
austen	sense	the situation of the house was good . high hills rose immediately behind , and at no great distance on each side ; some of which were open downs , the others cultivated and woody . the village of barton was chiefly on one of these hills , and formed a pleasant view from the cottage windows . the prospect in front was more extensive ; it commanded the whole of the valley , and reached into the country beyond . the hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley in that direction ; under another name , and in another course , it branched out again between two of the steepest of them .
austen	sense	with the size and furniture of the house mrs. dashwood was upon the whole well satisfied ; for though her former style of life rendered many additions to the latter indispensable , yet to add and improve was a delight to her ; and she had at this time ready money enough to supply all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments . “ as for the house itself , to be sure , ” said she , “ it is too small for our family , but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present , as it is too late in the year for improvements . perhaps in the spring , if i have plenty of money , as i dare say i shall , we may think about building . these parlors are both too small for such parties of our friends as i hope to see often collected here ; and i have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other , and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance ; this , with a new drawing room which may be easily added , and a bed-chamber and garret above , will make it a very snug little cottage . i could wish the stairs were handsome . but one must not expect every thing ; though i suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them . i shall see how much i am before-hand with the world in the spring , and we will plan our improvements accordingly . ”
austen	sense	in the mean time , till all these alterations could be made from the savings of an income of five hundred a-year by a woman who never saved in her life , they were wise enough to be contented with the house as it was ; and each of them was busy in arranging their particular concerns , and endeavoring , by placing around them books and other possessions , to form themselves a home . marianne ’ s pianoforte was unpacked and properly disposed of ; and elinor ’ s drawings were affixed to the walls of their sitting room .
austen	sense	in such employments as these they were interrupted soon after breakfast the next day by the entrance of their landlord , who called to welcome them to barton , and to offer them every accommodation from his own house and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient . sir john middleton was a good looking man about forty . he had formerly visited at stanhill , but it was too long for his young cousins to remember him . his countenance was thoroughly good-humoured ; and his manners were as friendly as the style of his letter . their arrival seemed to afford him real satisfaction , and their comfort to be an object of real solicitude to him . he said much of his earnest desire of their living in the most sociable terms with his family , and pressed them so cordially to dine at barton park every day till they were better settled at home , that , though his entreaties were carried to a point of perseverance beyond civility , they could not give offence . his kindness was not confined to words ; for within an hour after he left them , a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park , which was followed before the end of the day by a present of game . he insisted , moreover , on conveying all their letters to and from the post for them , and would not be denied the satisfaction of sending them his newspaper every day .
austen	sense	lady middleton had sent a very civil message by him , denoting her intention of waiting on mrs. dashwood as soon as she could be assured that her visit would be no inconvenience ; and as this message was answered by an invitation equally polite , her ladyship was introduced to them the next day .
austen	sense	they were , of course , very anxious to see a person on whom so much of their comfort at barton must depend ; and the elegance of her appearance was favourable to their wishes . lady middleton was not more than six or seven and twenty ; her face was handsome , her figure tall and striking , and her address graceful . her manners had all the elegance which her husband ’ s wanted . but they would have been improved by some share of his frankness and warmth ; and her visit was long enough to detract something from their first admiration , by showing that , though perfectly well-bred , she was reserved , cold , and had nothing to say for herself beyond the most common-place inquiry or remark .
austen	sense	conversation however was not wanted , for sir john was very chatty , and lady middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her their eldest child , a fine little boy about six years old , by which means there was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case of extremity , for they had to enquire his name and age , admire his beauty , and ask him questions which his mother answered for him , while he hung about her and held down his head , to the great surprise of her ladyship , who wondered at his being so shy before company , as he could make noise enough at home . on every formal visit a child ought to be of the party , by way of provision for discourse . in the present case it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his father or mother , and in what particular he resembled either , for of course every body differed , and every body was astonished at the opinion of the others .
austen	sense	an opportunity was soon to be given to the dashwoods of debating on the rest of the children , as sir john would not leave the house without securing their promise of dining at the park the next day .
austen	sense	chapter vii . barton park was about half a mile from the cottage . the ladies had passed near it in their way along the valley , but it was screened from their view at home by the projection of a hill . the house was large and handsome ; and the middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality and elegance . the former was for sir john ’ s gratification , the latter for that of his lady . they were scarcely ever without some friends staying with them in the house , and they kept more company of every kind than any other family in the neighbourhood . it was necessary to the happiness of both ; for however dissimilar in temper and outward behaviour , they strongly resembled each other in that total want of talent and taste which confined their employments , unconnected with such as society produced , within a very narrow compass . sir john was a sportsman , lady middleton a mother . he hunted and shot , and she humoured her children ; and these were their only resources . lady middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the year round , while sir john ’ s independent employments were in existence only half the time . continual engagements at home and abroad , however , supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education ; supported the good spirits of sir john , and gave exercise to the good breeding of his wife .
austen	sense	lady middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table , and of all her domestic arrangements ; and from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment in any of their parties . but sir john ’ s satisfaction in society was much more real ; he delighted in collecting about him more young people than his house would hold , and the noisier they were the better was he pleased . he was a blessing to all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood , for in summer he was for ever forming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors , and in winter his private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not suffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen .
austen	sense	the arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy to him , and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his cottage at barton . the miss dashwoods were young , pretty , and unaffected . it was enough to secure his good opinion ; for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want to make her mind as captivating as her person . the friendliness of his disposition made him happy in accommodating those , whose situation might be considered , in comparison with the past , as unfortunate . in showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction of a good heart ; and in settling a family of females only in his cottage , he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman ; for a sportsman , though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise , is not often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own manor .
austen	sense	mrs. dashwood and her daughters were met at the door of the house by sir john , who welcomed them to barton park with unaffected sincerity ; and as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the young ladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the day before , at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them . they would see , he said , only one gentleman there besides himself ; a particular friend who was staying at the park , but who was neither very young nor very gay . he hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the party , and could assure them it should never happen so again . he had been to several families that morning in hopes of procuring some addition to their number , but it was moonlight and every body was full of engagements . luckily lady middleton ’ s mother had arrived at barton within the last hour , and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman , he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might imagine . the young ladies , as well as their mother , were perfectly satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party , and wished for no more .
austen	sense	mrs. jennings , lady middleton ’ s mother , was a good-humoured , merry , fat , elderly woman , who talked a great deal , seemed very happy , and rather vulgar . she was full of jokes and laughter , and before dinner was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands ; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in sussex , and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not . marianne was vexed at it for her sister ’ s sake , and turned her eyes towards elinor to see how she bore these attacks , with an earnestness which gave elinor far more pain than could arise from such common-place raillery as mrs. jennings ’ s .
austen	sense	colonel brandon , the friend of sir john , seemed no more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend , than lady middleton was to be his wife , or mrs. jennings to be lady middleton ’ s mother . he was silent and grave . his appearance however was not unpleasing , in spite of his being in the opinion of marianne and margaret an absolute old bachelor , for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty ; but though his face was not handsome , his countenance was sensible , and his address was particularly gentlemanlike .
austen	sense	there was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as companions to the dashwoods ; but the cold insipidity of lady middleton was so particularly repulsive , that in comparison of it the gravity of colonel brandon , and even the boisterous mirth of sir john and his mother-in-law was interesting . lady middleton seemed to be roused to enjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after dinner , who pulled her about , tore her clothes , and put an end to every kind of discourse except what related to themselves .
austen	sense	in the evening , as marianne was discovered to be musical , she was invited to play . the instrument was unlocked , every body prepared to be charmed , and marianne , who sang very well , at their request went through the chief of the songs which lady middleton had brought into the family on her marriage , and which perhaps had lain ever since in the same position on the pianoforte , for her ladyship had celebrated that event by giving up music , although by her mother ’ s account , she had played extremely well , and by her own was very fond of it .
austen	sense	marianne ’ s performance was highly applauded . sir john was loud in his admiration at the end of every song , and as loud in his conversation with the others while every song lasted . lady middleton frequently called him to order , wondered how any one ’ s attention could be diverted from music for a moment , and asked marianne to sing a particular song which marianne had just finished . colonel brandon alone , of all the party , heard her without being in raptures . he paid her only the compliment of attention ; and she felt a respect for him on the occasion , which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste . his pleasure in music , though it amounted not to that ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own , was estimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of the others ; and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five and thirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite power of enjoyment . she was perfectly disposed to make every allowance for the colonel ’ s advanced state of life which humanity required .
austen	sense	chapter viii . mrs. jennings was a widow with an ample jointure . she had only two daughters , both of whom she had lived to see respectably married , and she had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the world . in the promotion of this object she was zealously active , as far as her ability reached ; and missed no opportunity of projecting weddings among all the young people of her acquaintance . she was remarkably quick in the discovery of attachments , and had enjoyed the advantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady by insinuations of her power over such a young man ; and this kind of discernment enabled her soon after her arrival at barton decisively to pronounce that colonel brandon was very much in love with marianne dashwood . she rather suspected it to be so , on the very first evening of their being together , from his listening so attentively while she sang to them ; and when the visit was returned by the middletons ’ dining at the cottage , the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again . it must be so . she was perfectly convinced of it . it would be an excellent match , for _he_ was rich , and _she_ was handsome . mrs. jennings had been anxious to see colonel brandon well married , ever since her connection with sir john first brought him to her knowledge ; and she was always anxious to get a good husband for every pretty girl .
austen	sense	the immediate advantage to herself was by no means inconsiderable , for it supplied her with endless jokes against them both . at the park she laughed at the colonel , and in the cottage at marianne . to the former her raillery was probably , as far as it regarded only himself , perfectly indifferent ; but to the latter it was at first incomprehensible ; and when its object was understood , she hardly knew whether most to laugh at its absurdity , or censure its impertinence , for she considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonel ’ s advanced years , and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor .
austen	sense	mrs. dashwood , who could not think a man five years younger than herself , so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy of her daughter , ventured to clear mrs. jennings from the probability of wishing to throw ridicule on his age .
austen	sense	“ but at least , mama , you can not deny the absurdity of the accusation , though you may not think it intentionally ill-natured . colonel brandon is certainly younger than mrs. jennings , but he is old enough to be _my_ father ; and if he were ever animated enough to be in love , must have long outlived every sensation of the kind . it is too ridiculous ! when is a man to be safe from such wit , if age and infirmity will not protect him ? ”
austen	sense	“ infirmity ! ” said elinor , “ do you call colonel brandon infirm ? i can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother ; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs ! ”
austen	sense	“ did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism ? and is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life ? ” “ my dearest child , ” said her mother , laughing , “ at this rate you must be in continual terror of _my_ decay ; and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty . ”
austen	sense	“ mama , you are not doing me justice . i know very well that colonel brandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature . he may live twenty years longer . but thirty-five has nothing to do with matrimony . ”
austen	sense	“ perhaps , ” said elinor , “ thirty-five and seventeen had better not have any thing to do with matrimony together . but if there should by any chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty , i should not think colonel brandon ’ s being thirty-five any objection to his marrying _her_ . ”
austen	sense	“ a woman of seven and twenty , ” said marianne , after pausing a moment , “ can never hope to feel or inspire affection again , and if her home be uncomfortable , or her fortune small , i can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse , for the sake of the provision and security of a wife . in his marrying such a woman therefore there would be nothing unsuitable . it would be a compact of convenience , and the world would be satisfied . in my eyes it would be no marriage at all , but that would be nothing . to me it would seem only a commercial exchange , in which each wished to be benefited at the expense of the other . ”
austen	sense	“ it would be impossible , i know , ” replied elinor , “ to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty-five anything near enough to love , to make him a desirable companion to her . but i must object to your dooming colonel brandon and his wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber , merely because he chanced to complain yesterday ( a very cold damp day ) of a slight rheumatic feel in one of his shoulders . ”
austen	sense	“ but he talked of flannel waistcoats , ” said marianne ; “ and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches , cramps , rheumatisms , and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and the feeble . ”
austen	sense	“ had he been only in a violent fever , you would not have despised him half so much . confess , marianne , is not there something interesting to you in the flushed cheek , hollow eye , and quick pulse of a fever ? ”
austen	sense	soon after this , upon elinor ’ s leaving the room , “ mama , ” said marianne , “ i have an alarm on the subject of illness which i can not conceal from you . i am sure edward ferrars is not well . we have now been here almost a fortnight , and yet he does not come . nothing but real indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay . what else can detain him at norland ? ”
austen	sense	“ had you any idea of his coming so soon ? ” said mrs. dashwood . “ _i_ had none . on the contrary , if i have felt any anxiety at all on the subject , it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation , when i talked of his coming to barton . does elinor expect him already ? ”
austen	sense	“ i have never mentioned it to her , but of course she must. ” “ i rather think you are mistaken , for when i was talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber , she observed that there was no immediate hurry for it , as it was not likely that the room would be wanted for some time . ”
austen	sense	“ how strange this is ! what can be the meaning of it ! but the whole of their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable ! how cold , how composed were their last adieus ! how languid their conversation the last evening of their being together ! in edward ’ s farewell there was no distinction between elinor and me : it was the good wishes of an affectionate brother to both . twice did i leave them purposely together in the course of the last morning , and each time did he most unaccountably follow me out of the room . and elinor , in quitting norland and edward , cried not as i did . even now her self-command is invariable . when is she dejected or melancholy ? when does she try to avoid society , or appear restless and dissatisfied in it ? ”
austen	sense	chapter ix . the dashwoods were now settled at barton with tolerable comfort to themselves . the house and the garden , with all the objects surrounding them , were now become familiar , and the ordinary pursuits which had given to norland half its charms were engaged in again with far greater enjoyment than norland had been able to afford , since the loss of their father . sir john middleton , who called on them every day for the first fortnight , and who was not in the habit of seeing much occupation at home , could not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed .
austen	sense	their visitors , except those from barton park , were not many ; for , in spite of sir john ’ s urgent entreaties that they would mix more in the neighbourhood , and repeated assurances of his carriage being always at their service , the independence of mrs. dashwood ’ s spirit overcame the wish of society for her children ; and she was resolute in declining to visit any family beyond the distance of a walk . there were but few who could be so classed ; and it was not all of them that were attainable . about a mile and a half from the cottage , along the narrow winding valley of allenham , which issued from that of barton , as formerly described , the girls had , in one of their earliest walks , discovered an ancient respectable looking mansion which , by reminding them a little of norland , interested their imagination and made them wish to be better acquainted with it . but they learnt , on enquiry , that its possessor , an elderly lady of very good character , was unfortunately too infirm to mix with the world , and never stirred from home .
austen	sense	the whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks . the high downs which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to seek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits , were a happy alternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their superior beauties ; and towards one of these hills did marianne and margaret one memorable morning direct their steps , attracted by the partial sunshine of a showery sky , and unable longer to bear the confinement which the settled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned . the weather was not tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and their book , in spite of marianne ’ s declaration that the day would be lastingly fair , and that every threatening cloud would be drawn off from their hills ; and the two girls set off together .
austen	sense	they gaily ascended the downs , rejoicing in their own penetration at every glimpse of blue sky ; and when they caught in their faces the animating gales of a high south-westerly wind , they pitied the fears which had prevented their mother and elinor from sharing such delightful sensations .
austen	sense	“ is there a felicity in the world , ” said marianne , “ superior to this ? —margaret , we will walk here at least two hours. ” margaret agreed , and they pursued their way against the wind , resisting it with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer , when suddenly the clouds united over their heads , and a driving rain set full in their face . chagrined and surprised , they were obliged , though unwillingly , to turn back , for no shelter was nearer than their own house . one consolation however remained for them , to which the exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety , —it was that of running with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which led immediately to their garden gate .
austen	sense	they set off . marianne had at first the advantage , but a false step brought her suddenly to the ground ; and margaret , unable to stop herself to assist her , was involuntarily hurried along , and reached the bottom in safety .
austen	sense	a gentleman carrying a gun , with two pointers playing round him , was passing up the hill and within a few yards of marianne , when her accident happened . he put down his gun and ran to her assistance . she had raised herself from the ground , but her foot had been twisted in her fall , and she was scarcely able to stand . the gentleman offered his services ; and perceiving that her modesty declined what her situation rendered necessary , took her up in his arms without farther delay , and carried her down the hill . then passing through the garden , the gate of which had been left open by margaret , he bore her directly into the house , whither margaret was just arrived , and quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour .
austen	sense	elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance , and while the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration which equally sprung from his appearance , he apologized for his intrusion by relating its cause , in a manner so frank and so graceful that his person , which was uncommonly handsome , received additional charms from his voice and expression . had he been even old , ugly , and vulgar , the gratitude and kindness of mrs. dashwood would have been secured by any act of attention to her child ; but the influence of youth , beauty , and elegance , gave an interest to the action which came home to her feelings .
austen	sense	she thanked him again and again ; and , with a sweetness of address which always attended her , invited him to be seated . but this he declined , as he was dirty and wet . mrs. dashwood then begged to know to whom she was obliged . his name , he replied , was willoughby , and his present home was at allenham , from whence he hoped she would allow him the honour of calling tomorrow to enquire after miss dashwood . the honour was readily granted , and he then departed , to make himself still more interesting , in the midst of a heavy rain .
austen	sense	his manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly the theme of general admiration , and the laugh which his gallantry raised against marianne received particular spirit from his exterior attractions . marianne herself had seen less of his person than the rest , for the confusion which crimsoned over her face , on his lifting her up , had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their entering the house . but she had seen enough of him to join in all the admiration of the others , and with an energy which always adorned her praise . his person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn for the hero of a favourite story ; and in his carrying her into the house with so little previous formality , there was a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended the action to her . every circumstance belonging to him was interesting . his name was good , his residence was in their favourite village , and she soon found out that of all manly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most becoming . her imagination was busy , her reflections were pleasant , and the pain of a sprained ankle was disregarded .
austen	sense	sir john called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather that morning allowed him to get out of doors ; and marianne ’ s accident being related to him , he was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman of the name of willoughby at allenham .
austen	sense	“ willoughby ! ” cried sir john ; “ what , is _he_ in the country ? that is good news however ; i will ride over tomorrow , and ask him to dinner on thursday. ” “ you know him then , ” said mrs. dashwood .
austen	sense	“ know him ! to be sure i do . why , he is down here every year. ” “ and what sort of a young man is he ? ” “ as good a kind of fellow as ever lived , i assure you . a very decent shot , and there is not a bolder rider in england . ”
austen	sense	“ and is _that_ all you can say for him ? ” cried marianne , indignantly . “ but what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance ? what his pursuits , his talents , and genius ? ” sir john was rather puzzled .
austen	sense	“ upon my soul , ” said he , “ i do not know much about him as to all _that_ . but he is a pleasant , good humoured fellow , and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer i ever saw . was she out with him today ? ”
austen	sense	but marianne could no more satisfy him as to the colour of mr. willoughby ’ s pointer , than he could describe to her the shades of his mind . “ but who is he ? ” said elinor . “ where does he come from ? has he a house at allenham ? ”
austen	sense	on this point sir john could give more certain intelligence ; and he told them that mr. willoughby had no property of his own in the country ; that he resided there only while he was visiting the old lady at allenham court , to whom he was related , and whose possessions he was to inherit ; adding , “ yes , yes , he is very well worth catching i can tell you , miss dashwood ; he has a pretty little estate of his own in somersetshire besides ; and if i were you , i would not give him up to my younger sister , in spite of all this tumbling down hills . miss marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself . brandon will be jealous , if she does not take care . ”
austen	sense	“ i do not believe , ” said mrs. dashwood , with a good humoured smile , “ that mr. willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of _my_ daughters towards what you call _catching him_ . it is not an employment to which they have been brought up . men are very safe with us , let them be ever so rich . i am glad to find , however , from what you say , that he is a respectable young man , and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible . ”
austen	sense	“ he is as good a sort of fellow , i believe , as ever lived , ” repeated sir john . “ i remember last christmas at a little hop at the park , he danced from eight o ’ clock till four , without once sitting down . ”
austen	sense	“ did he indeed ? ” cried marianne with sparkling eyes , “ and with elegance , with spirit ? ” “ yes ; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert. ” “ that is what i like ; that is what a young man ought to be . whatever be his pursuits , his eagerness in them should know no moderation , and leave him no sense of fatigue . ”
austen	sense	“ aye , aye , i see how it will be , ” said sir john , “ i see how it will be . you will be setting your cap at him now , and never think of poor brandon . ”
austen	sense	“ that is an expression , sir john , ” said marianne , warmly , “ which i particularly dislike . i abhor every common-place phrase by which wit is intended ; and ‘ setting one ’ s cap at a man , ’ or ‘ making a conquest , ’ are the most odious of all . their tendency is gross and illiberal ; and if their construction could ever be deemed clever , time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity . ”
austen	sense	sir john did not much understand this reproof ; but he laughed as heartily as if he did , and then replied , “ ay , you will make conquests enough , i dare say , one way or other . poor brandon ! he is quite smitten already , and he is very well worth setting your cap at , i can tell you , in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining of ankles . ”
austen	sense	chapter x. marianne ’ s preserver , as margaret , with more elegance than precision , styled willoughby , called at the cottage early the next morning to make his personal enquiries . he was received by mrs. dashwood with more than politeness ; with a kindness which sir john ’ s account of him and her own gratitude prompted ; and every thing that passed during the visit tended to assure him of the sense , elegance , mutual affection , and domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced him . of their personal charms he had not required a second interview to be convinced .
austen	sense	miss dashwood had a delicate complexion , regular features , and a remarkably pretty figure . marianne was still handsomer . her form , though not so correct as her sister ’ s , in having the advantage of height , was more striking ; and her face was so lovely , that when in the common cant of praise , she was called a beautiful girl , truth was less violently outraged than usually happens . her skin was very brown , but , from its transparency , her complexion was uncommonly brilliant ; her features were all good ; her smile was sweet and attractive ; and in her eyes , which were very dark , there was a life , a spirit , an eagerness , which could hardly be seen without delight . from willoughby their expression was at first held back , by the embarrassment which the remembrance of his assistance created . but when this passed away , when her spirits became collected , when she saw that to the perfect good-breeding of the gentleman , he united frankness and vivacity , and above all , when she heard him declare , that of music and dancing he was passionately fond , she gave him such a look of approbation as secured the largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest of his stay .
austen	sense	it was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her to talk . she could not be silent when such points were introduced , and she had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion . they speedily discovered that their enjoyment of dancing and music was mutual , and that it arose from a general conformity of judgment in all that related to either . encouraged by this to a further examination of his opinions , she proceeded to question him on the subject of books ; her favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so rapturous a delight , that any young man of five and twenty must have been insensible indeed , not to become an immediate convert to the excellence of such works , however disregarded before . their taste was strikingly alike . the same books , the same passages were idolized by each—or if any difference appeared , any objection arose , it lasted no longer than till the force of her arguments and the brightness of her eyes could be displayed . he acquiesced in all her decisions , caught all her enthusiasm ; and long before his visit concluded , they conversed with the familiarity of a long-established acquaintance .
austen	sense	“ well , marianne , ” said elinor , as soon as he had left them , “ for _one_ morning i think you have done pretty well . you have already ascertained mr. willoughby ’ s opinion in almost every matter of importance . you know what he thinks of cowper and scott ; you are certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought , and you have received every assurance of his admiring pope no more than is proper . but how is your acquaintance to be long supported , under such extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse ? you will soon have exhausted each favourite topic . another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty , and second marriages , and then you can have nothing farther to ask . ”
austen	sense	“ elinor , ” cried marianne , “ is this fair ? is this just ? are my ideas so scanty ? but i see what you mean . i have been too much at my ease , too happy , too frank . i have erred against every common-place notion of decorum ; i have been open and sincere where i ought to have been reserved , spiritless , dull , and deceitful—had i talked only of the weather and the roads , and had i spoken only once in ten minutes , this reproach would have been spared . ”
austen	sense	“ my love , ” said her mother , “ you must not be offended with elinor—she was only in jest . i should scold her myself , if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend. ” marianne was softened in a moment .
austen	sense	willoughby , on his side , gave every proof of his pleasure in their acquaintance , which an evident wish of improving it could offer . he came to them every day . to enquire after marianne was at first his excuse ; but the encouragement of his reception , to which every day gave greater kindness , made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceased to be possible , by marianne ’ s perfect recovery . she was confined for some days to the house ; but never had any confinement been less irksome . willoughby was a young man of good abilities , quick imagination , lively spirits , and open , affectionate manners . he was exactly formed to engage marianne ’ s heart , for with all this , he joined not only a captivating person , but a natural ardour of mind which was now roused and increased by the example of her own , and which recommended him to her affection beyond every thing else .
austen	sense	his society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment . they read , they talked , they sang together ; his musical talents were considerable ; and he read with all the sensibility and spirit which edward had unfortunately wanted .
austen	sense	in mrs. dashwood ’ s estimation he was as faultless as in marianne ’ s ; and elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity , in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister , of saying too much what he thought on every occasion , without attention to persons or circumstances . in hastily forming and giving his opinion of other people , in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undivided attention where his heart was engaged , and in slighting too easily the forms of worldly propriety , he displayed a want of caution which elinor could not approve , in spite of all that he and marianne could say in its support .
austen	sense	marianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seized her at sixteen and a half , of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection , had been rash and unjustifiable . willoughby was all that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in every brighter period , as capable of attaching her ; and his behaviour declared his wishes to be in that respect as earnest , as his abilities were strong .
austen	sense	her mother too , in whose mind not one speculative thought of their marriage had been raised , by his prospect of riches , was led before the end of a week to hope and expect it ; and secretly to congratulate herself on having gained two such sons-in-law as edward and willoughby .
austen	sense	colonel brandon ’ s partiality for marianne , which had so early been discovered by his friends , now first became perceptible to elinor , when it ceased to be noticed by them . their attention and wit were drawn off to his more fortunate rival ; and the raillery which the other had incurred before any partiality arose , was removed when his feelings began really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility . elinor was obliged , though unwillingly , to believe that the sentiments which mrs. jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction , were now actually excited by her sister ; and that however a general resemblance of disposition between the parties might forward the affection of mr. willoughby , an equally striking opposition of character was no hindrance to the regard of colonel brandon . she saw it with concern ; for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope , when opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty ? and as she could not even wish him successful , she heartily wished him indifferent . she liked him—in spite of his gravity and reserve , she beheld in him an object of interest . his manners , though serious , were mild ; and his reserve appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits than of any natural gloominess of temper . sir john had dropped hints of past injuries and disappointments , which justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man , and she regarded him with respect and compassion .
austen	sense	perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted by willoughby and marianne , who , prejudiced against him for being neither lively nor young , seemed resolved to undervalue his merits .
austen	sense	“ brandon is just the kind of man , ” said willoughby one day , when they were talking of him together , “ whom every body speaks well of , and nobody cares about ; whom all are delighted to see , and nobody remembers to talk to . ”
austen	sense	“ that is exactly what i think of him , ” cried marianne . “ do not boast of it , however , ” said elinor , “ for it is injustice in both of you . he is highly esteemed by all the family at the park , and i never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him . ”
austen	sense	“ that he is patronised by _you_ , ” replied willoughby , “ is certainly in his favour ; but as for the esteem of the others , it is a reproach in itself . who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman as lady middleton and mrs. jennings , that could command the indifference of any body else ? ”
austen	sense	“ but perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and marianne will make amends for the regard of lady middleton and her mother . if their praise is censure , your censure may be praise , for they are not more undiscerning , than you are prejudiced and unjust . ”
austen	sense	“ in defence of your _protégé_ you can even be saucy. ” “ my _protégé_ , as you call him , is a sensible man ; and sense will always have attractions for me . yes , marianne , even in a man between thirty and forty . he has seen a great deal of the world ; has been abroad , has read , and has a thinking mind . i have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects ; and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of good-breeding and good nature . ”
austen	sense	“ that is to say , ” cried marianne contemptuously , “ he has told you , that in the east indies the climate is hot , and the mosquitoes are troublesome. ” “ he _would_ have told me so , i doubt not , had i made any such inquiries , but they happened to be points on which i had been previously informed . ”
austen	sense	“ perhaps , ” said willoughby , “ his observations may have extended to the existence of nabobs , gold mohrs , and palanquins. ” “ i may venture to say that _his_ observations have stretched much further than _your_ candour . but why should you dislike him ? ”
austen	sense	“ i do not dislike him . i consider him , on the contrary , as a very respectable man , who has every body ’ s good word , and nobody ’ s notice ; who has more money than he can spend , more time than he knows how to employ , and two new coats every year . ”
austen	sense	“ add to which , ” cried marianne , “ that he has neither genius , taste , nor spirit . that his understanding has no brilliancy , his feelings no ardour , and his voice no expression. ” “ you decide on his imperfections so much in the mass , ” replied elinor , “ and so much on the strength of your own imagination , that the commendation _i_ am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid . i can only pronounce him to be a sensible man , well-bred , well-informed , of gentle address , and , i believe , possessing an amiable heart . ”
austen	sense	“ miss dashwood , ” cried willoughby , “ you are now using me unkindly . you are endeavouring to disarm me by reason , and to convince me against my will . but it will not do . you shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful . i have three unanswerable reasons for disliking colonel brandon ; he threatened me with rain when i wanted it to be fine ; he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle , and i can not persuade him to buy my brown mare . if it will be any satisfaction to you , however , to be told , that i believe his character to be in other respects irreproachable , i am ready to confess it . and in return for an acknowledgment , which must give me some pain , you can not deny me the privilege of disliking him as much as ever . ”
austen	sense	chapter xi . little had mrs. dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first came into devonshire , that so many engagements would arise to occupy their time as shortly presented themselves , or that they should have such frequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little leisure for serious employment . yet such was the case . when marianne was recovered , the schemes of amusement at home and abroad , which sir john had been previously forming , were put into execution . the private balls at the park then began ; and parties on the water were made and accomplished as often as a showery october would allow . in every meeting of the kind willoughby was included ; and the ease and familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the dashwoods , to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of marianne , of marking his animated admiration of her , and of receiving , in her behaviour to himself , the most pointed assurance of her affection .
austen	sense	elinor could not be surprised at their attachment . she only wished that it were less openly shown ; and once or twice did venture to suggest the propriety of some self-command to marianne . but marianne abhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve ; and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselves illaudable , appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort , but a disgraceful subjection of reason to common-place and mistaken notions . willoughby thought the same ; and their behaviour at all times , was an illustration of their opinions .
austen	sense	when he was present she had no eyes for any one else . every thing he did , was right . every thing he said , was clever . if their evenings at the park were concluded with cards , he cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get her a good hand . if dancing formed the amusement of the night , they were partners for half the time ; and when obliged to separate for a couple of dances , were careful to stand together and scarcely spoke a word to any body else . such conduct made them of course most exceedingly laughed at ; but ridicule could not shame , and seemed hardly to provoke them .
austen	sense	mrs. dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left her no inclination for checking this excessive display of them . to her it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind .
austen	sense	this was the season of happiness to marianne . her heart was devoted to willoughby , and the fond attachment to norland , which she brought with her from sussex , was more likely to be softened than she had thought it possible before , by the charms which his society bestowed on her present home .
austen	sense	elinor ’ s happiness was not so great . her heart was not so much at ease , nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure . they afforded her no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind , nor that could teach her to think of norland with less regret than ever . neither lady middleton nor mrs. jennings could supply to her the conversation she missed ; although the latter was an everlasting talker , and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her a large share of her discourse . she had already repeated her own history to elinor three or four times ; and had elinor ’ s memory been equal to her means of improvement , she might have known very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of mr. jennings ’ s last illness , and what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died . lady middleton was more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent . elinor needed little observation to perceive that her reserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do . towards her husband and mother she was the same as to them ; and intimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor desired . she had nothing to say one day that she had not said the day before . her insipidity was invariable , for even her spirits were always the same ; and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband , provided every thing were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her , she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in sitting at home ; —and so little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others , by any share in their conversation , that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys .
austen	sense	in colonel brandon alone , of all her new acquaintance , did elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities , excite the interest of friendship , or give pleasure as a companion . willoughby was out of the question . her admiration and regard , even her sisterly regard , was all his own ; but he was a lover ; his attentions were wholly marianne ’ s , and a far less agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing . colonel brandon , unfortunately for himself , had no such encouragement to think only of marianne , and in conversing with elinor he found the greatest consolation for the indifference of her sister .
austen	sense	elinor ’ s compassion for him increased , as she had reason to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him . this suspicion was given by some words which accidentally dropped from him one evening at the park , when they were sitting down together by mutual consent , while the others were dancing . his eyes were fixed on marianne , and , after a silence of some minutes , he said , with a faint smile , “ your sister , i understand , does not approve of second attachments . ”
austen	sense	“ no , ” replied elinor , “ her opinions are all romantic. ” “ or rather , as i believe , she considers them impossible to exist. ” “ i believe she does . but how she contrives it without reflecting on the character of her own father , who had himself two wives , i know not . a few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of common sense and observation ; and then they may be more easy to define and to justify than they now are , by any body but herself . ”
austen	sense	“ this will probably be the case , ” he replied ; “ and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind , that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions . ”
austen	sense	“ i can not agree with you there , ” said elinor . “ there are inconveniences attending such feelings as marianne ’ s , which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world can not atone for . her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought ; and a better acquaintance with the world is what i look forward to as her greatest possible advantage . ”
austen	sense	after a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying , — “ does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment ? or is it equally criminal in every body ? are those who have been disappointed in their first choice , whether from the inconstancy of its object , or the perverseness of circumstances , to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives ? ”
austen	sense	“ upon my word , i am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles . i only know that i never yet heard her admit any instance of a second attachment ’ s being pardonable . ”
austen	sense	“ this , ” said he , “ can not hold ; but a change , a total change of sentiments—no , no , do not desire it ; for when the romantic refinements of a young mind are obliged to give way , how frequently are they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common , and too dangerous ! i speak from experience . i once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister , who thought and judged like her , but who from an enforced change—from a series of unfortunate circumstances— ” here he stopt suddenly ; appeared to think that he had said too much , and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures , which might not otherwise have entered elinor ’ s head . the lady would probably have passed without suspicion , had he not convinced miss dashwood that what concerned her ought not to escape his lips . as it was , it required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion with the tender recollection of past regard . elinor attempted no more . but marianne , in her place , would not have done so little . the whole story would have been speedily formed under her active imagination ; and every thing established in the most melancholy order of disastrous love .
austen	sense	chapter xii . as elinor and marianne were walking together the next morning the latter communicated a piece of news to her sister , which in spite of all that she knew before of marianne ’ s imprudence and want of thought , surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both . marianne told her , with the greatest delight , that willoughby had given her a horse , one that he had bred himself on his estate in somersetshire , and which was exactly calculated to carry a woman . without considering that it was not in her mother ’ s plan to keep any horse , that if she were to alter her resolution in favour of this gift , she must buy another for the servant , and keep a servant to ride it , and after all , build a stable to receive them , she had accepted the present without hesitation , and told her sister of it in raptures .
austen	sense	“ he intends to send his groom into somersetshire immediately for it , ” she added , “ and when it arrives we will ride every day . you shall share its use with me . imagine to yourself , my dear elinor , the delight of a gallop on some of these downs . ”
austen	sense	most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair ; and for some time she refused to submit to them . as to an additional servant , the expense would be a trifle ; mama she was sure would never object to it ; and any horse would do for _him ; _ he might always get one at the park ; as to a stable , the merest shed would be sufficient . elinor then ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present from a man so little , or at least so lately known to her . this was too much .
austen	sense	“ you are mistaken , elinor , ” said she warmly , “ in supposing i know very little of willoughby . i have not known him long indeed , but i am much better acquainted with him , than i am with any other creature in the world , except yourself and mama . it is not time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy ; —it is disposition alone . seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other , and seven days are more than enough for others . i should hold myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother , than from willoughby . of john i know very little , though we have lived together for years ; but of willoughby my judgment has long been formed . ”
austen	sense	elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more . she knew her sister ’ s temper . opposition on so tender a subject would only attach her the more to her own opinion . but by an appeal to her affection for her mother , by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent mother must draw on herself , if ( as would probably be the case ) she consented to this increase of establishment , marianne was shortly subdued ; and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning the offer , and to tell willoughby when she saw him next , that it must be declined .
austen	sense	she was faithful to her word ; and when willoughby called at the cottage , the same day , elinor heard her express her disappointment to him in a low voice , on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his present . the reasons for this alteration were at the same time related , and they were such as to make further entreaty on his side impossible . his concern however was very apparent ; and after expressing it with earnestness , he added , in the same low voice , — “ but , marianne , the horse is still yours , though you can not use it now . i shall keep it only till you can claim it . when you leave barton to form your own establishment in a more lasting home , queen mab shall receive you . ”
austen	sense	this was all overheard by miss dashwood ; and in the whole of the sentence , in his manner of pronouncing it , and in his addressing her sister by her christian name alone , she instantly saw an intimacy so decided , a meaning so direct , as marked a perfect agreement between them . from that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each other ; and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she , or any of their friends , should be left by tempers so frank , to discover it by accident .
austen	sense	margaret related something to her the next day , which placed this matter in a still clearer light . willoughby had spent the preceding evening with them , and margaret , by being left some time in the parlour with only him and marianne , had had opportunity for observations , which , with a most important face , she communicated to her eldest sister , when they were next by themselves .
austen	sense	“ oh , elinor ! ” she cried , “ i have such a secret to tell you about marianne . i am sure she will be married to mr. willoughby very soon. ” “ you have said so , ” replied elinor , “ almost every day since they first met on high-church down ; and they had not known each other a week , i believe , before you were certain that marianne wore his picture round her neck ; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle . ”
austen	sense	“ but indeed this is quite another thing . i am sure they will be married very soon , for he has got a lock of her hair. ” “ take care , margaret . it may be only the hair of some great uncle of _his_ . ”
austen	sense	“ but , indeed , elinor , it is marianne ’ s . i am almost sure it is , for i saw him cut it off . last night after tea , when you and mama went out of the room , they were whispering and talking together as fast as could be , and he seemed to be begging something of her , and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair , for it was all tumbled down her back ; and he kissed it , and folded it up in a piece of white paper ; and put it into his pocket-book . ”
austen	sense	for such particulars , stated on such authority , elinor could not withhold her credit ; nor was she disposed to it , for the circumstance was in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself .
austen	sense	margaret ’ s sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory to her sister . when mrs. jennings attacked her one evening at the park , to give the name of the young man who was elinor ’ s particular favourite , which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her , margaret answered by looking at her sister , and saying , “ i must not tell , may i , elinor ? ”
austen	sense	this of course made every body laugh ; and elinor tried to laugh too . but the effort was painful . she was convinced that margaret had fixed on a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become a standing joke with mrs. jennings .
austen	sense	marianne felt for her most sincerely ; but she did more harm than good to the cause , by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to margaret , “ remember that whatever your conjectures may be , you have no right to repeat them . ”
austen	sense	“ i never had any conjectures about it , ” replied margaret ; “ it was you who told me of it yourself. ” this increased the mirth of the company , and margaret was eagerly pressed to say something more .
austen	sense	“ oh ! pray , miss margaret , let us know all about it , ” said mrs. jennings . “ what is the gentleman ’ s name ? ” “ i must not tell , ma ’ am . but i know very well what it is ; and i know where he is too . ”
austen	sense	“ yes , yes , we can guess where he is ; at his own house at norland to be sure . he is the curate of the parish i dare say. ” “ no , _that_ he is not . he is of no profession at all . ”
austen	sense	“ margaret , ” said marianne with great warmth , “ you know that all this is an invention of your own , and that there is no such person in existence. ” “ well , then , he is lately dead , marianne , for i am sure there was such a man once , and his name begins with an f . ”
austen	sense	most grateful did elinor feel to lady middleton for observing , at this moment , “ that it rained very hard , ” though she believed the interruption to proceed less from any attention to her , than from her ladyship ’ s great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as delighted her husband and mother . the idea however started by her , was immediately pursued by colonel brandon , who was on every occasion mindful of the feelings of others ; and much was said on the subject of rain by both of them . willoughby opened the piano-forte , and asked marianne to sit down to it ; and thus amidst the various endeavours of different people to quit the topic , it fell to the ground . but not so easily did elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her .
austen	sense	a party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see a very fine place about twelve miles from barton , belonging to a brother-in-law of colonel brandon , without whose interest it could not be seen , as the proprietor , who was then abroad , had left strict orders on that head . the grounds were declared to be highly beautiful , and sir john , who was particularly warm in their praise , might be allowed to be a tolerable judge , for he had formed parties to visit them , at least , twice every summer for the last ten years . they contained a noble piece of water ; a sail on which was to form a great part of the morning ’ s amusement ; cold provisions were to be taken , open carriages only to be employed , and every thing conducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure .
austen	sense	to some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking , considering the time of year , and that it had rained every day for the last fortnight ; —and mrs. dashwood , who had already a cold , was persuaded by elinor to stay at home .
austen	sense	chapter xiii . their intended excursion to whitwell turned out very different from what elinor had expected . she was prepared to be wet through , fatigued , and frightened ; but the event was still more unfortunate , for they did not go at all .
austen	sense	by ten o ’ clock the whole party was assembled at the park , where they were to breakfast . the morning was rather favourable , though it had rained all night , as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky , and the sun frequently appeared . they were all in high spirits and good humour , eager to be happy , and determined to submit to the greatest inconveniences and hardships rather than be otherwise .
austen	sense	while they were at breakfast the letters were brought in . among the rest there was one for colonel brandon ; —he took it , looked at the direction , changed colour , and immediately left the room .
austen	sense	“ what is the matter with brandon ? ” said sir john . nobody could tell . “ i hope he has had no bad news , ” said lady middleton . “ it must be something extraordinary that could make colonel brandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly . ”
austen	sense	in about five minutes he returned . “ no bad news , colonel , i hope ; ” said mrs. jennings , as soon as he entered the room . “ none at all , ma ’ am , i thank you. ” “ was it from avignon ? i hope it is not to say that your sister is worse . ”
austen	sense	“ no , ma ’ am . it came from town , and is merely a letter of business. ” “ but how came the hand to discompose you so much , if it was only a letter of business ? come , come , this won ’ t do , colonel ; so let us hear the truth of it . ”
austen	sense	“ my dear madam , ” said lady middleton , “ recollect what you are saying. ” “ perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin fanny is married ? ” said mrs. jennings , without attending to her daughter ’ s reproof .
austen	sense	“ no , indeed , it is not. ” “ well , then , i know who it is from , colonel . and i hope she is well. ” “ whom do you mean , ma ’ am ? ” said he , colouring a little .
austen	sense	“ oh ! you know who i mean. ” “ i am particularly sorry , ma ’ am , ” said he , addressing lady middleton , “ that i should receive this letter today , for it is on business which requires my immediate attendance in town . ”
austen	sense	“ in town ! ” cried mrs. jennings . “ what can you have to do in town at this time of year ? ” “ my own loss is great , ” he continued , “ in being obliged to leave so agreeable a party ; but i am the more concerned , as i fear my presence is necessary to gain your admittance at whitwell . ”
austen	sense	what a blow upon them all was this ! “ but if you write a note to the housekeeper , mr. brandon , ” said marianne , eagerly , “ will it not be sufficient ? ” he shook his head .
austen	sense	“ we must go , ” said sir john.— “ it shall not be put off when we are so near it . you can not go to town till tomorrow , brandon , that is all. ” “ i wish it could be so easily settled . but it is not in my power to delay my journey for one day ! ”
austen	sense	“ if you would but let us know what your business is , ” said mrs. jennings , “ we might see whether it could be put off or not. ” “ you would not be six hours later , ” said willoughby , “ if you were to defer your journey till our return . ”
austen	sense	“ i can not afford to lose _one_ hour. ” elinor then heard willoughby say , in a low voice to marianne , “ there are some people who can not bear a party of pleasure . brandon is one of them . he was afraid of catching cold i dare say , and invented this trick for getting out of it . i would lay fifty guineas the letter was of his own writing . ”
austen	sense	“ i have no doubt of it , ” replied marianne . “ there is no persuading you to change your mind , brandon , i know of old , ” said sir john , “ when once you are determined on anything . but , however , i hope you will think better of it . consider , here are the two miss careys come over from newton , the three miss dashwoods walked up from the cottage , and mr. willoughby got up two hours before his usual time , on purpose to go to whitwell . ”
austen	sense	colonel brandon again repeated his sorrow at being the cause of disappointing the party ; but at the same time declared it to be unavoidable . “ well , then , when will you come back again ? ”
austen	sense	“ i hope we shall see you at barton , ” added her ladyship , “ as soon as you can conveniently leave town ; and we must put off the party to whitwell till you return . ”
austen	sense	“ you are very obliging . but it is so uncertain , when i may have it in my power to return , that i dare not engage for it at all. ” “ oh ! he must and shall come back , ” cried sir john . “ if he is not here by the end of the week , i shall go after him . ”
austen	sense	“ ay , so do , sir john , ” cried mrs. jennings , “ and then perhaps you may find out what his business is. ” “ i do not want to pry into other men ’ s concerns . i suppose it is something he is ashamed of . ”
austen	sense	colonel brandon ’ s horses were announced . “ you do not go to town on horseback , do you ? ” added sir john . “ no . only to honiton . i shall then go post. ” “ well , as you are resolved to go , i wish you a good journey . but you had better change your mind . ”
austen	sense	“ i assure you it is not in my power. ” he then took leave of the whole party . “ is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this winter , miss dashwood ? ”
austen	sense	“ i am afraid , none at all. ” “ then i must bid you farewell for a longer time than i should wish to do. ” to marianne , he merely bowed and said nothing .
austen	sense	“ come colonel , ” said mrs. jennings , “ before you go , do let us know what you are going about. ” he wished her a good morning , and , attended by sir john , left the room .
austen	sense	the complaints and lamentations which politeness had hitherto restrained , now burst forth universally ; and they all agreed again and again how provoking it was to be so disappointed . “ i can guess what his business is , however , ” said mrs. jennings exultingly .
austen	sense	“ can you , ma ’ am ? ” said almost every body . “ yes ; it is about miss williams , i am sure. ” “ and who is miss williams ? ” asked marianne . “ what ! do not you know who miss williams is ? i am sure you must have heard of her before . she is a relation of the colonel ’ s , my dear ; a very near relation . we will not say how near , for fear of shocking the young ladies. ” then , lowering her voice a little , she said to elinor , “ she is his natural daughter . ”
austen	sense	“ indeed ! ” “ oh , yes ; and as like him as she can stare . i dare say the colonel will leave her all his fortune. ” when sir john returned , he joined most heartily in the general regret on so unfortunate an event ; concluding however by observing , that as they were all got together , they must do something by way of being happy ; and after some consultation it was agreed , that although happiness could only be enjoyed at whitwell , they might procure a tolerable composure of mind by driving about the country . the carriages were then ordered ; willoughby ’ s was first , and marianne never looked happier than when she got into it . he drove through the park very fast , and they were soon out of sight ; and nothing more of them was seen till their return , which did not happen till after the return of all the rest . they both seemed delighted with their drive ; but said only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes , while the others went on the downs .
austen	sense	it was settled that there should be a dance in the evening , and that every body should be extremely merry all day long . some more of the careys came to dinner , and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table , which sir john observed with great contentment . willoughby took his usual place between the two elder miss dashwoods . mrs. jennings sat on elinor ’ s right hand ; and they had not been long seated , before she leant behind her and willoughby , and said to marianne , loud enough for them both to hear , “ i have found you out in spite of all your tricks . i know where you spent the morning . ”
austen	sense	marianne coloured , and replied very hastily , “ where , pray ? ” “ did not you know , ” said willoughby , “ that we had been out in my curricle ? ” “ yes , yes , mr. impudence , i know that very well , and i was determined to find out _where_ you had been to . i hope you like your house , miss marianne . it is a very large one , i know ; and when i come to see you , i hope you will have new-furnished it , for it wanted it very much when i was there six years ago . ”
austen	sense	marianne turned away in great confusion . mrs. jennings laughed heartily ; and elinor found that in her resolution to know where they had been , she had actually made her own woman enquire of mr. willoughby ’ s groom ; and that she had by that method been informed that they had gone to allenham , and spent a considerable time there in walking about the garden and going all over the house .
austen	sense	elinor could hardly believe this to be true , as it seemed very unlikely that willoughby should propose , or marianne consent , to enter the house while mrs. smith was in it , with whom marianne had not the smallest acquaintance .
austen	sense	as soon as they left the dining-room , elinor enquired of her about it ; and great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance related by mrs. jennings was perfectly true . marianne was quite angry with her for doubting it .
austen	sense	“ why should you imagine , elinor , that we did not go there , or that we did not see the house ? is not it what you have often wished to do yourself ? ”
austen	sense	“ yes , marianne , but i would not go while mrs. smith was there , and with no other companion than mr. willoughby. ” “ mr . willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to show that house ; and as he went in an open carriage , it was impossible to have any other companion . i never spent a pleasanter morning in my life . ”
austen	sense	“ i am afraid , ” replied elinor , “ that the pleasantness of an employment does not always evince its propriety. ” “ on the contrary , nothing can be a stronger proof of it , elinor ; for if there had been any real impropriety in what i did , i should have been sensible of it at the time , for we always know when we are acting wrong , and with such a conviction i could have had no pleasure . ”
austen	sense	“ but , my dear marianne , as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks , do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct ? ” “ if the impertinent remarks of mrs. jennings are to be the proof of impropriety in conduct , we are all offending every moment of our lives . i value not her censure any more than i should do her commendation . i am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over mrs. smith ’ s grounds , or in seeing her house . they will one day be mr. willoughby ’ s , and— ”
austen	sense	“ if they were one day to be your own , marianne , you would not be justified in what you have done. ” she blushed at this hint ; but it was even visibly gratifying to her ; and after a ten minutes ’ interval of earnest thought , she came to her sister again , and said with great good humour , “ perhaps , elinor , it _was_ rather ill-judged in me to go to allenham ; but mr. willoughby wanted particularly to show me the place ; and it is a charming house , i assure you.—there is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs ; of a nice comfortable size for constant use , and with modern furniture it would be delightful . it is a corner room , and has windows on two sides . on one side you look across the bowling-green , behind the house , to a beautiful hanging wood , and on the other you have a view of the church and village , and , beyond them , of those fine bold hills that we have so often admired . i did not see it to advantage , for nothing could be more forlorn than the furniture , —but if it were newly fitted up—a couple of hundred pounds , willoughby says , would make it one of the pleasantest summer-rooms in england . ”
austen	sense	could elinor have listened to her without interruption from the others , she would have described every room in the house with equal delight . chapter xiv . the sudden termination of colonel brandon ’ s visit at the park , with his steadiness in concealing its cause , filled the mind , and raised the wonder of mrs. jennings for two or three days ; she was a great wonderer , as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in all the comings and goings of all their acquaintance . she wondered , with little intermission what could be the reason of it ; was sure there must be some bad news , and thought over every kind of distress that could have befallen him , with a fixed determination that he should not escape them all .
austen	sense	“ something very melancholy must be the matter , i am sure , ” said she . “ i could see it in his face . poor man ! i am afraid his circumstances may be bad . the estate at delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand a year , and his brother left everything sadly involved . i do think he must have been sent for about money matters , for what else can it be ? i wonder whether it is so . i would give anything to know the truth of it . perhaps it is about miss williams and , by the bye , i dare say it is , because he looked so conscious when i mentioned her . may be she is ill in town ; nothing in the world more likely , for i have a notion she is always rather sickly . i would lay any wager it is about miss williams . it is not so very likely he should be distressed in his circumstances _now_ , for he is a very prudent man , and to be sure must have cleared the estate by this time . i wonder what it can be ! may be his sister is worse at avignon , and has sent for him over . his setting off in such a hurry seems very like it . well , i wish him out of all his trouble with all my heart , and a good wife into the bargain . ”
austen	sense	so wondered , so talked mrs. jennings . her opinion varying with every fresh conjecture , and all seeming equally probable as they arose . elinor , though she felt really interested in the welfare of colonel brandon , could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly away , which mrs. jennings was desirous of her feeling ; for besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting amazement or variety of speculation , her wonder was otherwise disposed of . it was engrossed by the extraordinary silence of her sister and willoughby on the subject , which they must know to be peculiarly interesting to them all . as this silence continued , every day made it appear more strange and more incompatible with the disposition of both . why they should not openly acknowledge to her mother and herself , what their constant behaviour to each other declared to have taken place , elinor could not imagine .
austen	sense	she could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately in their power ; for though willoughby was independent , there was no reason to believe him rich . his estate had been rated by sir john at about six or seven hundred a year ; but he lived at an expense to which that income could hardly be equal , and he had himself often complained of his poverty . but for this strange kind of secrecy maintained by them relative to their engagement , which in fact concealed nothing at all , she could not account ; and it was so wholly contradictory to their general opinions and practice , that a doubt sometimes entered her mind of their being really engaged , and this doubt was enough to prevent her making any inquiry of marianne .
austen	sense	nothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all , than willoughby ’ s behaviour . to marianne it had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover ’ s heart could give , and to the rest of the family it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother . the cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home ; many more of his hours were spent there than at allenham ; and if no general engagement collected them at the park , the exercise which called him out in the morning was almost certain of ending there , where the rest of the day was spent by himself at the side of marianne , and by his favourite pointer at her feet .
austen	sense	one evening in particular , about a week after colonel brandon left the country , his heart seemed more than usually open to every feeling of attachment to the objects around him ; and on mrs. dashwood ’ s happening to mention her design of improving the cottage in the spring , he warmly opposed every alteration of a place which affection had established as perfect with him .
austen	sense	“ what ! ” he exclaimed— “ improve this dear cottage ! no . _that_ i will never consent to . not a stone must be added to its walls , not an inch to its size , if my feelings are regarded . ”
austen	sense	“ do not be alarmed , ” said miss dashwood , “ nothing of the kind will be done ; for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it. ” “ i am heartily glad of it , ” he cried . “ may she always be poor , if she can employ her riches no better . ”
austen	sense	“ thank you , willoughby . but you may be assured that i would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours , or of any one whom i loved , for all the improvements in the world . depend upon it that whatever unemployed sum may remain , when i make up my accounts in the spring , i would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it in a manner so painful to you . but are you really so attached to this place as to see no defect in it ? ”
austen	sense	“ i am , ” said he . “ to me it is faultless . nay , more , i consider it as the only form of building in which happiness is attainable , and were i rich enough i would instantly pull combe down , and build it up again in the exact plan of this cottage . ”
austen	sense	“ with dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes , i suppose , ” said elinor . “ yes , ” cried he in the same eager tone , “ with all and every thing belonging to it ; —in no one convenience or inconvenience about it , should the least variation be perceptible . then , and then only , under such a roof , i might perhaps be as happy at combe as i have been at barton . ”
austen	sense	“ i flatter myself , ” replied elinor , “ that even under the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase , you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you now do this . ”
austen	sense	“ there certainly are circumstances , ” said willoughby , “ which might greatly endear it to me ; but this place will always have one claim of my affection , which no other can possibly share . ”
austen	sense	mrs. dashwood looked with pleasure at marianne , whose fine eyes were fixed so expressively on willoughby , as plainly denoted how well she understood him . “ how often did i wish , ” added he , “ when i was at allenham this time twelvemonth , that barton cottage were inhabited ! i never passed within view of it without admiring its situation , and grieving that no one should live in it . how little did i then think that the very first news i should hear from mrs. smith , when i next came into the country , would be that barton cottage was taken : and i felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event , which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness i should experience from it , can account for . must it not have been so , marianne ? ” speaking to her in a lowered voice . then continuing his former tone , he said , “ and yet this house you would spoil , mrs. dashwood ? you would rob it of its simplicity by imaginary improvement ! and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance first began , and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by us together , you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance , and every body would be eager to pass through the room which has hitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford . ”
austen	sense	mrs. dashwood again assured him that no alteration of the kind should be attempted . “ you are a good woman , ” he warmly replied . “ your promise makes me easy . extend it a little farther , and it will make me happy . tell me that not only your house will remain the same , but that i shall ever find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling ; and that you will always consider me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to you so dear to me . ”
austen	sense	the promise was readily given , and willoughby ’ s behaviour during the whole of the evening declared at once his affection and happiness . “ shall we see you tomorrow to dinner ? ” said mrs. dashwood , when he was leaving them . “ i do not ask you to come in the morning , for we must walk to the park , to call on lady middleton . ”
austen	sense	he engaged to be with them by four o ’ clock . chapter xv . mrs. dashwood ’ s visit to lady middleton took place the next day , and two of her daughters went with her ; but marianne excused herself from being of the party , under some trifling pretext of employment ; and her mother , who concluded that a promise had been made by willoughby the night before of calling on her while they were absent , was perfectly satisfied with her remaining at home .
austen	sense	on their return from the park they found willoughby ’ s curricle and servant in waiting at the cottage , and mrs. dashwood was convinced that her conjecture had been just . so far it was all as she had foreseen ; but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had taught her to expect . they were no sooner in the passage than marianne came hastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction , with her handkerchief at her eyes ; and without noticing them ran up stairs . surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had just quitted , where they found only willoughby , who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his back towards them . he turned round on their coming in , and his countenance showed that he strongly partook of the emotion which over-powered marianne .
austen	sense	“ is anything the matter with her ? ” cried mrs. dashwood as she entered— “ is she ill ? ” “ i hope not , ” he replied , trying to look cheerful ; and with a forced smile presently added , “ it is i who may rather expect to be ill—for i am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment ! ”
austen	sense	“ disappointment ? ” “ yes , for i am unable to keep my engagement with you . mrs. smith has this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent cousin , by sending me on business to london . i have just received my dispatches , and taken my farewell of allenham ; and by way of exhilaration i am now come to take my farewell of you . ”
austen	sense	“ to london ! —and are you going this morning ? ” “ almost this moment. ” “ this is very unfortunate . but mrs. smith must be obliged ; —and her business will not detain you from us long i hope . ”
austen	sense	he coloured as he replied , “ you are very kind , but i have no idea of returning into devonshire immediately . my visits to mrs. smith are never repeated within the twelvemonth . ”
austen	sense	“ and is mrs. smith your only friend ? is allenham the only house in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome ? for shame , willoughby , can you wait for an invitation here ? ”
austen	sense	his colour increased ; and with his eyes fixed on the ground he only replied , “ you are too good. ” mrs. dashwood looked at elinor with surprise . elinor felt equal amazement . for a few moments every one was silent . mrs. dashwood first spoke .
austen	sense	“ i have only to add , my dear willoughby , that at barton cottage you will always be welcome ; for i will not press you to return here immediately , because you only can judge how far _that_ might be pleasing to mrs. smith ; and on this head i shall be no more disposed to question your judgment than to doubt your inclination . ”
austen	sense	“ my engagements at present , ” replied willoughby , confusedly , “ are of such a nature—that—i dare not flatter myself— ” he stopped . mrs. dashwood was too much astonished to speak , and another pause succeeded . this was broken by willoughby , who said with a faint smile , “ it is folly to linger in this manner . i will not torment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is impossible for me now to enjoy . ”
austen	sense	he then hastily took leave of them all and left the room . they saw him step into his carriage , and in a minute it was out of sight . mrs. dashwood felt too much for speech , and instantly quitted the parlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which this sudden departure occasioned .
austen	sense	elinor ’ s uneasiness was at least equal to her mother ’ s . she thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust . willoughby ’ s behaviour in taking leave of them , his embarrassment , and affectation of cheerfulness , and , above all , his unwillingness to accept her mother ’ s invitation , a backwardness so unlike a lover , so unlike himself , greatly disturbed her . one moment she feared that no serious design had ever been formed on his side ; and the next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him and her sister ; —the distress in which marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for , though when she considered what marianne ’ s love for him was , a quarrel seemed almost impossible .
austen	sense	but whatever might be the particulars of their separation , her sister ’ s affliction was indubitable ; and she thought with the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow which marianne was in all probability not merely giving way to as a relief , but feeding and encouraging as a duty .
austen	sense	in about half an hour her mother returned , and though her eyes were red , her countenance was not uncheerful . “ our dear willoughby is now some miles from barton , elinor , ” said she , as she sat down to work , “ and with how heavy a heart does he travel ? ”
austen	sense	“ it is all very strange . so suddenly to be gone ! it seems but the work of a moment . and last night he was with us so happy , so cheerful , so affectionate ? and now , after only ten minutes notice—gone too without intending to return ! —something more than what he owned to us must have happened . he did not speak , he did not behave like himself . _you_ must have seen the difference as well as i . what can it be ? can they have quarrelled ? why else should he have shown such unwillingness to accept your invitation here ? ”
austen	sense	“ it was not inclination that he wanted , elinor ; i could plainly see _that_ . he had not the power of accepting it . i have thought it all over i assure you , and i can perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed strange to me as well as to you . ”
austen	sense	“ can you , indeed ! ” “ yes . i have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way ; —but you , elinor , who love to doubt where you can—it will not satisfy _you_ , i know ; but you shall not talk _me_ out of my trust in it . i am persuaded that mrs. smith suspects his regard for marianne , disapproves of it , ( perhaps because she has other views for him , ) and on that account is eager to get him away ; —and that the business which she sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him . this is what i believe to have happened . he is , moreover , aware that she _does_ disapprove the connection , he dares not therefore at present confess to her his engagement with marianne , and he feels himself obliged , from his dependent situation , to give into her schemes , and absent himself from devonshire for a while . you will tell me , i know , that this may or may _not_ have happened ; but i will listen to no cavil , unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this . and now , elinor , what have you to say ? ”
austen	sense	“ nothing , for you have anticipated my answer. ” “ then you would have told me , that it might or might not have happened . oh , elinor , how incomprehensible are your feelings ! you had rather take evil upon credit than good . you had rather look out for misery for marianne , and guilt for poor willoughby , than an apology for the latter . you are resolved to think him blameable , because he took leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shown . and is no allowance to be made for inadvertence , or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment ? are no probabilities to be accepted , merely because they are not certainties ? is nothing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love , and no reason in the world to think ill of ? to the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves , though unavoidably secret for a while ? and , after all , what is it you suspect him of ? ”
austen	sense	“ i can hardly tell myself . but suspicion of something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him . there is great truth , however , in what you have now urged of the allowances which ought to be made for him , and it is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body . willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient reasons for his conduct , and i will hope that he has . but it would have been more like willoughby to acknowledge them at once . secrecy may be advisable ; but still i can not help wondering at its being practiced by him . ”
austen	sense	“ do not blame him , however , for departing from his character , where the deviation is necessary . but you really do admit the justice of what i have said in his defence ? —i am happy—and he is acquitted . ”
austen	sense	“ not entirely . it may be proper to conceal their engagement ( if they _are_ engaged ) from mrs. smith—and if that is the case , it must be highly expedient for willoughby to be but little in devonshire at present . but this is no excuse for their concealing it from us . ”
austen	sense	“ concealing it from us ! my dear child , do you accuse willoughby and marianne of concealment ? this is strange indeed , when your eyes have been reproaching them every day for incautiousness . ”
austen	sense	“ i want no proof of their affection , ” said elinor ; “ but of their engagement i do. ” “ i am perfectly satisfied of both. ” “ yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject , by either of them . ”
austen	sense	“ i have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly . has not his behaviour to marianne and to all of us , for at least the last fortnight , declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife , and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation ? have we not perfectly understood each other ? has not my consent been daily asked by his looks , his manner , his attentive and affectionate respect ? my elinor , is it possible to doubt their engagement ? how could such a thought occur to you ? how is it to be supposed that willoughby , persuaded as he must be of your sister ’ s love , should leave her , and leave her perhaps for months , without telling her of his affection ; —that they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence ? ”
austen	sense	“ i confess , ” replied elinor , “ that every circumstance except _one_ is in favour of their engagement ; but that _one_ is the total silence of both on the subject , and with me it almost outweighs every other . ”
austen	sense	“ how strange this is ! you must think wretchedly indeed of willoughby , if , after all that has openly passed between them , you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together . has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister all this time ? do you suppose him really indifferent to her ? ”
austen	sense	“ no , i can not think that . he must and does love her i am sure. ” “ but with a strange kind of tenderness , if he can leave her with such indifference , such carelessness of the future , as you attribute to him . ”
austen	sense	“ you must remember , my dear mother , that i have never considered this matter as certain . i have had my doubts , i confess ; but they are fainter than they were , and they may soon be entirely done away . if we find they correspond , every fear of mine will be removed . ”
austen	sense	“ a mighty concession indeed ! if you were to see them at the altar , you would suppose they were going to be married . ungracious girl ! but _i_ require no such proof . nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt ; no secrecy has been attempted ; all has been uniformly open and unreserved . you can not doubt your sister ’ s wishes . it must be willoughby therefore whom you suspect . but why ? is he not a man of honour and feeling ? has there been any inconsistency on his side to create alarm ? can he be deceitful ? ”
austen	sense	“ i hope not , i believe not , ” cried elinor . “ i love willoughby , sincerely love him ; and suspicion of his integrity can not be more painful to yourself than to me . it has been involuntary , and i will not encourage it . i was startled , i confess , by the alteration in his manners this morning ; —he did not speak like himself , and did not return your kindness with any cordiality . but all this may be explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed . he had just parted from my sister , had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction ; and if he felt obliged , from a fear of offending mrs. smith , to resist the temptation of returning here soon , and yet aware that by declining your invitation , by saying that he was going away for some time , he should seem to act an ungenerous , a suspicious part by our family , he might well be embarrassed and disturbed . in such a case , a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more to his honour i think , as well as more consistent with his general character ; —but i will not raise objections against any one ’ s conduct on so illiberal a foundation , as a difference in judgment from myself , or a deviation from what i may think right and consistent . ”
austen	sense	“ you speak very properly . willoughby certainly does not deserve to be suspected . though _we_ have not known him long , he is no stranger in this part of the world ; and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage ? had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately , it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging everything to me at once : but this is not the case . it is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun , for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance ; and even secrecy , as far as it can be observed , may now be very advisable . ”
austen	sense	they were interrupted by the entrance of margaret ; and elinor was then at liberty to think over the representations of her mother , to acknowledge the probability of many , and hope for the justice of all .
austen	sense	they saw nothing of marianne till dinner time , when she entered the room and took her place at the table without saying a word . her eyes were red and swollen ; and it seemed as if her tears were even then restrained with difficulty . she avoided the looks of them all , could neither eat nor speak , and after some time , on her mother ’ s silently pressing her hand with tender compassion , her small degree of fortitude was quite overcome , she burst into tears and left the room .
austen	sense	this violent oppression of spirits continued the whole evening . she was without any power , because she was without any desire of command over herself . the slightest mention of anything relative to willoughby overpowered her in an instant ; and though her family were most anxiously attentive to her comfort , it was impossible for them , if they spoke at all , to keep clear of every subject which her feelings connected with him .
austen	sense	chapter xvi . marianne would have thought herself very inexcusable had she been able to sleep at all the first night after parting from willoughby . she would have been ashamed to look her family in the face the next morning , had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose than when she lay down in it . but the feelings which made such composure a disgrace , left her in no danger of incurring it . she was awake the whole night , and she wept the greatest part of it . she got up with a headache , was unable to talk , and unwilling to take any nourishment ; giving pain every moment to her mother and sisters , and forbidding all attempt at consolation from either . her sensibility was potent enough !
austen	sense	when breakfast was over she walked out by herself , and wandered about the village of allenham , indulging the recollection of past enjoyment and crying over the present reverse for the chief of the morning .
austen	sense	the evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling . she played over every favourite song that she had been used to play to willoughby , every air in which their voices had been oftenest joined , and sat at the instrument gazing on every line of music that he had written out for her , till her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness could be gained ; and this nourishment of grief was every day applied . she spent whole hours at the pianoforte alternately singing and crying ; her voice often totally suspended by her tears . in books too , as well as in music , she courted the misery which a contrast between the past and present was certain of giving . she read nothing but what they had been used to read together .
austen	sense	such violence of affliction indeed could not be supported for ever ; it sunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy ; but these employments , to which she daily recurred , her solitary walks and silent meditations , still produced occasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever .
austen	sense	no letter from willoughby came ; and none seemed expected by marianne . her mother was surprised , and elinor again became uneasy . but mrs. dashwood could find explanations whenever she wanted them , which at least satisfied herself .
austen	sense	“ remember , elinor , ” said she , “ how very often sir john fetches our letters himself from the post , and carries them to it . we have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary , and we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through sir john ’ s hands . ”
austen	sense	elinor could not deny the truth of this , and she tried to find in it a motive sufficient for their silence . but there was one method so direct , so simple , and in her opinion so eligible of knowing the real state of the affair , and of instantly removing all mystery , that she could not help suggesting it to her mother .
austen	sense	“ why do you not ask marianne at once , ” said she , “ whether she is or she is not engaged to willoughby ? from you , her mother , and so kind , so indulgent a mother , the question could not give offence . it would be the natural result of your affection for her . she used to be all unreserve , and to you more especially . ”
austen	sense	“ i would not ask such a question for the world . supposing it possible that they are not engaged , what distress would not such an enquiry inflict ! at any rate it would be most ungenerous . i should never deserve her confidence again , after forcing from her a confession of what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one . i know marianne ’ s heart : i know that she dearly loves me , and that i shall not be the last to whom the affair is made known , when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible . i would not attempt to force the confidence of any one ; of a child much less ; because a sense of duty would prevent the denial which her wishes might direct . ”
austen	sense	elinor thought this generosity overstrained , considering her sister ’ s youth , and urged the matter farther , but in vain ; common sense , common care , common prudence , were all sunk in mrs. dashwood ’ s romantic delicacy .
austen	sense	it was several days before willoughby ’ s name was mentioned before marianne by any of her family ; sir john and mrs. jennings , indeed , were not so nice ; their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour ; —but one evening , mrs. dashwood , accidentally taking up a volume of shakespeare , exclaimed ,
austen	sense	“ we have never finished hamlet , marianne ; our dear willoughby went away before we could get through it . we will put it by , that when he comes again ... but it may be months , perhaps , before _that_ happens . ”
austen	sense	“ months ! ” cried marianne , with strong surprise . “ no—nor many weeks. ” mrs. dashwood was sorry for what she had said ; but it gave elinor pleasure , as it produced a reply from marianne so expressive of confidence in willoughby and knowledge of his intentions .
austen	sense	one morning , about a week after his leaving the country , marianne was prevailed on to join her sisters in their usual walk , instead of wandering away by herself . hitherto she had carefully avoided every companion in her rambles . if her sisters intended to walk on the downs , she directly stole away towards the lanes ; if they talked of the valley , she was as speedy in climbing the hills , and could never be found when the others set off . but at length she was secured by the exertions of elinor , who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion . they walked along the road through the valley , and chiefly in silence , for marianne ’ s _mind_ could not be controlled , and elinor , satisfied with gaining one point , would not then attempt more . beyond the entrance of the valley , where the country , though still rich , was less wild and more open , a long stretch of the road which they had travelled on first coming to barton , lay before them ; and on reaching that point , they stopped to look around them , and examine a prospect which formed the distance of their view from the cottage , from a spot which they had never happened to reach in any of their walks before .
austen	sense	amongst the objects in the scene , they soon discovered an animated one ; it was a man on horseback riding towards them . in a few minutes they could distinguish him to be a gentleman ; and in a moment afterwards marianne rapturously exclaimed ,
austen	sense	“ it is he ; it is indeed ; —i know it is ! ” —and was hastening to meet him , when elinor cried out , “ indeed , marianne , i think you are mistaken . it is not willoughby . the person is not tall enough for him , and has not his air . ”
austen	sense	“ he has , he has , ” cried marianne , “ i am sure he has . his air , his coat , his horse . i knew how soon he would come. ” she walked eagerly on as she spoke ; and elinor , to screen marianne from particularity , as she felt almost certain of its not being willoughby , quickened her pace and kept up with her . they were soon within thirty yards of the gentleman . marianne looked again ; her heart sunk within her ; and abruptly turning round , she was hurrying back , when the voices of both her sisters were raised to detain her ; a third , almost as well known as willoughby ’ s , joined them in begging her to stop , and she turned round with surprise to see and welcome edward ferrars .
austen	sense	he was the only person in the world who could at that moment be forgiven for not being willoughby ; the only one who could have gained a smile from her ; but she dispersed her tears to smile on _him_ , and in her sister ’ s happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment .
austen	sense	he dismounted , and giving his horse to his servant , walked back with them to barton , whither he was purposely coming to visit them . he was welcomed by them all with great cordiality , but especially by marianne , who showed more warmth of regard in her reception of him than even elinor herself . to marianne , indeed , the meeting between edward and her sister was but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness which she had often observed at norland in their mutual behaviour . on edward ’ s side , more particularly , there was a deficiency of all that a lover ought to look and say on such an occasion . he was confused , seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them , looked neither rapturous nor gay , said little but what was forced from him by questions , and distinguished elinor by no mark of affection . marianne saw and listened with increasing surprise . she began almost to feel a dislike of edward ; and it ended , as every feeling must end with her , by carrying back her thoughts to willoughby , whose manners formed a contrast sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect .
austen	sense	after a short silence which succeeded the first surprise and enquiries of meeting , marianne asked edward if he came directly from london . no , he had been in devonshire a fortnight .
austen	sense	“ a fortnight ! ” she repeated , surprised at his being so long in the same county with elinor without seeing her before . he looked rather distressed as he added , that he had been staying with some friends near plymouth .
austen	sense	“ have you been lately in sussex ? ” said elinor . “ i was at norland about a month ago. ” “ and how does dear , dear norland look ? ” cried marianne . “ dear , dear norland , ” said elinor , “ probably looks much as it always does at this time of the year . the woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves . ”
austen	sense	“ oh , ” cried marianne , “ with what transporting sensation have i formerly seen them fall ! how have i delighted , as i walked , to see them driven in showers about me by the wind ! what feelings have they , the season , the air altogether inspired ! now there is no one to regard them . they are seen only as a nuisance , swept hastily off , and driven as much as possible from the sight . ”
austen	sense	“ it is not every one , ” said elinor , “ who has your passion for dead leaves. ” “ no ; my feelings are not often shared , not often understood . but _sometimes_ they are. ” —as she said this , she sunk into a reverie for a few moments ; —but rousing herself again , “ now , edward , ” said she , calling his attention to the prospect , “ here is barton valley . look up to it , and be tranquil if you can . look at those hills ! did you ever see their equals ? to the left is barton park , amongst those woods and plantations . you may see the end of the house . and there , beneath that farthest hill , which rises with such grandeur , is our cottage . ”
austen	sense	“ it is a beautiful country , ” he replied ; “ but these bottoms must be dirty in winter. ” “ how can you think of dirt , with such objects before you ? ” “ because , ” replied he , smiling , “ among the rest of the objects before me , i see a very dirty lane . ”
austen	sense	“ how strange ! ” said marianne to herself as she walked on . “ have you an agreeable neighbourhood here ? are the middletons pleasant people ? ” “ no , not all , ” answered marianne ; “ we could not be more unfortunately situated . ”
austen	sense	“ marianne , ” cried her sister , “ how can you say so ? how can you be so unjust ? they are a very respectable family , mr. ferrars ; and towards us have behaved in the friendliest manner . have you forgot , marianne , how many pleasant days we have owed to them ? ”
austen	sense	“ no , ” said marianne , in a low voice , “ nor how many painful moments. ” elinor took no notice of this ; and directing her attention to their visitor , endeavoured to support something like discourse with him , by talking of their present residence , its conveniences , & c. extorting from him occasional questions and remarks . his coldness and reserve mortified her severely ; she was vexed and half angry ; but resolving to regulate her behaviour to him by the past rather than the present , she avoided every appearance of resentment or displeasure , and treated him as she thought he ought to be treated from the family connection .
austen	sense	chapter xvii . mrs. dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him ; for his coming to barton was , in her opinion , of all things the most natural . her joy and expression of regard long outlived her wonder . he received the kindest welcome from her ; and shyness , coldness , reserve could not stand against such a reception . they had begun to fail him before he entered the house , and they were quite overcome by the captivating manners of mrs. dashwood . indeed a man could not very well be in love with either of her daughters , without extending the passion to her ; and elinor had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself . his affections seemed to reanimate towards them all , and his interest in their welfare again became perceptible . he was not in spirits , however ; he praised their house , admired its prospect , was attentive , and kind ; but still he was not in spirits . the whole family perceived it , and mrs. dashwood , attributing it to some want of liberality in his mother , sat down to table indignant against all selfish parents .
austen	sense	“ what are mrs. ferrars ’ s views for you at present , edward ? ” said she , when dinner was over and they had drawn round the fire ; “ are you still to be a great orator in spite of yourself ? ”
austen	sense	“ no . i hope my mother is now convinced that i have no more talents than inclination for a public life ! ” “ but how is your fame to be established ? for famous you must be to satisfy all your family ; and with no inclination for expense , no affection for strangers , no profession , and no assurance , you may find it a difficult matter . ”
austen	sense	“ i shall not attempt it . i have no wish to be distinguished ; and have every reason to hope i never shall . thank heaven ! i can not be forced into genius and eloquence . ”
austen	sense	“ you have no ambition , i well know . your wishes are all moderate. ” “ as moderate as those of the rest of the world , i believe . i wish as well as every body else to be perfectly happy ; but , like every body else it must be in my own way . greatness will not make me so . ”
austen	sense	“ strange that it would ! ” cried marianne . “ what have wealth or grandeur to do with happiness ? ” “ grandeur has but little , ” said elinor , “ but wealth has much to do with it. ” “ elinor , for shame ! ” said marianne , “ money can only give happiness where there is nothing else to give it . beyond a competence , it can afford no real satisfaction , as far as mere self is concerned . ”
austen	sense	“ perhaps , ” said elinor , smiling , “ we may come to the same point . _your_ competence and _my_ wealth are very much alike , i dare say ; and without them , as the world goes now , we shall both agree that every kind of external comfort must be wanting . your ideas are only more noble than mine . come , what is your competence ? ”
austen	sense	“ about eighteen hundred or two thousand a year ; not more than _that_. ” elinor laughed . “ _two_ thousand a year ! _one_ is my wealth ! i guessed how it would end. ” “ and yet two thousand a-year is a very moderate income , ” said marianne . “ a family can not well be maintained on a smaller . i am sure i am not extravagant in my demands . a proper establishment of servants , a carriage , perhaps two , and hunters , can not be supported on less . ”
austen	sense	elinor smiled again , to hear her sister describing so accurately their future expenses at combe magna . “ hunters ! ” repeated edward— “ but why must you have hunters ? every body does not hunt. ” marianne coloured as she replied , “ but most people do . ”
austen	sense	“ i wish , ” said margaret , striking out a novel thought , “ that somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece ! ” “ oh that they would ! ” cried marianne , her eyes sparkling with animation , and her cheeks glowing with the delight of such imaginary happiness .
austen	sense	“ we are all unanimous in that wish , i suppose , ” said elinor , “ in spite of the insufficiency of wealth. ” “ oh dear ! ” cried margaret , “ how happy i should be ! i wonder what i should do with it ! ”
austen	sense	marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point . “ i should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself , ” said mrs. dashwood , “ if my children were all to be rich without my help . ”
austen	sense	“ you must begin your improvements on this house , ” observed elinor , “ and your difficulties will soon vanish. ” “ what magnificent orders would travel from this family to london , ” said edward , “ in such an event ! what a happy day for booksellers , music-sellers , and print-shops ! you , miss dashwood , would give a general commission for every new print of merit to be sent you—and as for marianne , i know her greatness of soul , there would not be music enough in london to content her . and books ! —thomson , cowper , scott—she would buy them all over and over again : she would buy up every copy , i believe , to prevent their falling into unworthy hands ; and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree . should not you , marianne ? forgive me , if i am very saucy . but i was willing to show you that i had not forgot our old disputes . ”
austen	sense	“ i love to be reminded of the past , edward—whether it be melancholy or gay , i love to recall it—and you will never offend me by talking of former times . you are very right in supposing how my money would be spent—some of it , at least—my loose cash would certainly be employed in improving my collection of music and books . ”
austen	sense	“ and the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the authors or their heirs. ” “ no , edward , i should have something else to do with it. ” “ perhaps , then , you would bestow it as a reward on that person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim , that no one can ever be in love more than once in their life—your opinion on that point is unchanged , i presume ? ”
austen	sense	“ undoubtedly . at my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed . it is not likely that i should now see or hear any thing to change them. ” “ marianne is as steadfast as ever , you see , ” said elinor , “ she is not at all altered . ”
austen	sense	“ she is only grown a little more grave than she was. ” “ nay , edward , ” said marianne , “ _you_ need not reproach me . you are not very gay yourself. ” “ why should you think so ! ” replied he , with a sigh . “ but gaiety never was a part of _my_ character . ”
austen	sense	“ nor do i think it a part of marianne ’ s , ” said elinor ; “ i should hardly call her a lively girl—she is very earnest , very eager in all she does—sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation—but she is not often really merry . ”
austen	sense	“ i believe you are right , ” he replied , “ and yet i have always set her down as a lively girl. ” “ i have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes , ” said elinor , “ in a total misapprehension of character in some point or other : fancying people so much more gay or grave , or ingenious or stupid than they really are , and i can hardly tell why or in what the deception originated . sometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves , and very frequently by what other people say of them , without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge . ”
austen	sense	“ but i thought it was right , elinor , ” said marianne , “ to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people . i thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours . this has always been your doctrine , i am sure . ”
austen	sense	“ no , marianne , never . my doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of the understanding . all i have ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour . you must not confound my meaning . i am guilty , i confess , of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with greater attention ; but when have i advised you to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters ? ”
austen	sense	“ you have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of general civility , ” said edward to elinor , “ do you gain no ground ? ” “ quite the contrary , ” replied elinor , looking expressively at marianne .
austen	sense	“ my judgment , ” he returned , “ is all on your side of the question ; but i am afraid my practice is much more on your sister ’ s . i never wish to offend , but i am so foolishly shy , that i often seem negligent , when i am only kept back by my natural awkwardness . i have frequently thought that i must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company , i am so little at my ease among strangers of gentility ! ”
austen	sense	“ marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers , ” said elinor . “ she knows her own worth too well for false shame , ” replied edward . “ shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or other . if i could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful , i should not be shy . ”
austen	sense	“ but you would still be reserved , ” said marianne , “ and that is worse. ” edward started— “ reserved ! am i reserved , marianne ? ” “ yes , very. ” “ i do not understand you , ” replied he , colouring . “ reserved ! —how , in what manner ? what am i to tell you ? what can you suppose ? ”
austen	sense	elinor looked surprised at his emotion ; but trying to laugh off the subject , she said to him , “ do not you know my sister well enough to understand what she means ? do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast , and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself ? ”
austen	sense	edward made no answer . his gravity and thoughtfulness returned on him in their fullest extent—and he sat for some time silent and dull . chapter xviii . elinor saw , with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend . his visit afforded her but a very partial satisfaction , while his own enjoyment in it appeared so imperfect . it was evident that he was unhappy ; she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguished her by the same affection which once she had felt no doubt of inspiring ; but hitherto the continuance of his preference seemed very uncertain ; and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one .
austen	sense	he joined her and marianne in the breakfast-room the next morning before the others were down ; and marianne , who was always eager to promote their happiness as far as she could , soon left them to themselves . but before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlour door open , and , turning round , was astonished to see edward himself come out .
austen	sense	“ i am going into the village to see my horses , ” said he , “ as you are not yet ready for breakfast ; i shall be back again presently. ” edward returned to them with fresh admiration of the surrounding country ; in his walk to the village , he had seen many parts of the valley to advantage ; and the village itself , in a much higher situation than the cottage , afforded a general view of the whole , which had exceedingly pleased him . this was a subject which ensured marianne ’ s attention , and she was beginning to describe her own admiration of these scenes , and to question him more minutely on the objects that had particularly struck him , when edward interrupted her by saying , “ you must not enquire too far , marianne—remember i have no knowledge in the picturesque , and i shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars . i shall call hills steep , which ought to be bold ; surfaces strange and uncouth , which ought to be irregular and rugged ; and distant objects out of sight , which ought only to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere . you must be satisfied with such admiration as i can honestly give . i call it a very fine country—the hills are steep , the woods seem full of fine timber , and the valley looks comfortable and snug—with rich meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here and there . it exactly answers my idea of a fine country , because it unites beauty with utility—and i dare say it is a picturesque one too , because you admire it ; i can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories , grey moss and brush wood , but these are all lost on me . i know nothing of the picturesque . ”
austen	sense	“ i am afraid it is but too true , ” said marianne ; “ but why should you boast of it ? ” “ i suspect , ” said elinor , “ that to avoid one kind of affectation , edward here falls into another . because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel , and is disgusted with such pretensions , he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses . he is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own . ”
austen	sense	“ it is very true , ” said marianne , “ that admiration of landscape scenery is become a mere jargon . every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what picturesque beauty was . i detest jargon of every kind , and sometimes i have kept my feelings to myself , because i could find no language to describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning . ”
austen	sense	“ i am convinced , ” said edward , “ that you really feel all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess to feel . but , in return , your sister must allow me to feel no more than i profess . i like a fine prospect , but not on picturesque principles . i do not like crooked , twisted , blasted trees . i admire them much more if they are tall , straight , and flourishing . i do not like ruined , tattered cottages . i am not fond of nettles or thistles , or heath blossoms . i have more pleasure in a snug farm-house than a watch-tower—and a troop of tidy , happy villagers please me better than the finest banditti in the world . ”
austen	sense	marianne looked with amazement at edward , with compassion at her sister . elinor only laughed . the subject was continued no farther ; and marianne remained thoughtfully silent , till a new object suddenly engaged her attention . she was sitting by edward , and in taking his tea from mrs. dashwood , his hand passed so directly before her , as to make a ring , with a plait of hair in the centre , very conspicuous on one of his fingers .
austen	sense	“ i never saw you wear a ring before , edward , ” she cried . “ is that fanny ’ s hair ? i remember her promising to give you some . but i should have thought her hair had been darker . ”
austen	sense	marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt—but when she saw how much she had pained edward , her own vexation at her want of thought could not be surpassed by his . he coloured very deeply , and giving a momentary glance at elinor , replied , “ yes ; it is my sister ’ s hair . the setting always casts a different shade on it , you know . ”
austen	sense	elinor had met his eye , and looked conscious likewise . that the hair was her own , she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as marianne ; the only difference in their conclusions was , that what marianne considered as a free gift from her sister , elinor was conscious must have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself . she was not in a humour , however , to regard it as an affront , and affecting to take no notice of what passed , by instantly talking of something else , she internally resolved henceforward to catch every opportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself , beyond all doubt , that it was exactly the shade of her own .
austen	sense	edward ’ s embarrassment lasted some time , and it ended in an absence of mind still more settled . he was particularly grave the whole morning . marianne severely censured herself for what she had said ; but her own forgiveness might have been more speedy , had she known how little offence it had given her sister .
austen	sense	before the middle of the day , they were visited by sir john and mrs. jennings , who , having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at the cottage , came to take a survey of the guest . with the assistance of his mother-in-law , sir john was not long in discovering that the name of ferrars began with an f. and this prepared a future mine of raillery against the devoted elinor , which nothing but the newness of their acquaintance with edward could have prevented from being immediately sprung . but , as it was , she only learned , from some very significant looks , how far their penetration , founded on margaret ’ s instructions , extended .
austen	sense	sir john never came to the dashwoods without either inviting them to dine at the park the next day , or to drink tea with them that evening . on the present occasion , for the better entertainment of their visitor , towards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute , he wished to engage them for both .
austen	sense	“ you _must_ drink tea with us to night , ” said he , “ for we shall be quite alone—and tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us , for we shall be a large party . ”
austen	sense	mrs. jennings enforced the necessity . “ and who knows but you may raise a dance , ” said she . “ and that will tempt _you_ , miss marianne. ” “ a dance ! ” cried marianne . “ impossible ! who is to dance ? ”
austen	sense	“ who ! why yourselves , and the careys , and whitakers to be sure.—what ! you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be nameless is gone ! ” “ i wish with all my soul , ” cried sir john , “ that willoughby were among us again . ”
austen	sense	this , and marianne ’ s blushing , gave new suspicions to edward . “ and who is willoughby ? ” said he , in a low voice , to miss dashwood , by whom he was sitting . she gave him a brief reply . marianne ’ s countenance was more communicative . edward saw enough to comprehend , not only the meaning of others , but such of marianne ’ s expressions as had puzzled him before ; and when their visitors left them , he went immediately round her , and said , in a whisper , “ i have been guessing . shall i tell you my guess ? ”
austen	sense	“ what do you mean ? ” “ shall i tell you ? ” “ certainly. ” “ well then ; i guess that mr. willoughby hunts. ” marianne was surprised and confused , yet she could not help smiling at the quiet archness of his manner , and after a moment ’ s silence , said ,
austen	sense	“ oh , edward ! how can you ? —but the time will come i hope ... i am sure you will like him. ” “ i do not doubt it , ” replied he , rather astonished at her earnestness and warmth ; for had he not imagined it to be a joke for the good of her acquaintance in general , founded only on a something or a nothing between mr. willoughby and herself , he would not have ventured to mention it .
austen	sense	chapter xix . edward remained a week at the cottage ; he was earnestly pressed by mrs. dashwood to stay longer ; but , as if he were bent only on self-mortification , he seemed resolved to be gone when his enjoyment among his friends was at the height . his spirits , during the last two or three days , though still very unequal , were greatly improved—he grew more and more partial to the house and environs—never spoke of going away without a sigh—declared his time to be wholly disengaged—even doubted to what place he should go when he left them—but still , go he must . never had any week passed so quickly—he could hardly believe it to be gone . he said so repeatedly ; other things he said too , which marked the turn of his feelings and gave the lie to his actions . he had no pleasure at norland ; he detested being in town ; but either to norland or london , he must go . he valued their kindness beyond any thing , and his greatest happiness was in being with them . yet , he must leave them at the end of a week , in spite of their wishes and his own , and without any restraint on his time .
austen	sense	elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his mother ’ s account ; and it was happy for her that he had a mother whose character was so imperfectly known to her , as to be the general excuse for every thing strange on the part of her son . disappointed , however , and vexed as she was , and sometimes displeased with his uncertain behaviour to herself , she was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications , which had been rather more painfully extorted from her , for willoughby ’ s service , by her mother . his want of spirits , of openness , and of consistency , were most usually attributed to his want of independence , and his better knowledge of mrs. ferrars ’ s disposition and designs . the shortness of his visit , the steadiness of his purpose in leaving them , originated in the same fettered inclination , the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother . the old well-established grievance of duty against will , parent against child , was the cause of all . she would have been glad to know when these difficulties were to cease , this opposition was to yield , —when mrs. ferrars would be reformed , and her son be at liberty to be happy . but from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort to the renewal of her confidence in edward ’ s affection , to the remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word which fell from him while at barton , and above all to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore round his finger .
austen	sense	“ i think , edward , ” said mrs. dashwood , as they were at breakfast the last morning , “ you would be a happier man if you had any profession to engage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions . some inconvenience to your friends , indeed , might result from it—you would not be able to give them so much of your time . but ( with a smile ) you would be materially benefited in one particular at least—you would know where to go when you left them . ”
austen	sense	“ i do assure you , ” he replied , “ that i have long thought on this point , as you think now . it has been , and is , and probably will always be a heavy misfortune to me , that i have had no necessary business to engage me , no profession to give me employment , or afford me any thing like independence . but unfortunately my own nicety , and the nicety of my friends , have made me what i am , an idle , helpless being . we never could agree in our choice of a profession . i always preferred the church , as i still do . but that was not smart enough for my family . they recommended the army . that was a great deal too smart for me . the law was allowed to be genteel enough ; many young men , who had chambers in the temple , made a very good appearance in the first circles , and drove about town in very knowing gigs . but i had no inclination for the law , even in this less abstruse study of it , which my family approved . as for the navy , it had fashion on its side , but i was too old when the subject was first started to enter it—and , at length , as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all , as i might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as with one , idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable , and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his friends to do nothing . i was therefore entered at oxford and have been properly idle ever since . ”
austen	sense	“ the consequence of which , i suppose , will be , ” said mrs. dashwood , “ since leisure has not promoted your own happiness , that your sons will be brought up to as many pursuits , employments , professions , and trades as columella ’ s . ”
austen	sense	“ they will be brought up , ” said he , in a serious accent , “ to be as unlike myself as is possible . in feeling , in action , in condition , in every thing. ” “ come , come ; this is all an effusion of immediate want of spirits , edward . you are in a melancholy humour , and fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy . but remember that the pain of parting from friends will be felt by every body at times , whatever be their education or state . know your own happiness . you want nothing but patience—or give it a more fascinating name , call it hope . your mother will secure to you , in time , that independence you are so anxious for ; it is her duty , and it will , it must ere long become her happiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent . how much may not a few months do ? ”
austen	sense	“ i think , ” replied edward , “ that i may defy many months to produce any good to me. ” this desponding turn of mind , though it could not be communicated to mrs. dashwood , gave additional pain to them all in the parting , which shortly took place , and left an uncomfortable impression on elinor ’ s feelings especially , which required some trouble and time to subdue . but as it was her determination to subdue it , and to prevent herself from appearing to suffer more than what all her family suffered on his going away , she did not adopt the method so judiciously employed by marianne , on a similar occasion , to augment and fix her sorrow , by seeking silence , solitude and idleness . their means were as different as their objects , and equally suited to the advancement of each .
austen	sense	elinor sat down to her drawing-table as soon as he was out of the house , busily employed herself the whole day , neither sought nor avoided the mention of his name , appeared to interest herself almost as much as ever in the general concerns of the family , and if , by this conduct , she did not lessen her own grief , it was at least prevented from unnecessary increase , and her mother and sisters were spared much solicitude on her account .
austen	sense	such behaviour as this , so exactly the reverse of her own , appeared no more meritorious to marianne , than her own had seemed faulty to her . the business of self-command she settled very easily ; —with strong affections it was impossible , with calm ones it could have no merit . that her sister ’ s affections _were_ calm , she dared not deny , though she blushed to acknowledge it ; and of the strength of her own , she gave a very striking proof , by still loving and respecting that sister , in spite of this mortifying conviction .
austen	sense	without shutting herself up from her family , or leaving the house in determined solitude to avoid them , or lying awake the whole night to indulge meditation , elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough to think of edward , and of edward ’ s behaviour , in every possible variety which the different state of her spirits at different times could produce , —with tenderness , pity , approbation , censure , and doubt . there were moments in abundance , when , if not by the absence of her mother and sisters , at least by the nature of their employments , conversation was forbidden among them , and every effect of solitude was produced . her mind was inevitably at liberty ; her thoughts could not be chained elsewhere ; and the past and the future , on a subject so interesting , must be before her , must force her attention , and engross her memory , her reflection , and her fancy .
austen	sense	from a reverie of this kind , as she sat at her drawing-table , she was roused one morning , soon after edward ’ s leaving them , by the arrival of company . she happened to be quite alone . the closing of the little gate , at the entrance of the green court in front of the house , drew her eyes to the window , and she saw a large party walking up to the door . amongst them were sir john and lady middleton and mrs. jennings , but there were two others , a gentleman and lady , who were quite unknown to her . she was sitting near the window , and as soon as sir john perceived her , he left the rest of the party to the ceremony of knocking at the door , and stepping across the turf , obliged her to open the casement to speak to him , though the space was so short between the door and the window , as to make it hardly possible to speak at one without being heard at the other .
austen	sense	“ well , ” said he , “ we have brought you some strangers . how do you like them ? ” “ hush ! they will hear you. ” “ never mind if they do . it is only the palmers . charlotte is very pretty , i can tell you . you may see her if you look this way . ”
austen	sense	as elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple of minutes , without taking that liberty , she begged to be excused . “ where is marianne ? has she run away because we are come ? i see her instrument is open . ”
austen	sense	“ she is walking , i believe. ” they were now joined by mrs. jennings , who had not patience enough to wait till the door was opened before she told _her_ story . she came hallooing to the window , “ how do you do , my dear ? how does mrs. dashwood do ? and where are your sisters ? what ! all alone ! you will be glad of a little company to sit with you . i have brought my other son and daughter to see you . only think of their coming so suddenly ! i thought i heard a carriage last night , while we were drinking our tea , but it never entered my head that it could be them . i thought of nothing but whether it might not be colonel brandon come back again ; so i said to sir john , i do think i hear a carriage ; perhaps it is colonel brandon come back again— ”
austen	sense	elinor was obliged to turn from her , in the middle of her story , to receive the rest of the party ; lady middleton introduced the two strangers ; mrs. dashwood and margaret came down stairs at the same time , and they all sat down to look at one another , while mrs. jennings continued her story as she walked through the passage into the parlour , attended by sir john .
austen	sense	mrs. palmer was several years younger than lady middleton , and totally unlike her in every respect . she was short and plump , had a very pretty face , and the finest expression of good humour in it that could possibly be . her manners were by no means so elegant as her sister ’ s , but they were much more prepossessing . she came in with a smile , smiled all the time of her visit , except when she laughed , and smiled when she went away . her husband was a grave looking young man of five or six and twenty , with an air of more fashion and sense than his wife , but of less willingness to please or be pleased . he entered the room with a look of self-consequence , slightly bowed to the ladies , without speaking a word , and , after briefly surveying them and their apartments , took up a newspaper from the table , and continued to read it as long as he staid .
austen	sense	mrs. palmer , on the contrary , who was strongly endowed by nature with a turn for being uniformly civil and happy , was hardly seated before her admiration of the parlour and every thing in it burst forth .
austen	sense	“ well ! what a delightful room this is ! i never saw anything so charming ! only think , mama , how it is improved since i was here last ! i always thought it such a sweet place , ma ’ am ! ( turning to mrs. dashwood ) but you have made it so charming ! only look , sister , how delightful every thing is ! how i should like such a house for myself ! should not you , mr. palmer ? ”
austen	sense	mr. palmer made her no answer , and did not even raise his eyes from the newspaper . “ mr . palmer does not hear me , ” said she , laughing ; “ he never does sometimes . it is so ridiculous ! ”
austen	sense	this was quite a new idea to mrs. dashwood ; she had never been used to find wit in the inattention of any one , and could not help looking with surprise at them both .
austen	sense	mrs. jennings , in the meantime , talked on as loud as she could , and continued her account of their surprise , the evening before , on seeing their friends , without ceasing till every thing was told . mrs. palmer laughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment , and every body agreed , two or three times over , that it had been quite an agreeable surprise .
austen	sense	“ you may believe how glad we all were to see them , ” added mrs. jennings , leaning forward towards elinor , and speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard by no one else , though they were seated on different sides of the room ; “ but , however , i can ’ t help wishing they had not travelled quite so fast , nor made such a long journey of it , for they came all round by london upon account of some business , for you know ( nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter ) it was wrong in her situation . i wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning , but she would come with us ; she longed so much to see you all ! ”
austen	sense	mrs. palmer laughed , and said it would not do her any harm . “ she expects to be confined in february , ” continued mrs. jennings . lady middleton could no longer endure such a conversation , and therefore exerted herself to ask mr. palmer if there was any news in the paper .
austen	sense	“ no , none at all , ” he replied , and read on . “ here comes marianne , ” cried sir john . “ now , palmer , you shall see a monstrous pretty girl. ” he immediately went into the passage , opened the front door , and ushered her in himself . mrs. jennings asked her , as soon as she appeared , if she had not been to allenham ; and mrs. palmer laughed so heartily at the question , as to show she understood it . mr. palmer looked up on her entering the room , stared at her some minutes , and then returned to his newspaper . mrs. palmer ’ s eye was now caught by the drawings which hung round the room . she got up to examine them .
austen	sense	“ oh ! dear , how beautiful these are ! well ! how delightful ! do but look , mama , how sweet ! i declare they are quite charming ; i could look at them for ever. ” and then sitting down again , she very soon forgot that there were any such things in the room .
austen	sense	when lady middleton rose to go away , mr. palmer rose also , laid down the newspaper , stretched himself and looked at them all around . “ my love , have you been asleep ? ” said his wife , laughing .
austen	sense	he made her no answer ; and only observed , after again examining the room , that it was very low pitched , and that the ceiling was crooked . he then made his bow , and departed with the rest .
austen	sense	sir john had been very urgent with them all to spend the next day at the park . mrs. dashwood , who did not chuse to dine with them oftener than they dined at the cottage , absolutely refused on her own account ; her daughters might do as they pleased . but they had no curiosity to see how mr. and mrs. palmer ate their dinner , and no expectation of pleasure from them in any other way . they attempted , therefore , likewise , to excuse themselves ; the weather was uncertain , and not likely to be good . but sir john would not be satisfied—the carriage should be sent for them and they must come . lady middleton too , though she did not press their mother , pressed them . mrs. jennings and mrs. palmer joined their entreaties , all seemed equally anxious to avoid a family party ; and the young ladies were obliged to yield .
austen	sense	“ why should they ask us ? ” said marianne , as soon as they were gone . “ the rent of this cottage is said to be low ; but we have it on very hard terms , if we are to dine at the park whenever any one is staying either with them , or with us . ”
austen	sense	“ they mean no less to be civil and kind to us now , ” said elinor , “ by these frequent invitations , than by those which we received from them a few weeks ago . the alteration is not in them , if their parties are grown tedious and dull . we must look for the change elsewhere . ”
austen	sense	chapter xx . as the miss dashwoods entered the drawing-room of the park the next day , at one door , mrs. palmer came running in at the other , looking as good humoured and merry as before . she took them all most affectionately by the hand , and expressed great delight in seeing them again .
austen	sense	“ i am so glad to see you ! ” said she , seating herself between elinor and marianne , “ for it is so bad a day i was afraid you might not come , which would be a shocking thing , as we go away again tomorrow . we must go , for the westons come to us next week you know . it was quite a sudden thing our coming at all , and i knew nothing of it till the carriage was coming to the door , and then mr. palmer asked me if i would go with him to barton . he is so droll ! he never tells me any thing ! i am so sorry we can not stay longer ; however we shall meet again in town very soon , i hope . ”
austen	sense	they were obliged to put an end to such an expectation . “ not go to town ! ” cried mrs. palmer , with a laugh , “ i shall be quite disappointed if you do not . i could get the nicest house in the world for you , next door to ours , in hanover-square . you must come , indeed . i am sure i shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till i am confined , if mrs. dashwood should not like to go into public . ”
austen	sense	they thanked her ; but were obliged to resist all her entreaties . “ oh , my love , ” cried mrs. palmer to her husband , who just then entered the room— “ you must help me to persuade the miss dashwoods to go to town this winter . ”
austen	sense	her love made no answer ; and after slightly bowing to the ladies , began complaining of the weather . “ how horrid all this is ! ” said he . “ such weather makes every thing and every body disgusting . dullness is as much produced within doors as without , by rain . it makes one detest all one ’ s acquaintance . what the devil does sir john mean by not having a billiard room in his house ? how few people know what comfort is ! sir john is as stupid as the weather . ”
austen	sense	the rest of the company soon dropt in . “ i am afraid , miss marianne , ” said sir john , “ you have not been able to take your usual walk to allenham today. ” marianne looked very grave and said nothing .
austen	sense	“ oh , don ’ t be so sly before us , ” said mrs. palmer ; “ for we know all about it , i assure you ; and i admire your taste very much , for i think he is extremely handsome . we do not live a great way from him in the country , you know . not above ten miles , i dare say . ”
austen	sense	“ much nearer thirty , ” said her husband . “ ah , well ! there is not much difference . i never was at his house ; but they say it is a sweet pretty place. ” “ as vile a spot as i ever saw in my life , ” said mr. palmer .
austen	sense	marianne remained perfectly silent , though her countenance betrayed her interest in what was said . “ is it very ugly ? ” continued mrs. palmer— “ then it must be some other place that is so pretty i suppose . ”
austen	sense	when they were seated in the dining room , sir john observed with regret that they were only eight all together . “ my dear , ” said he to his lady , “ it is very provoking that we should be so few . why did not you ask the gilberts to come to us today ? ”
austen	sense	“ did not i tell you , sir john , when you spoke to me about it before , that it could not be done ? they dined with us last. ” “ you and i , sir john , ” said mrs. jennings , “ should not stand upon such ceremony . ”
austen	sense	“ then you would be very ill-bred , ” cried mr. palmer . “ my love you contradict every body , ” said his wife with her usual laugh . “ do you know that you are quite rude ? ”
austen	sense	“ i did not know i contradicted any body in calling your mother ill-bred. ” “ ay , you may abuse me as you please , ” said the good-natured old lady , “ you have taken charlotte off my hands , and can not give her back again . so there i have the whip hand of you . ”
austen	sense	charlotte laughed heartily to think that her husband could not get rid of her ; and exultingly said , she did not care how cross he was to her , as they must live together . it was impossible for any one to be more thoroughly good-natured , or more determined to be happy than mrs. palmer . the studied indifference , insolence , and discontent of her husband gave her no pain ; and when he scolded or abused her , she was highly diverted .
austen	sense	“ mr . palmer is so droll ! ” said she , in a whisper , to elinor . “ he is always out of humour. ” elinor was not inclined , after a little observation , to give him credit for being so genuinely and unaffectedly ill-natured or ill-bred as he wished to appear . his temper might perhaps be a little soured by finding , like many others of his sex , that through some unaccountable bias in favour of beauty , he was the husband of a very silly woman—but she knew that this kind of blunder was too common for any sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it . it was rather a wish of distinction , she believed , which produced his contemptuous treatment of every body , and his general abuse of every thing before him . it was the desire of appearing superior to other people . the motive was too common to be wondered at ; but the means , however they might succeed by establishing his superiority in ill-breeding , were not likely to attach any one to him except his wife .
austen	sense	“ oh , my dear miss dashwood , ” said mrs. palmer soon afterwards , “ i have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister . will you come and spend some time at cleveland this christmas ? now , pray do , —and come while the westons are with us . you can not think how happy i shall be ! it will be quite delightful ! —my love , ” applying to her husband , “ don ’ t you long to have the miss dashwoods come to cleveland ? ”
austen	sense	“ certainly , ” he replied , with a sneer— “ i came into devonshire with no other view. ” “ there now , ” —said his lady , “ you see mr. palmer expects you ; so you can not refuse to come. ” they both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation .
austen	sense	“ but indeed you must and shall come . i am sure you will like it of all things . the westons will be with us , and it will be quite delightful . you can not think what a sweet place cleveland is ; and we are so gay now , for mr. palmer is always going about the country canvassing against the election ; and so many people came to dine with us that i never saw before , it is quite charming ! but , poor fellow ! it is very fatiguing to him ! for he is forced to make every body like him . ”
austen	sense	elinor could hardly keep her countenance as she assented to the hardship of such an obligation . “ how charming it will be , ” said charlotte , “ when he is in parliament ! —won ’ t it ? how i shall laugh ! it will be so ridiculous to see all his letters directed to him with an m.p.—but do you know , he says , he will never frank for me ? he declares he won ’ t . don ’ t you , mr. palmer ? ”
austen	sense	mr. palmer took no notice of her . “ he can not bear writing , you know , ” she continued— “ he says it is quite shocking. ” “ no , ” said he , “ i never said any thing so irrational . don ’ t palm all your abuses of language upon me . ”
austen	sense	“ there now ; you see how droll he is . this is always the way with him ! sometimes he won ’ t speak to me for half a day together , and then he comes out with something so droll—all about any thing in the world . ”
austen	sense	she surprised elinor very much as they returned into the drawing-room , by asking her whether she did not like mr. palmer excessively . “ certainly , ” said elinor ; “ he seems very agreeable. ” “ well—i am so glad you do . i thought you would , he is so pleasant ; and mr. palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters i can tell you , and you can ’ t think how disappointed he will be if you don ’ t come to cleveland.—i can ’ t imagine why you should object to it . ”
austen	sense	elinor was again obliged to decline her invitation ; and by changing the subject , put a stop to her entreaties . she thought it probable that as they lived in the same county , mrs. palmer might be able to give some more particular account of willoughby ’ s general character , than could be gathered from the middletons ’ partial acquaintance with him ; and she was eager to gain from any one , such a confirmation of his merits as might remove the possibility of fear from marianne . she began by inquiring if they saw much of mr. willoughby at cleveland , and whether they were intimately acquainted with him .
austen	sense	“ oh dear , yes ; i know him extremely well , ” replied mrs. palmer ; — “ not that i ever spoke to him , indeed ; but i have seen him for ever in town . somehow or other i never happened to be staying at barton while he was at allenham . mama saw him here once before ; —but i was with my uncle at weymouth . however , i dare say we should have seen a great deal of him in somersetshire , if it had not happened very unluckily that we should never have been in the country together . he is very little at combe , i believe ; but if he were ever so much there , i do not think mr. palmer would visit him , for he is in the opposition , you know , and besides it is such a way off . i know why you inquire about him , very well ; your sister is to marry him . i am monstrous glad of it , for then i shall have her for a neighbour you know . ”
austen	sense	“ upon my word , ” replied elinor , “ you know much more of the matter than i do , if you have any reason to expect such a match. ” “ don ’ t pretend to deny it , because you know it is what every body talks of . i assure you i heard of it in my way through town . ”
austen	sense	“ my dear mrs. palmer ! ” “ upon my honour i did.—i met colonel brandon monday morning in bond-street , just before we left town , and he told me of it directly. ” “ you surprise me very much . colonel brandon tell you of it ! surely you must be mistaken . to give such intelligence to a person who could not be interested in it , even if it were true , is not what i should expect colonel brandon to do . ”
austen	sense	“ but i do assure you it was so , for all that , and i will tell you how it happened . when we met him , he turned back and walked with us ; and so we began talking of my brother and sister , and one thing and another , and i said to him , ‘ so , colonel , there is a new family come to barton cottage , i hear , and mama sends me word they are very pretty , and that one of them is going to be married to mr. willoughby of combe magna . is it true , pray ? for of course you must know , as you have been in devonshire so lately . ’ ”
austen	sense	“ and what did the colonel say ? ” “ oh—he did not say much ; but he looked as if he knew it to be true , so from that moment i set it down as certain . it will be quite delightful , i declare ! when is it to take place ? ”
austen	sense	“ mr . brandon was very well i hope ? ” “ oh ! yes , quite well ; and so full of your praises , he did nothing but say fine things of you. ” “ i am flattered by his commendation . he seems an excellent man ; and i think him uncommonly pleasing . ”
austen	sense	“ so do i . he is such a charming man , that it is quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull . mama says _he_ was in love with your sister too . i assure you it was a great compliment if he was , for he hardly ever falls in love with any body . ”
austen	sense	“ is mr. willoughby much known in your part of somersetshire ? ” said elinor . “ oh ! yes , extremely well ; that is , i do not believe many people are acquainted with him , because combe magna is so far off ; but they all think him extremely agreeable i assure you . nobody is more liked than mr. willoughby wherever he goes , and so you may tell your sister . she is a monstrous lucky girl to get him , upon my honour ; not but that he is much more lucky in getting her , because she is so very handsome and agreeable , that nothing can be good enough for her . however , i don ’ t think her hardly at all handsomer than you , i assure you ; for i think you both excessively pretty , and so does mr. palmer too i am sure , though we could not get him to own it last night . ”
austen	sense	mrs. palmer ’ s information respecting willoughby was not very material ; but any testimony in his favour , however small , was pleasing to her . “ i am so glad we are got acquainted at last , ” continued charlotte.— “ and now i hope we shall always be great friends . you can ’ t think how much i longed to see you ! it is so delightful that you should live at the cottage ! nothing can be like it , to be sure ! and i am so glad your sister is going to be well married ! i hope you will be a great deal at combe magna . it is a sweet place , by all accounts . ”
austen	sense	“ you have been long acquainted with colonel brandon , have not you ? ” “ yes , a great while ; ever since my sister married . he was a particular friend of sir john ’ s . i believe , ” she added in a low voice , “ he would have been very glad to have had me , if he could . sir john and lady middleton wished it very much . but mama did not think the match good enough for me , otherwise sir john would have mentioned it to the colonel , and we should have been married immediately . ”
austen	sense	“ did not colonel brandon know of sir john ’ s proposal to your mother before it was made ? had he never owned his affection to yourself ? ” “ oh , no ; but if mama had not objected to it , i dare say he would have liked it of all things . he had not seen me then above twice , for it was before i left school . however , i am much happier as i am . mr. palmer is the kind of man i like . ”
austen	sense	chapter xxi . the palmers returned to cleveland the next day , and the two families at barton were again left to entertain each other . but this did not last long ; elinor had hardly got their last visitors out of her head , had hardly done wondering at charlotte ’ s being so happy without a cause , at mr. palmer ’ s acting so simply , with good abilities , and at the strange unsuitableness which often existed between husband and wife , before sir john ’ s and mrs. jennings ’ s active zeal in the cause of society , procured her some other new acquaintance to see and observe .
austen	sense	in a morning ’ s excursion to exeter , they had met with two young ladies , whom mrs. jennings had the satisfaction of discovering to be her relations , and this was enough for sir john to invite them directly to the park , as soon as their present engagements at exeter were over . their engagements at exeter instantly gave way before such an invitation , and lady middleton was thrown into no little alarm on the return of sir john , by hearing that she was very soon to receive a visit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life , and of whose elegance , —whose tolerable gentility even , she could have no proof ; for the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went for nothing at all . their being her relations too made it so much the worse ; and mrs. jennings ’ s attempts at consolation were therefore unfortunately founded , when she advised her daughter not to care about their being so fashionable ; because they were all cousins and must put up with one another . as it was impossible , however , now to prevent their coming , lady middleton resigned herself to the idea of it , with all the philosophy of a well-bred woman , contenting herself with merely giving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject five or six times every day .
austen	sense	the young ladies arrived : their appearance was by no means ungenteel or unfashionable . their dress was very smart , their manners very civil , they were delighted with the house , and in raptures with the furniture , and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children that lady middleton ’ s good opinion was engaged in their favour before they had been an hour at the park . she declared them to be very agreeable girls indeed , which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration . sir john ’ s confidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise , and he set off directly for the cottage to tell the miss dashwoods of the miss steeles ’ arrival , and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls in the world . from such commendation as this , however , there was not much to be learned ; elinor well knew that the sweetest girls in the world were to be met with in every part of england , under every possible variation of form , face , temper and understanding . sir john wanted the whole family to walk to the park directly and look at his guests . benevolent , philanthropic man ! it was painful to him even to keep a third cousin to himself .
austen	sense	“ do come now , ” said he— “ pray come—you must come—i declare you shall come—you can ’ t think how you will like them . lucy is monstrous pretty , and so good humoured and agreeable ! the children are all hanging about her already , as if she was an old acquaintance . and they both long to see you of all things , for they have heard at exeter that you are the most beautiful creatures in the world ; and i have told them it is all very true , and a great deal more . you will be delighted with them i am sure . they have brought the whole coach full of playthings for the children . how can you be so cross as not to come ? why they are your cousins , you know , after a fashion . _you_ are my cousins , and they are my wife ’ s , so you must be related . ”
austen	sense	but sir john could not prevail . he could only obtain a promise of their calling at the park within a day or two , and then left them in amazement at their indifference , to walk home and boast anew of their attractions to the miss steeles , as he had been already boasting of the miss steeles to them .
austen	sense	when their promised visit to the park and consequent introduction to these young ladies took place , they found in the appearance of the eldest , who was nearly thirty , with a very plain and not a sensible face , nothing to admire ; but in the other , who was not more than two or three and twenty , they acknowledged considerable beauty ; her features were pretty , and she had a sharp quick eye , and a smartness of air , which though it did not give actual elegance or grace , gave distinction to her person . their manners were particularly civil , and elinor soon allowed them credit for some kind of sense , when she saw with what constant and judicious attention they were making themselves agreeable to lady middleton . with her children they were in continual raptures , extolling their beauty , courting their notice , and humouring their whims ; and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate demands which this politeness made on it , was spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing , if she happened to be doing any thing , or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress , in which her appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight . fortunately for those who pay their court through such foibles , a fond mother , though , in pursuit of praise for her children , the most rapacious of human beings , is likewise the most credulous ; her demands are exorbitant ; but she will swallow any thing ; and the excessive affection and endurance of the miss steeles towards her offspring were viewed therefore by lady middleton without the smallest surprise or distrust . she saw with maternal complacency all the impertinent encroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted . she saw their sashes untied , their hair pulled about their ears , their work-bags searched , and their knives and scissors stolen away , and felt no doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment . it suggested no other surprise than that elinor and marianne should sit so composedly by , without claiming a share in what was passing .
austen	sense	“ john is in such spirits today ! ” said she , on his taking miss steeles ’ s pocket handkerchief , and throwing it out of window— “ he is full of monkey tricks. ” and soon afterwards , on the second boy ’ s violently pinching one of the same lady ’ s fingers , she fondly observed , “ how playful william is ! ”
austen	sense	“ and here is my sweet little annamaria , ” she added , tenderly caressing a little girl of three years old , who had not made a noise for the last two minutes ; “ and she is always so gentle and quiet—never was there such a quiet little thing ! ”
austen	sense	but unfortunately in bestowing these embraces , a pin in her ladyship ’ s head dress slightly scratching the child ’ s neck , produced from this pattern of gentleness such violent screams , as could hardly be outdone by any creature professedly noisy . the mother ’ s consternation was excessive ; but it could not surpass the alarm of the miss steeles , and every thing was done by all three , in so critical an emergency , which affection could suggest as likely to assuage the agonies of the little sufferer . she was seated in her mother ’ s lap , covered with kisses , her wound bathed with lavender-water , by one of the miss steeles , who was on her knees to attend her , and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by the other . with such a reward for her tears , the child was too wise to cease crying . she still screamed and sobbed lustily , kicked her two brothers for offering to touch her , and all their united soothings were ineffectual till lady middleton luckily remembering that in a scene of similar distress last week , some apricot marmalade had been successfully applied for a bruised temple , the same remedy was eagerly proposed for this unfortunate scratch , and a slight intermission of screams in the young lady on hearing it , gave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected . she was carried out of the room therefore in her mother ’ s arms , in quest of this medicine , and as the two boys chose to follow , though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay behind , the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the room had not known for many hours .
austen	sense	“ poor little creatures ! ” said miss steele , as soon as they were gone . “ it might have been a very sad accident. ” “ yet i hardly know how , ” cried marianne , “ unless it had been under totally different circumstances . but this is the usual way of heightening alarm , where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality . ”
austen	sense	“ what a sweet woman lady middleton is ! ” said lucy steele . marianne was silent ; it was impossible for her to say what she did not feel , however trivial the occasion ; and upon elinor therefore the whole task of telling lies when politeness required it , always fell . she did her best when thus called on , by speaking of lady middleton with more warmth than she felt , though with far less than miss lucy .
austen	sense	“ and sir john too , ” cried the elder sister , “ what a charming man he is ! ” here too , miss dashwood ’ s commendation , being only simple and just , came in without any eclat . she merely observed that he was perfectly good humoured and friendly .
austen	sense	“ and what a charming little family they have ! i never saw such fine children in my life.—i declare i quite doat upon them already , and indeed i am always distractedly fond of children . ”
austen	sense	“ i should guess so , ” said elinor , with a smile , “ from what i have witnessed this morning. ” “ i have a notion , ” said lucy , “ you think the little middletons rather too much indulged ; perhaps they may be the outside of enough ; but it is so natural in lady middleton ; and for my part , i love to see children full of life and spirits ; i can not bear them if they are tame and quiet . ”
austen	sense	“ i confess , ” replied elinor , “ that while i am at barton park , i never think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence. ” a short pause succeeded this speech , which was first broken by miss steele , who seemed very much disposed for conversation , and who now said rather abruptly , “ and how do you like devonshire , miss dashwood ? i suppose you were very sorry to leave sussex . ”
austen	sense	in some surprise at the familiarity of this question , or at least of the manner in which it was spoken , elinor replied that she was . “ norland is a prodigious beautiful place , is not it ? ” added miss steele .
austen	sense	“ we have heard sir john admire it excessively , ” said lucy , who seemed to think some apology necessary for the freedom of her sister . “ i think every one _must_ admire it , ” replied elinor , “ who ever saw the place ; though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its beauties as we do . ”
austen	sense	“ and had you a great many smart beaux there ? i suppose you have not so many in this part of the world ; for my part , i think they are a vast addition always . ”
austen	sense	“ but why should you think , ” said lucy , looking ashamed of her sister , “ that there are not as many genteel young men in devonshire as sussex ? ” “ nay , my dear , i ’ m sure i don ’ t pretend to say that there an ’ t . i ’ m sure there ’ s a vast many smart beaux in exeter ; but you know , how could i tell what smart beaux there might be about norland ; and i was only afraid the miss dashwoods might find it dull at barton , if they had not so many as they used to have . but perhaps you young ladies may not care about the beaux , and had as lief be without them as with them . for my part , i think they are vastly agreeable , provided they dress smart and behave civil . but i can ’ t bear to see them dirty and nasty . now there ’ s mr. rose at exeter , a prodigious smart young man , quite a beau , clerk to mr. simpson , you know , and yet if you do but meet him of a morning , he is not fit to be seen . i suppose your brother was quite a beau , miss dashwood , before he married , as he was so rich ? ”
austen	sense	“ upon my word , ” replied elinor , “ i can not tell you , for i do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word . but this i can say , that if he ever was a beau before he married , he is one still for there is not the smallest alteration in him . ”
austen	sense	“ oh ! dear ! one never thinks of married men ’ s being beaux—they have something else to do. ” “ lord ! anne , ” cried her sister , “ you can talk of nothing but beaux ; —you will make miss dashwood believe you think of nothing else. ” and then to turn the discourse , she began admiring the house and the furniture .
austen	sense	this specimen of the miss steeles was enough . the vulgar freedom and folly of the eldest left her no recommendation , and as elinor was not blinded by the beauty , or the shrewd look of the youngest , to her want of real elegance and artlessness , she left the house without any wish of knowing them better .
austen	sense	not so the miss steeles . they came from exeter , well provided with admiration for the use of sir john middleton , his family , and all his relations , and no niggardly proportion was now dealt out to his fair cousins , whom they declared to be the most beautiful , elegant , accomplished , and agreeable girls they had ever beheld , and with whom they were particularly anxious to be better acquainted . and to be better acquainted therefore , elinor soon found was their inevitable lot , for as sir john was entirely on the side of the miss steeles , their party would be too strong for opposition , and that kind of intimacy must be submitted to , which consists of sitting an hour or two together in the same room almost every day . sir john could do no more ; but he did not know that any more was required : to be together was , in his opinion , to be intimate , and while his continual schemes for their meeting were effectual , he had not a doubt of their being established friends .
austen	sense	to do him justice , he did every thing in his power to promote their unreserve , by making the miss steeles acquainted with whatever he knew or supposed of his cousins ’ situations in the most delicate particulars ; and elinor had not seen them more than twice , before the eldest of them wished her joy on her sister ’ s having been so lucky as to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she came to barton .
austen	sense	“ ’ twill be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure , ” said she , “ and i hear he is quite a beau , and prodigious handsome . and i hope you may have as good luck yourself soon , —but perhaps you may have a friend in the corner already . ”
austen	sense	elinor could not suppose that sir john would be more nice in proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for edward , than he had been with respect to marianne ; indeed it was rather his favourite joke of the two , as being somewhat newer and more conjectural ; and since edward ’ s visit , they had never dined together without his drinking to her best affections with so much significancy and so many nods and winks , as to excite general attention . the letter f—had been likewise invariably brought forward , and found productive of such countless jokes , that its character as the wittiest letter in the alphabet had been long established with elinor .
austen	sense	the miss steeles , as she expected , had now all the benefit of these jokes , and in the eldest of them they raised a curiosity to know the name of the gentleman alluded to , which , though often impertinently expressed , was perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitiveness into the concerns of their family . but sir john did not sport long with the curiosity which he delighted to raise , for he had at least as much pleasure in telling the name , as miss steele had in hearing it .
austen	sense	“ his name is ferrars , ” said he , in a very audible whisper ; “ but pray do not tell it , for it ’ s a great secret. ” “ ferrars ! ” repeated miss steele ; “ mr . ferrars is the happy man , is he ? what ! your sister-in-law ’ s brother , miss dashwood ? a very agreeable young man to be sure ; i know him very well . ”
austen	sense	“ how can you say so , anne ? ” cried lucy , who generally made an amendment to all her sister ’ s assertions . “ though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle ’ s , it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well . ”
austen	sense	elinor heard all this with attention and surprise . “ and who was this uncle ? where did he live ? how came they acquainted ? ” she wished very much to have the subject continued , though she did not chuse to join in it herself ; but nothing more of it was said , and for the first time in her life , she thought mrs. jennings deficient either in curiosity after petty information , or in a disposition to communicate it . the manner in which miss steele had spoken of edward , increased her curiosity ; for it struck her as being rather ill-natured , and suggested the suspicion of that lady ’ s knowing , or fancying herself to know something to his disadvantage.—but her curiosity was unavailing , for no farther notice was taken of mr. ferrars ’ s name by miss steele when alluded to , or even openly mentioned by sir john .
austen	sense	chapter xxii . marianne , who had never much toleration for any thing like impertinence , vulgarity , inferiority of parts , or even difference of taste from herself , was at this time particularly ill-disposed , from the state of her spirits , to be pleased with the miss steeles , or to encourage their advances ; and to the invariable coldness of her behaviour towards them , which checked every endeavour at intimacy on their side , elinor principally attributed that preference of herself which soon became evident in the manners of both , but especially of lucy , who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation , or of striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy and frank communication of her sentiments .
austen	sense	lucy was naturally clever ; her remarks were often just and amusing ; and as a companion for half an hour elinor frequently found her agreeable ; but her powers had received no aid from education : she was ignorant and illiterate ; and her deficiency of all mental improvement , her want of information in the most common particulars , could not be concealed from miss dashwood , in spite of her constant endeavour to appear to advantage . elinor saw , and pitied her for , the neglect of abilities which education might have rendered so respectable ; but she saw , with less tenderness of feeling , the thorough want of delicacy , of rectitude , and integrity of mind , which her attentions , her assiduities , her flatteries at the park betrayed ; and she could have no lasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined insincerity with ignorance ; whose want of instruction prevented their meeting in conversation on terms of equality , and whose conduct toward others made every show of attention and deference towards herself perfectly valueless .
austen	sense	“ you will think my question an odd one , i dare say , ” said lucy to her one day , as they were walking together from the park to the cottage— “ but pray , are you personally acquainted with your sister-in-law ’ s mother , mrs. ferrars ? ”
austen	sense	elinor _did_ think the question a very odd one , and her countenance expressed it , as she answered that she had never seen mrs. ferrars . “ indeed ! ” replied lucy ; “ i wonder at that , for i thought you must have seen her at norland sometimes . then , perhaps , you can not tell me what sort of a woman she is ? ”
austen	sense	“ no , ” returned elinor , cautious of giving her real opinion of edward ’ s mother , and not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinent curiosity ; “ i know nothing of her. ” “ i am sure you think me very strange , for enquiring about her in such a way , ” said lucy , eyeing elinor attentively as she spoke ; “ but perhaps there may be reasons—i wish i might venture ; but however i hope you will do me the justice of believing that i do not mean to be impertinent . ”
austen	sense	elinor made her a civil reply , and they walked on for a few minutes in silence . it was broken by lucy , who renewed the subject again by saying , with some hesitation ,
austen	sense	“ i can not bear to have you think me impertinently curious . i am sure i would rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth having as yours . and i am sure i should not have the smallest fear of trusting _you ; _ indeed , i should be very glad of your advice how to manage in such an uncomfortable situation as i am ; but , however , there is no occasion to trouble _you_ . i am sorry you do not happen to know mrs. ferrars . ”
austen	sense	“ i am sorry i do _not_ , ” said elinor , in great astonishment , “ if it could be of any use to you to know my opinion of her . but really i never understood that you were at all connected with that family , and therefore i am a little surprised , i confess , at so serious an inquiry into her character . ”
austen	sense	“ i dare say you are , and i am sure i do not at all wonder at it . but if i dared tell you all , you would not be so much surprised . mrs. ferrars is certainly nothing to me at present—but the time _may_ come—how soon it will come must depend upon herself—when we may be very intimately connected . ”
austen	sense	she looked down as she said this , amiably bashful , with only one side glance at her companion to observe its effect on her . “ good heavens ! ” cried elinor , “ what do you mean ? are you acquainted with mr. robert ferrars ? can you be ? ” and she did not feel much delighted with the idea of such a sister-in-law .
austen	sense	“ no , ” replied lucy , “ not to mr. _robert_ ferrars—i never saw him in my life ; but , ” fixing her eyes upon elinor , “ to his eldest brother. ” what felt elinor at that moment ? astonishment , that would have been as painful as it was strong , had not an immediate disbelief of the assertion attended it . she turned towards lucy in silent amazement , unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration ; and though her complexion varied , she stood firm in incredulity , and felt in no danger of an hysterical fit , or a swoon .
austen	sense	“ you may well be surprised , ” continued lucy ; “ for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before ; for i dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it to you or any of your family ; because it was always meant to be a great secret , and i am sure has been faithfully kept so by me to this hour . not a soul of all my relations know of it but anne , and i never should have mentioned it to you , if i had not felt the greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy ; and i really thought my behaviour in asking so many questions about mrs. ferrars must seem so odd , that it ought to be explained . and i do not think mr. ferrars can be displeased , when he knows i have trusted you , because i know he has the highest opinion in the world of all your family , and looks upon yourself and the other miss dashwoods quite as his own sisters. ” —she paused .
austen	sense	elinor for a few moments remained silent . her astonishment at what she heard was at first too great for words ; but at length forcing herself to speak , and to speak cautiously , she said , with calmness of manner , which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude— “ may i ask if your engagement is of long standing ? ”
austen	sense	“ we have been engaged these four years. ” “ four years ! ” “ yes. ” elinor , though greatly shocked , still felt unable to believe it . “ i did not know , ” said she , “ that you were even acquainted till the other day . ”
austen	sense	“ our acquaintance , however , is of many years date . he was under my uncle ’ s care , you know , a considerable while. ” “ your uncle ! ” “ yes ; mr. pratt . did you never hear him talk of mr. pratt ? ”
austen	sense	“ i think i have , ” replied elinor , with an exertion of spirits , which increased with her increase of emotion . “ he was four years with my uncle , who lives at longstaple , near plymouth . it was there our acquaintance begun , for my sister and me was often staying with my uncle , and it was there our engagement was formed , though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil ; but he was almost always with us afterwards . i was very unwilling to enter into it , as you may imagine , without the knowledge and approbation of his mother ; but i was too young , and loved him too well , to be so prudent as i ought to have been . though you do not know him so well as me , miss dashwood , you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him . ”
austen	sense	“ certainly , ” answered elinor , without knowing what she said ; but after a moment ’ s reflection , she added , with revived security of edward ’ s honour and love , and her companion ’ s falsehood— “ engaged to mr. edward ferrars ! —i confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me , that really—i beg your pardon ; but surely there must be some mistake of person or name . we can not mean the same mr. ferrars . ”
austen	sense	“ we can mean no other , ” cried lucy , smiling . “ mr . edward ferrars , the eldest son of mrs. ferrars , of park street , and brother of your sister-in-law , mrs. john dashwood , is the person i mean ; you must allow that i am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness depends . ”
austen	sense	“ it is strange , ” replied elinor , in a most painful perplexity , “ that i should never have heard him even mention your name. ” “ no ; considering our situation , it was not strange . our first care has been to keep the matter secret . you knew nothing of me , or my family , and , therefore , there could be no _occasion_ for ever mentioning my name to you ; and , as he was always particularly afraid of his sister ’ s suspecting any thing , _that_ was reason enough for his not mentioning it . ”
austen	sense	she was silent.—elinor ’ s security sunk ; but her self-command did not sink with it . “ four years you have been engaged , ” said she with a firm voice . “ yes ; and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait . poor edward ! it puts him quite out of heart. ” then taking a small miniature from her pocket , she added , “ to prevent the possibility of mistake , be so good as to look at this face . it does not do him justice , to be sure , but yet i think you can not be deceived as to the person it was drew for.—i have had it above these three years . ”
austen	sense	she put it into her hands as she spoke ; and when elinor saw the painting , whatever other doubts her fear of a too hasty decision , or her wish of detecting falsehood might suffer to linger in her mind , she could have none of its being edward ’ s face . she returned it almost instantly , acknowledging the likeness .
austen	sense	“ i have never been able , ” continued lucy , “ to give him my picture in return , which i am very much vexed at , for he has been always so anxious to get it ! but i am determined to set for it the very first opportunity . ”
austen	sense	“ you are quite in the right , ” replied elinor calmly . they then proceeded a few paces in silence . lucy spoke first . “ i am sure , ” said she , “ i have no doubt in the world of your faithfully keeping this secret , because you must know of what importance it is to us , not to have it reach his mother ; for she would never approve of it , i dare say . i shall have no fortune , and i fancy she is an exceeding proud woman . ”
austen	sense	“ i certainly did not seek your confidence , ” said elinor ; “ but you do me no more than justice in imagining that i may be depended on . your secret is safe with me ; but pardon me if i express some surprise at so unnecessary a communication . you must at least have felt that my being acquainted with it could not add to its safety . ”
austen	sense	as she said this , she looked earnestly at lucy , hoping to discover something in her countenance ; perhaps the falsehood of the greatest part of what she had been saying ; but lucy ’ s countenance suffered no change .
austen	sense	“ i was afraid you would think i was taking a great liberty with you , ” said she , “ in telling you all this . i have not known you long to be sure , personally at least , but i have known you and all your family by description a great while ; and as soon as i saw you , i felt almost as if you was an old acquaintance . besides in the present case , i really thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular inquiries about edward ’ s mother ; and i am so unfortunate , that i have not a creature whose advice i can ask . anne is the only person that knows of it , and she has no judgment at all ; indeed , she does me a great deal more harm than good , for i am in constant fear of her betraying me . she does not know how to hold her tongue , as you must perceive , and i am sure i was in the greatest fright in the world t ’ other day , when edward ’ s name was mentioned by sir john , lest she should out with it all . you can ’ t think how much i go through in my mind from it altogether . i only wonder that i am alive after what i have suffered for edward ’ s sake these last four years . every thing in such suspense and uncertainty ; and seeing him so seldom—we can hardly meet above twice a-year . i am sure i wonder my heart is not quite broke . ”
austen	sense	here she took out her handkerchief ; but elinor did not feel very compassionate . “ sometimes. ” continued lucy , after wiping her eyes , “ i think whether it would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely. ” as she said this , she looked directly at her companion . “ but then at other times i have not resolution enough for it . i can not bear the thoughts of making him so miserable , as i know the very mention of such a thing would do . and on my own account too—so dear as he is to me—i don ’ t think i could be equal to it . what would you advise me to do in such a case , miss dashwood ? what would you do yourself ? ”
austen	sense	“ pardon me , ” replied elinor , startled by the question ; “ but i can give you no advice under such circumstances . your own judgment must direct you. ” “ to be sure , ” continued lucy , after a few minutes silence on both sides , “ his mother must provide for him sometime or other ; but poor edward is so cast down by it ! did you not think him dreadful low-spirited when he was at barton ? he was so miserable when he left us at longstaple , to go to you , that i was afraid you would think him quite ill . ”
austen	sense	“ did he come from your uncle ’ s , then , when he visited us ? ” “ oh , yes ; he had been staying a fortnight with us . did you think he came directly from town ? ” “ no , ” replied elinor , most feelingly sensible of every fresh circumstance in favour of lucy ’ s veracity ; “ i remember he told us , that he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near plymouth. ” she remembered too , her own surprise at the time , at his mentioning nothing farther of those friends , at his total silence with respect even to their names .
austen	sense	“ did not you think him sadly out of spirits ? ” repeated lucy . “ we did , indeed , particularly so when he first arrived. ” “ i begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was the matter ; but it made him so melancholy , not being able to stay more than a fortnight with us , and seeing me so much affected . poor fellow ! i am afraid it is just the same with him now ; for he writes in wretched spirits . i heard from him just before i left exeter ; ” taking a letter from her pocket and carelessly showing the direction to elinor . “ you know his hand , i dare say , —a charming one it is ; but that is not written so well as usual . he was tired , i dare say , for he had just filled the sheet to me as full as possible . ”
austen	sense	elinor saw that it _was_ his hand , and she could doubt no longer . this picture , she had allowed herself to believe , might have been accidentally obtained ; it might not have been edward ’ s gift ; but a correspondence between them by letter , could subsist only under a positive engagement , could be authorised by nothing else ; for a few moments , she was almost overcome—her heart sunk within her , and she could hardly stand ; but exertion was indispensably necessary ; and she struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings , that her success was speedy , and for the time complete .
austen	sense	“ writing to each other , ” said lucy , returning the letter into her pocket , “ is the only comfort we have in such long separations . yes , _i_ have one other comfort in his picture , but poor edward has not even _that_ . if he had but my picture , he says he should be easy . i gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at longstaple last , and that was some comfort to him , he said , but not equal to a picture . perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him ? ”
austen	sense	“ i did , ” said elinor , with a composure of voice , under which was concealed an emotion and distress beyond any thing she had ever felt before . she was mortified , shocked , confounded .
austen	sense	fortunately for her , they had now reached the cottage , and the conversation could be continued no farther . after sitting with them a few minutes , the miss steeles returned to the park , and elinor was then at liberty to think and be wretched .
austen	sense	end of the first volume chapter xxiii . however small elinor ’ s general dependence on lucy ’ s veracity might be , it was impossible for her on serious reflection to suspect it in the present case , where no temptation could be answerable to the folly of inventing a falsehood of such a description . what lucy had asserted to be true , therefore , elinor could not , dared not longer doubt ; supported as it was too on every side by such probabilities and proofs , and contradicted by nothing but her own wishes . their opportunity of acquaintance in the house of mr. pratt was a foundation for the rest , at once indisputable and alarming ; and edward ’ s visit near plymouth , his melancholy state of mind , his dissatisfaction at his own prospects , his uncertain behaviour towards herself , the intimate knowledge of the miss steeles as to norland and their family connections , which had often surprised her , the picture , the letter , the ring , formed altogether such a body of evidence , as overcame every fear of condemning him unfairly , and established as a fact , which no partiality could set aside , his ill-treatment of herself.—her resentment of such behaviour , her indignation at having been its dupe , for a short time made her feel only for herself ; but other ideas , other considerations , soon arose . had edward been intentionally deceiving her ? had he feigned a regard for her which he did not feel ? was his engagement to lucy an engagement of the heart ? no ; whatever it might once have been , she could not believe it such at present . his affection was all her own . she could not be deceived in that . her mother , sisters , fanny , all had been conscious of his regard for her at norland ; it was not an illusion of her own vanity . he certainly loved her . what a softener of the heart was this persuasion ! how much could it not tempt her to forgive ! he had been blamable , highly blamable , in remaining at norland after he first felt her influence over him to be more than it ought to be . in that , he could not be defended ; but if he had injured her , how much more had he injured himself ; if her case were pitiable , his was hopeless . his imprudence had made her miserable for a while ; but it seemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever being otherwise . she might in time regain tranquillity ; but _he_ , what had he to look forward to ? could he ever be tolerably happy with lucy steele ; could he , were his affection for herself out of the question , with his integrity , his delicacy , and well-informed mind , be satisfied with a wife like her—illiterate , artful , and selfish ?
austen	sense	the youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to every thing but her beauty and good nature ; but the four succeeding years—years , which if rationally spent , give such improvement to the understanding , must have opened his eyes to her defects of education , while the same period of time , spent on her side in inferior society and more frivolous pursuits , had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity which might once have given an interesting character to her beauty .
austen	sense	if in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself , his difficulties from his mother had seemed great , how much greater were they now likely to be , when the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior in connections , and probably inferior in fortune to herself . these difficulties , indeed , with a heart so alienated from lucy , might not press very hard upon his patience ; but melancholy was the state of the person by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness , could be felt as a relief !
austen	sense	as these considerations occurred to her in painful succession , she wept for him , more than for herself . supported by the conviction of having done nothing to merit her present unhappiness , and consoled by the belief that edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem , she thought she could even now , under the first smart of the heavy blow , command herself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her mother and sisters . and so well was she able to answer her own expectations , that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after she had first suffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes , no one would have supposed from the appearance of the sisters , that elinor was mourning in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever from the object of her love , and that marianne was internally dwelling on the perfections of a man , of whose whole heart she felt thoroughly possessed , and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drove near their house .
austen	sense	the necessity of concealing from her mother and marianne , what had been entrusted in confidence to herself , though it obliged her to unceasing exertion , was no aggravation of elinor ’ s distress . on the contrary it was a relief to her , to be spared the communication of what would give such affliction to them , and to be saved likewise from hearing that condemnation of edward , which would probably flow from the excess of their partial affection for herself , and which was more than she felt equal to support .
austen	sense	from their counsel , or their conversation , she knew she could receive no assistance , their tenderness and sorrow must add to her distress , while her self-command would neither receive encouragement from their example nor from their praise . she was stronger alone , and her own good sense so well supported her , that her firmness was as unshaken , her appearance of cheerfulness as invariable , as with regrets so poignant and so fresh , it was possible for them to be .
austen	sense	much as she had suffered from her first conversation with lucy on the subject , she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it ; and this for more reasons than one . she wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement repeated again , she wanted more clearly to understand what lucy really felt for edward , whether there were any sincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him , and she particularly wanted to convince lucy , by her readiness to enter on the matter again , and her calmness in conversing on it , that she was no otherwise interested in it than as a friend , which she very much feared her involuntary agitation , in their morning discourse , must have left at least doubtful . that lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very probable : it was plain that edward had always spoken highly in her praise , not merely from lucy ’ s assertion , but from her venturing to trust her on so short a personal acquaintance , with a secret so confessedly and evidently important . and even sir john ’ s joking intelligence must have had some weight . but indeed , while elinor remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by edward , it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it natural that lucy should be jealous ; and that she was so , her very confidence was a proof . what other reason for the disclosure of the affair could there be , but that elinor might be informed by it of lucy ’ s superior claims on edward , and be taught to avoid him in future ? she had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her rival ’ s intentions , and while she was firmly resolved to act by her as every principle of honour and honesty directed , to combat her own affection for edward and to see him as little as possible ; she could not deny herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince lucy that her heart was unwounded . and as she could now have nothing more painful to hear on the subject than had already been told , she did not mistrust her own ability of going through a repetition of particulars with composure .
austen	sense	but it was not immediately that an opportunity of doing so could be commanded , though lucy was as well disposed as herself to take advantage of any that occurred ; for the weather was not often fine enough to allow of their joining in a walk , where they might most easily separate themselves from the others ; and though they met at least every other evening either at the park or cottage , and chiefly at the former , they could not be supposed to meet for the sake of conversation . such a thought would never enter either sir john or lady middleton ’ s head ; and therefore very little leisure was ever given for a general chat , and none at all for particular discourse . they met for the sake of eating , drinking , and laughing together , playing at cards , or consequences , or any other game that was sufficiently noisy .
austen	sense	one or two meetings of this kind had taken place , without affording elinor any chance of engaging lucy in private , when sir john called at the cottage one morning , to beg , in the name of charity , that they would all dine with lady middleton that day , as he was obliged to attend the club at exeter , and she would otherwise be quite alone , except her mother and the two miss steeles . elinor , who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she had in view , in such a party as this was likely to be , more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil and well-bred direction of lady middleton than when her husband united them together in one noisy purpose , immediately accepted the invitation ; margaret , with her mother ’ s permission , was equally compliant , and marianne , though always unwilling to join any of their parties , was persuaded by her mother , who could not bear to have her seclude herself from any chance of amusement , to go likewise .
austen	sense	the young ladies went , and lady middleton was happily preserved from the frightful solitude which had threatened her . the insipidity of the meeting was exactly such as elinor had expected ; it produced not one novelty of thought or expression , and nothing could be less interesting than the whole of their discourse both in the dining parlour and drawing room : to the latter , the children accompanied them , and while they remained there , she was too well convinced of the impossibility of engaging lucy ’ s attention to attempt it . they quitted it only with the removal of the tea-things . the card-table was then placed , and elinor began to wonder at herself for having ever entertained a hope of finding time for conversation at the park . they all rose up in preparation for a round game .
austen	sense	“ i am glad , ” said lady middleton to lucy , “ you are not going to finish poor little annamaria ’ s basket this evening ; for i am sure it must hurt your eyes to work filigree by candlelight . and we will make the dear little love some amends for her disappointment to-morrow , and then i hope she will not much mind it . ”
austen	sense	this hint was enough , lucy recollected herself instantly and replied , “ indeed you are very much mistaken , lady middleton ; i am only waiting to know whether you can make your party without me , or i should have been at my filigree already . i would not disappoint the little angel for all the world : and if you want me at the card-table now , i am resolved to finish the basket after supper . ”
austen	sense	“ you are very good , i hope it won ’ t hurt your eyes—will you ring the bell for some working candles ? my poor little girl would be sadly disappointed , i know , if the basket was not finished tomorrow , for though i told her it certainly would not , i am sure she depends upon having it done . ”
austen	sense	lucy directly drew her work table near her and reseated herself with an alacrity and cheerfulness which seemed to infer that she could taste no greater delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child .
austen	sense	lady middleton proposed a rubber of casino to the others . no one made any objection but marianne , who with her usual inattention to the forms of general civility , exclaimed , “ your ladyship will have the goodness to excuse _me_—you know i detest cards . i shall go to the piano-forte ; i have not touched it since it was tuned. ” and without farther ceremony , she turned away and walked to the instrument .
austen	sense	lady middleton looked as if she thanked heaven that _she_ had never made so rude a speech . “ marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know , ma ’ am , ” said elinor , endeavouring to smooth away the offence ; “ and i do not much wonder at it ; for it is the very best toned piano-forte i ever heard . ”
austen	sense	the remaining five were now to draw their cards . “ perhaps , ” continued elinor , “ if i should happen to cut out , i may be of some use to miss lucy steele , in rolling her papers for her ; and there is so much still to be done to the basket , that it must be impossible i think for her labour singly , to finish it this evening . i should like the work exceedingly , if she would allow me a share in it . ”
austen	sense	“ indeed i shall be very much obliged to you for your help , ” cried lucy , “ for i find there is more to be done to it than i thought there was ; and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear annamaria after all . ”
austen	sense	“ oh ! that would be terrible , indeed , ” said miss steele . “ dear little soul , how i do love her ! ” “ you are very kind , ” said lady middleton to elinor ; “ and as you really like the work , perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber , or will you take your chance now ? ”
austen	sense	elinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals , and thus by a little of that address which marianne could never condescend to practise , gained her own end , and pleased lady middleton at the same time . lucy made room for her with ready attention , and the two fair rivals were thus seated side by side at the same table , and , with the utmost harmony , engaged in forwarding the same work . the pianoforte at which marianne , wrapped up in her own music and her own thoughts , had by this time forgotten that any body was in the room besides herself , was luckily so near them that miss dashwood now judged she might safely , under the shelter of its noise , introduce the interesting subject , without any risk of being heard at the card-table .
austen	sense	chapter xxiv . in a firm , though cautious tone , elinor thus began . “ i should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with , if i felt no desire for its continuance , or no farther curiosity on its subject . i will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again . ”
austen	sense	“ thank you , ” cried lucy warmly , “ for breaking the ice ; you have set my heart at ease by it ; for i was somehow or other afraid i had offended you by what i told you that monday . ”
austen	sense	“ offended me ! how could you suppose so ? believe me , ” and elinor spoke it with the truest sincerity , “ nothing could be farther from my intention than to give you such an idea . could you have a motive for the trust , that was not honourable and flattering to me ? ”
austen	sense	“ and yet i do assure you , ” replied lucy , her little sharp eyes full of meaning , “ there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in your manner that made me quite uncomfortable . i felt sure that you was angry with me ; and have been quarrelling with myself ever since , for having took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs . but i am very glad to find it was only my own fancy , and that you really do not blame me . if you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my heart speaking to you of what i am always thinking of every moment of my life , your compassion would make you overlook every thing else i am sure . ”
austen	sense	“ indeed , i can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you , to acknowledge your situation to me , and be assured that you shall never have reason to repent it . your case is a very unfortunate one ; you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties , and you will have need of all your mutual affection to support you under them . mr. ferrars , i believe , is entirely dependent on his mother . ”
austen	sense	“ he has only two thousand pounds of his own ; it would be madness to marry upon that , though for my own part , i could give up every prospect of more without a sigh . i have been always used to a very small income , and could struggle with any poverty for him ; but i love him too well to be the selfish means of robbing him , perhaps , of all that his mother might give him if he married to please her . we must wait , it may be for many years . with almost every other man in the world , it would be an alarming prospect ; but edward ’ s affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of i know . ”
austen	sense	“ that conviction must be every thing to you ; and he is undoubtedly supported by the same trust in your ’ s . if the strength of your reciprocal attachment had failed , as between many people , and under many circumstances it naturally would during a four years ’ engagement , your situation would have been pitiable , indeed . ”
austen	sense	lucy here looked up ; but elinor was careful in guarding her countenance from every expression that could give her words a suspicious tendency . “ edward ’ s love for me , ” said lucy , “ has been pretty well put to the test , by our long , very long absence since we were first engaged , and it has stood the trial so well , that i should be unpardonable to doubt it now . i can safely say that he has never gave me one moment ’ s alarm on that account from the first . ”
austen	sense	elinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh at this assertion . lucy went on . “ i am rather of a jealous temper too by nature , and from our different situations in life , from his being so much more in the world than me , and our continual separation , i was enough inclined for suspicion , to have found out the truth in an instant , if there had been the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met , or any lowness of spirits that i could not account for , or if he had talked more of one lady than another , or seemed in any respect less happy at longstaple than he used to be . i do not mean to say that i am particularly observant or quick-sighted in general , but in such a case i am sure i could not be deceived . ”
austen	sense	“ all this , ” thought elinor , “ is very pretty ; but it can impose upon neither of us. ” “ but what , ” said she after a short silence , “ are your views ? or have you none but that of waiting for mrs. ferrars ’ s death , which is a melancholy and shocking extremity ? —is her son determined to submit to this , and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which it may involve you , rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a while by owning the truth ? ”
austen	sense	“ if we could be certain that it would be only for a while ! but mrs. ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman , and in her first fit of anger upon hearing it , would very likely secure every thing to robert , and the idea of that , for edward ’ s sake , frightens away all my inclination for hasty measures . ”
austen	sense	“ and for your own sake too , or you are carrying your disinterestedness beyond reason. ” lucy looked at elinor again , and was silent . “ do you know mr. robert ferrars ? ” asked elinor .
austen	sense	“ not at all—i never saw him ; but i fancy he is very unlike his brother—silly and a great coxcomb. ” “ a great coxcomb ! ” repeated miss steele , whose ear had caught those words by a sudden pause in marianne ’ s music . “ oh , they are talking of their favourite beaux , i dare say . ”
austen	sense	“ no sister , ” cried lucy , “ you are mistaken there , our favourite beaux are _not_ great coxcombs. ” “ i can answer for it that miss dashwood ’ s is not , ” said mrs. jennings , laughing heartily ; “ for he is one of the modestest , prettiest behaved young men i ever saw ; but as for lucy , she is such a sly little creature , there is no finding out who _she_ likes . ”
austen	sense	“ oh , ” cried miss steele , looking significantly round at them , “ i dare say lucy ’ s beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as miss dashwood ’ s. ” elinor blushed in spite of herself . lucy bit her lip , and looked angrily at her sister . a mutual silence took place for some time . lucy first put an end to it by saying in a lower tone , though marianne was then giving them the powerful protection of a very magnificent concerto , —
austen	sense	“ i will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my head , for bringing matters to bear ; indeed i am bound to let you into the secret , for you are a party concerned . i dare say you have seen enough of edward to know that he would prefer the church to every other profession ; now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as he can , and then through your interest , which i am sure you would be kind enough to use out of friendship for him , and i hope out of some regard to me , your brother might be persuaded to give him norland living ; which i understand is a very good one , and the present incumbent not likely to live a great while . that would be enough for us to marry upon , and we might trust to time and chance for the rest . ”
austen	sense	“ i should always be happy , ” replied elinor , “ to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for mr. ferrars ; but do you not perceive that my interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary ? he is brother to mrs. john dashwood—_that_ must be recommendation enough to her husband . ”
austen	sense	“ but mrs. john dashwood would not much approve of edward ’ s going into orders. ” “ then i rather suspect that my interest would do very little. ” they were again silent for many minutes . at length lucy exclaimed with a deep sigh ,
austen	sense	“ i believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at once by dissolving the engagement . we seem so beset with difficulties on every side , that though it would make us miserable for a time , we should be happier perhaps in the end . but you will not give me your advice , miss dashwood ? ”
austen	sense	“ no , ” answered elinor , with a smile , which concealed very agitated feelings , “ on such a subject i certainly will not . you know very well that my opinion would have no weight with you , unless it were on the side of your wishes . ”
austen	sense	“ indeed you wrong me , ” replied lucy , with great solemnity ; “ i know nobody of whose judgment i think so highly as i do of yours ; and i do really believe , that if you was to say to me , ‘ i advise you by all means to put an end to your engagement with edward ferrars , it will be more for the happiness of both of you , ’ i should resolve upon doing it immediately . ”
austen	sense	elinor blushed for the insincerity of edward ’ s future wife , and replied , “ this compliment would effectually frighten me from giving any opinion on the subject had i formed one . it raises my influence much too high ; the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too much for an indifferent person . ”
austen	sense	“ ’ tis because you are an indifferent person , ” said lucy , with some pique , and laying a particular stress on those words , “ that your judgment might justly have such weight with me . if you could be supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings , your opinion would not be worth having . ”
austen	sense	elinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this , lest they might provoke each other to an unsuitable increase of ease and unreserve ; and was even partly determined never to mention the subject again . another pause therefore of many minutes ’ duration , succeeded this speech , and lucy was still the first to end it .
austen	sense	“ shall you be in town this winter , miss dashwood ? ” said she with all her accustomary complacency . “ certainly not. ” “ i am sorry for that , ” returned the other , while her eyes brightened at the information , “ it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you there ! but i dare say you will go for all that . to be sure , your brother and sister will ask you to come to them . ”
austen	sense	“ it will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do. ” “ how unlucky that is ! i had quite depended upon meeting you there . anne and me are to go the latter end of january to some relations who have been wanting us to visit them these several years ! but i only go for the sake of seeing edward . he will be there in february , otherwise london would have no charms for me ; i have not spirits for it . ”
austen	sense	elinor was soon called to the card-table by the conclusion of the first rubber , and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was therefore at an end , to which both of them submitted without any reluctance , for nothing had been said on either side to make them dislike each other less than they had done before ; and elinor sat down to the card table with the melancholy persuasion that edward was not only without affection for the person who was to be his wife ; but that he had not even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage , which sincere affection on _her_ side would have given , for self-interest alone could induce a woman to keep a man to an engagement , of which she seemed so thoroughly aware that he was weary .
austen	sense	from this time the subject was never revived by elinor , and when entered on by lucy , who seldom missed an opportunity of introducing it , and was particularly careful to inform her confidante , of her happiness whenever she received a letter from edward , it was treated by the former with calmness and caution , and dismissed as soon as civility would allow ; for she felt such conversations to be an indulgence which lucy did not deserve , and which were dangerous to herself .
austen	sense	the visit of the miss steeles at barton park was lengthened far beyond what the first invitation implied . their favour increased ; they could not be spared ; sir john would not hear of their going ; and in spite of their numerous and long arranged engagements in exeter , in spite of the absolute necessity of returning to fulfill them immediately , which was in full force at the end of every week , they were prevailed on to stay nearly two months at the park , and to assist in the due celebration of that festival which requires a more than ordinary share of private balls and large dinners to proclaim its importance .
austen	sense	chapter xxv . though mrs. jennings was in the habit of spending a large portion of the year at the houses of her children and friends , she was not without a settled habitation of her own . since the death of her husband , who had traded with success in a less elegant part of the town , she had resided every winter in a house in one of the streets near portman square . towards this home , she began on the approach of january to turn her thoughts , and thither she one day abruptly , and very unexpectedly by them , asked the elder misses dashwood to accompany her . elinor , without observing the varying complexion of her sister , and the animated look which spoke no indifference to the plan , immediately gave a grateful but absolute denial for both , in which she believed herself to be speaking their united inclinations . the reason alleged was their determined resolution of not leaving their mother at that time of the year . mrs. jennings received the refusal with some surprise , and repeated her invitation immediately .
austen	sense	“ oh , lord ! i am sure your mother can spare you very well , and i _do_ beg you will favour me with your company , for i ’ ve quite set my heart upon it . don ’ t fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me , for i shan ’ t put myself at all out of my way for you . it will only be sending betty by the coach , and i hope i can afford _that_ . we three shall be able to go very well in my chaise ; and when we are in town , if you do not like to go wherever i do , well and good , you may always go with one of my daughters . i am sure your mother will not object to it ; for i have had such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she will think me a very fit person to have the charge of you ; and if i don ’ t get one of you at least well married before i have done with you , it shall not be my fault . i shall speak a good word for you to all the young men , you may depend upon it . ”
austen	sense	“ i have a notion , ” said sir john , “ that miss marianne would not object to such a scheme , if her elder sister would come into it . it is very hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure , because miss dashwood does not wish it . so i would advise you two , to set off for town , when you are tired of barton , without saying a word to miss dashwood about it . ”
austen	sense	“ nay , ” cried mrs. jennings , “ i am sure i shall be monstrous glad of miss marianne ’ s company , whether miss dashwood will go or not , only the more the merrier say i , and i thought it would be more comfortable for them to be together ; because , if they got tired of me , they might talk to one another , and laugh at my odd ways behind my back . but one or the other , if not both of them , i must have . lord bless me ! how do you think i can live poking by myself , i who have been always used till this winter to have charlotte with me . come , miss marianne , let us strike hands upon the bargain , and if miss dashwood will change her mind by and bye , why so much the better . ”
austen	sense	“ i thank you , ma ’ am , sincerely thank you , ” said marianne , with warmth : “ your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever , and it would give me such happiness , yes , almost the greatest happiness i am capable of , to be able to accept it . but my mother , my dearest , kindest mother , —i feel the justice of what elinor has urged , and if she were to be made less happy , less comfortable by our absence—oh ! no , nothing should tempt me to leave her . it should not , must not be a struggle . ”
austen	sense	mrs. jennings repeated her assurance that mrs. dashwood could spare them perfectly well ; and elinor , who now understood her sister , and saw to what indifference to almost every thing else she was carried by her eagerness to be with willoughby again , made no farther direct opposition to the plan , and merely referred it to her mother ’ s decision , from whom however she scarcely expected to receive any support in her endeavour to prevent a visit , which she could not approve of for marianne , and which on her own account she had particular reasons to avoid . whatever marianne was desirous of , her mother would be eager to promote—she could not expect to influence the latter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she had never been able to inspire her with distrust ; and she dared not explain the motive of her own disinclination for going to london . that marianne , fastidious as she was , thoroughly acquainted with mrs. jennings ’ manners , and invariably disgusted by them , should overlook every inconvenience of that kind , should disregard whatever must be most wounding to her irritable feelings , in her pursuit of one object , was such a proof , so strong , so full , of the importance of that object to her , as elinor , in spite of all that had passed , was not prepared to witness .
austen	sense	on being informed of the invitation , mrs. dashwood , persuaded that such an excursion would be productive of much amusement to both her daughters , and perceiving through all her affectionate attention to herself , how much the heart of marianne was in it , would not hear of their declining the offer upon _her_ account ; insisted on their both accepting it directly ; and then began to foresee , with her usual cheerfulness , a variety of advantages that would accrue to them all , from this separation .
austen	sense	“ i am delighted with the plan , ” she cried , “ it is exactly what i could wish . margaret and i shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves . when you and the middletons are gone , we shall go on so quietly and happily together with our books and our music ! you will find margaret so improved when you come back again ! i have a little plan of alteration for your bedrooms too , which may now be performed without any inconvenience to any one . it is very right that you _should_ go to town ; i would have every young woman of your condition in life acquainted with the manners and amusements of london . you will be under the care of a motherly good sort of woman , of whose kindness to you i can have no doubt . and in all probability you will see your brother , and whatever may be his faults , or the faults of his wife , when i consider whose son he is , i can not bear to have you so wholly estranged from each other . ”
austen	sense	“ though with your usual anxiety for our happiness , ” said elinor , “ you have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which occurred to you , there is still one objection which , in my opinion , can not be so easily removed . ”
austen	sense	marianne ’ s countenance sunk . “ and what , ” said mrs. dashwood , “ is my dear prudent elinor going to suggest ? what formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward ? do not let me hear a word about the expense of it . ”
austen	sense	“ my objection is this ; though i think very well of mrs. jennings ’ s heart , she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure , or whose protection will give us consequence . ”
austen	sense	“ that is very true , ” replied her mother , “ but of her society , separately from that of other people , you will scarcely have any thing at all , and you will almost always appear in public with lady middleton . ”
austen	sense	“ if elinor is frightened away by her dislike of mrs. jennings , ” said marianne , “ at least it need not prevent my accepting her invitation . i have no such scruples , and i am sure i could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort . ”
austen	sense	elinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towards the manners of a person , to whom she had often had difficulty in persuading marianne to behave with tolerable politeness ; and resolved within herself , that if her sister persisted in going , she would go likewise , as she did not think it proper that marianne should be left to the sole guidance of her own judgment , or that mrs. jennings should be abandoned to the mercy of marianne for all the comfort of her domestic hours . to this determination she was the more easily reconciled , by recollecting that edward ferrars , by lucy ’ s account , was not to be in town before february ; and that their visit , without any unreasonable abridgement , might be previously finished .
austen	sense	“ i will have you _both_ go , ” said mrs. dashwood ; “ these objections are nonsensical . you will have much pleasure in being in london , and especially in being together ; and if elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment , she would foresee it there from a variety of sources ; she would , perhaps , expect some from improving her acquaintance with her sister-in-law ’ s family . ”
austen	sense	elinor had often wished for an opportunity of attempting to weaken her mother ’ s dependence on the attachment of edward and herself , that the shock might be less when the whole truth were revealed , and now on this attack , though almost hopeless of success , she forced herself to begin her design by saying , as calmly as she could , “ i like edward ferrars very much , and shall always be glad to see him ; but as to the rest of the family , it is a matter of perfect indifference to me , whether i am ever known to them or not . ”
austen	sense	mrs. dashwood smiled , and said nothing . marianne lifted up her eyes in astonishment , and elinor conjectured that she might as well have held her tongue . after very little farther discourse , it was finally settled that the invitation should be fully accepted . mrs. jennings received the information with a great deal of joy , and many assurances of kindness and care ; nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her . sir john was delighted ; for to a man , whose prevailing anxiety was the dread of being alone , the acquisition of two , to the number of inhabitants in london , was something . even lady middleton took the trouble of being delighted , which was putting herself rather out of her way ; and as for the miss steeles , especially lucy , they had never been so happy in their lives as this intelligence made them .
austen	sense	elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her wishes with less reluctance than she had expected to feel . with regard to herself , it was now a matter of unconcern whether she went to town or not , and when she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan , and her sister exhilarated by it in look , voice , and manner , restored to all her usual animation , and elevated to more than her usual gaiety , she could not be dissatisfied with the cause , and would hardly allow herself to distrust the consequence .
austen	sense	marianne ’ s joy was almost a degree beyond happiness , so great was the perturbation of her spirits and her impatience to be gone . her unwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmness ; and at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive . her mother ’ s affliction was hardly less , and elinor was the only one of the three , who seemed to consider the separation as any thing short of eternal .
austen	sense	their departure took place in the first week in january . the middletons were to follow in about a week . the miss steeles kept their station at the park , and were to quit it only with the rest of the family .
austen	sense	chapter xxvi . elinor could not find herself in the carriage with mrs. jennings , and beginning a journey to london under her protection , and as her guest , without wondering at her own situation , so short had their acquaintance with that lady been , so wholly unsuited were they in age and disposition , and so many had been her objections against such a measure only a few days before ! but these objections had all , with that happy ardour of youth which marianne and her mother equally shared , been overcome or overlooked ; and elinor , in spite of every occasional doubt of willoughby ’ s constancy , could not witness the rapture of delightful expectation which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes of marianne , without feeling how blank was her own prospect , how cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison , and how gladly she would engage in the solicitude of marianne ’ s situation to have the same animating object in view , the same possibility of hope . a short , a very short time however must now decide what willoughby ’ s intentions were ; in all probability he was already in town . marianne ’ s eagerness to be gone declared her dependence on finding him there ; and elinor was resolved not only upon gaining every new light as to his character which her own observation or the intelligence of others could give her , but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister with such zealous attention , as to ascertain what he was and what he meant , before many meetings had taken place . should the result of her observations be unfavourable , she was determined at all events to open the eyes of her sister ; should it be otherwise , her exertions would be of a different nature—she must then learn to avoid every selfish comparison , and banish every regret which might lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of marianne .
austen	sense	they were three days on their journey , and marianne ’ s behaviour as they travelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance and companionableness to mrs. jennings might be expected to be . she sat in silence almost all the way , wrapt in her own meditations , and scarcely ever voluntarily speaking , except when any object of picturesque beauty within their view drew from her an exclamation of delight exclusively addressed to her sister . to atone for this conduct therefore , elinor took immediate possession of the post of civility which she had assigned herself , behaved with the greatest attention to mrs. jennings , talked with her , laughed with her , and listened to her whenever she could ; and mrs. jennings on her side treated them both with all possible kindness , was solicitous on every occasion for their ease and enjoyment , and only disturbed that she could not make them choose their own dinners at the inn , nor extort a confession of their preferring salmon to cod , or boiled fowls to veal cutlets . they reached town by three o ’ clock the third day , glad to be released , after such a journey , from the confinement of a carriage , and ready to enjoy all the luxury of a good fire .
austen	sense	the house was handsome , and handsomely fitted up , and the young ladies were immediately put in possession of a very comfortable apartment . it had formerly been charlotte ’ s , and over the mantelpiece still hung a landscape in coloured silks of her performance , in proof of her having spent seven years at a great school in town to some effect .
austen	sense	as dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from their arrival , elinor determined to employ the interval in writing to her mother , and sat down for that purpose . in a few moments marianne did the same . “ _i_ am writing home , marianne , ” said elinor ; “ had not you better defer your letter for a day or two ? ”
austen	sense	“ i am _not_ going to write to my mother , ” replied marianne , hastily , and as if wishing to avoid any farther inquiry . elinor said no more ; it immediately struck her that she must then be writing to willoughby ; and the conclusion which as instantly followed was , that , however mysteriously they might wish to conduct the affair , they must be engaged . this conviction , though not entirely satisfactory , gave her pleasure , and she continued her letter with greater alacrity . marianne ’ s was finished in a very few minutes ; in length it could be no more than a note ; it was then folded up , sealed , and directed with eager rapidity . elinor thought she could distinguish a large w in the direction ; and no sooner was it complete than marianne , ringing the bell , requested the footman who answered it to get that letter conveyed for her to the two-penny post . this decided the matter at once .
austen	sense	her spirits still continued very high ; but there was a flutter in them which prevented their giving much pleasure to her sister , and this agitation increased as the evening drew on . she could scarcely eat any dinner , and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room , seemed anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage .
austen	sense	it was a great satisfaction to elinor that mrs. jennings , by being much engaged in her own room , could see little of what was passing . the tea things were brought in , and already had marianne been disappointed more than once by a rap at a neighbouring door , when a loud one was suddenly heard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house , elinor felt secure of its announcing willoughby ’ s approach , and marianne , starting up , moved towards the door . every thing was silent ; this could not be borne many seconds ; she opened the door , advanced a few steps towards the stairs , and after listening half a minute , returned into the room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard him would naturally produce ; in the ecstasy of her feelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming , “ oh , elinor , it is willoughby , indeed it is ! ” and seemed almost ready to throw herself into his arms , when colonel brandon appeared .
austen	sense	it was too great a shock to be borne with calmness , and she immediately left the room . elinor was disappointed too ; but at the same time her regard for colonel brandon ensured his welcome with her ; and she felt particularly hurt that a man so partial to her sister should perceive that she experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing him . she instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him , that he even observed marianne as she quitted the room , with such astonishment and concern , as hardly left him the recollection of what civility demanded towards herself .
austen	sense	“ is your sister ill ? ” said he . elinor answered in some distress that she was , and then talked of head-aches , low spirits , and over fatigues ; and of every thing to which she could decently attribute her sister ’ s behaviour .
austen	sense	he heard her with the most earnest attention , but seeming to recollect himself , said no more on the subject , and began directly to speak of his pleasure at seeing them in london , making the usual inquiries about their journey , and the friends they had left behind .
austen	sense	in this calm kind of way , with very little interest on either side , they continued to talk , both of them out of spirits , and the thoughts of both engaged elsewhere . elinor wished very much to ask whether willoughby were then in town , but she was afraid of giving him pain by any enquiry after his rival ; and at length , by way of saying something , she asked if he had been in london ever since she had seen him last . “ yes , ” he replied , with some embarrassment , “ almost ever since ; i have been once or twice at delaford for a few days , but it has never been in my power to return to barton . ”
austen	sense	this , and the manner in which it was said , immediately brought back to her remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place , with the uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to mrs. jennings , and she was fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on the subject than she had ever felt .
austen	sense	mrs. jennings soon came in . “ oh ! colonel , ” said she , with her usual noisy cheerfulness , “ i am monstrous glad to see you—sorry i could not come before—beg your pardon , but i have been forced to look about me a little , and settle my matters ; for it is a long while since i have been at home , and you know one has always a world of little odd things to do after one has been away for any time ; and then i have had cartwright to settle with . lord , i have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner ! but pray , colonel , how came you to conjure out that i should be in town today ? ”
austen	sense	“ i had the pleasure of hearing it at mr. palmer ’ s , where i have been dining. ” “ oh , you did ; well , and how do they all do at their house ? how does charlotte do ? i warrant you she is a fine size by this time . ”
austen	sense	“ mrs . palmer appeared quite well , and i am commissioned to tell you , that you will certainly see her to-morrow. ” “ ay , to be sure , i thought as much . well , colonel , i have brought two young ladies with me , you see—that is , you see but one of them now , but there is another somewhere . your friend , miss marianne , too—which you will not be sorry to hear . i do not know what you and mr. willoughby will do between you about her . ay , it is a fine thing to be young and handsome . well ! i was young once , but i never was very handsome—worse luck for me . however , i got a very good husband , and i don ’ t know what the greatest beauty can do more . ah ! poor man ! he has been dead these eight years and better . but colonel , where have you been to since we parted ? and how does your business go on ? come , come , let ’ s have no secrets among friends . ”
austen	sense	he replied with his accustomary mildness to all her inquiries , but without satisfying her in any . elinor now began to make the tea , and marianne was obliged to appear again .
austen	sense	after her entrance , colonel brandon became more thoughtful and silent than he had been before , and mrs. jennings could not prevail on him to stay long . no other visitor appeared that evening , and the ladies were unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed .
austen	sense	marianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits and happy looks . the disappointment of the evening before seemed forgotten in the expectation of what was to happen that day . they had not long finished their breakfast before mrs. palmer ’ s barouche stopped at the door , and in a few minutes she came laughing into the room : so delighted to see them all , that it was hard to say whether she received most pleasure from meeting her mother or the miss dashwoods again . so surprised at their coming to town , though it was what she had rather expected all along ; so angry at their accepting her mother ’ s invitation after having declined her own , though at the same time she would never have forgiven them if they had not come !
austen	sense	“ mr . palmer will be so happy to see you , ” said she ; “ what do you think he said when he heard of your coming with mama ? i forget what it was now , but it was something so droll ! ”
austen	sense	after an hour or two spent in what her mother called comfortable chat , or in other words , in every variety of inquiry concerning all their acquaintance on mrs. jennings ’ s side , and in laughter without cause on mrs. palmer ’ s , it was proposed by the latter that they should all accompany her to some shops where she had business that morning , to which mrs. jennings and elinor readily consented , as having likewise some purchases to make themselves ; and marianne , though declining it at first was induced to go likewise .
austen	sense	wherever they went , she was evidently always on the watch . in bond street especially , where much of their business lay , her eyes were in constant inquiry ; and in whatever shop the party were engaged , her mind was equally abstracted from every thing actually before them , from all that interested and occupied the others . restless and dissatisfied every where , her sister could never obtain her opinion of any article of purchase , however it might equally concern them both : she received no pleasure from anything ; was only impatient to be at home again , and could with difficulty govern her vexation at the tediousness of mrs. palmer , whose eye was caught by every thing pretty , expensive , or new ; who was wild to buy all , could determine on none , and dawdled away her time in rapture and indecision .
austen	sense	it was late in the morning before they returned home ; and no sooner had they entered the house than marianne flew eagerly up stairs , and when elinor followed , she found her turning from the table with a sorrowful countenance , which declared that no willoughby had been there .
austen	sense	“ has no letter been left here for me since we went out ? ” said she to the footman who then entered with the parcels . she was answered in the negative . “ are you quite sure of it ? ” she replied . “ are you certain that no servant , no porter has left any letter or note ? ”
austen	sense	the man replied that none had . “ how very odd ! ” said she , in a low and disappointed voice , as she turned away to the window . “ how odd , indeed ! ” repeated elinor within herself , regarding her sister with uneasiness . “ if she had not known him to be in town she would not have written to him , as she did ; she would have written to combe magna ; and if he is in town , how odd that he should neither come nor write ! oh ! my dear mother , you must be wrong in permitting an engagement between a daughter so young , a man so little known , to be carried on in so doubtful , so mysterious a manner ! _i_ long to inquire ; and how will _my_ interference be borne . ”
austen	sense	she determined , after some consideration , that if appearances continued many days longer as unpleasant as they now were , she would represent in the strongest manner to her mother the necessity of some serious enquiry into the affair .
austen	sense	mrs. palmer and two elderly ladies of mrs. jennings ’ s intimate acquaintance , whom she had met and invited in the morning , dined with them . the former left them soon after tea to fulfill her evening engagements ; and elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table for the others . marianne was of no use on these occasions , as she would never learn the game ; but though her time was therefore at her own disposal , the evening was by no means more productive of pleasure to her than to elinor , for it was spent in all the anxiety of expectation and the pain of disappointment . she sometimes endeavoured for a few minutes to read ; but the book was soon thrown aside , and she returned to the more interesting employment of walking backwards and forwards across the room , pausing for a moment whenever she came to the window , in hopes of distinguishing the long-expected rap .
austen	sense	chapter xxvii . “ if this open weather holds much longer , ” said mrs. jennings , when they met at breakfast the following morning , “ sir john will not like leaving barton next week ; ’ tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day ’ s pleasure . poor souls ! i always pity them when they do ; they seem to take it so much to heart . ”
austen	sense	“ that is true , ” cried marianne , in a cheerful voice , and walking to the window as she spoke , to examine the day . “ i had not thought of _that_ . this weather will keep many sportsmen in the country . ”
austen	sense	it was a lucky recollection , all her good spirits were restored by it . “ it is charming weather for _them_ indeed , ” she continued , as she sat down to the breakfast table with a happy countenance . “ how much they must enjoy it ! but ” ( with a little return of anxiety ) “ it can not be expected to last long . at this time of the year , and after such a series of rain , we shall certainly have very little more of it . frosts will soon set in , and in all probability with severity . in another day or two perhaps ; this extreme mildness can hardly last longer—nay , perhaps it may freeze tonight ! ”
austen	sense	“ at any rate , ” said elinor , wishing to prevent mrs. jennings from seeing her sister ’ s thoughts as clearly as she did , “ i dare say we shall have sir john and lady middleton in town by the end of next week . ”
austen	sense	“ ay , my dear , i ’ ll warrant you we do . mary always has her own way. ” “ and now , ” silently conjectured elinor , “ she will write to combe by this day ’ s post. ” but if she _did_ , the letter was written and sent away with a privacy which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain the fact . whatever the truth of it might be , and far as elinor was from feeling thorough contentment about it , yet while she saw marianne in spirits , she could not be very uncomfortable herself . and marianne was in spirits ; happy in the mildness of the weather , and still happier in her expectation of a frost .
austen	sense	the morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at the houses of mrs. jennings ’ s acquaintance to inform them of her being in town ; and marianne was all the time busy in observing the direction of the wind , watching the variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the air .
austen	sense	“ don ’ t you find it colder than it was in the morning , elinor ? there seems to me a very decided difference . i can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff . it was not so yesterday , i think . the clouds seem parting too , the sun will be out in a moment , and we shall have a clear afternoon . ”
austen	sense	elinor was alternately diverted and pained ; but marianne persevered , and saw every night in the brightness of the fire , and every morning in the appearance of the atmosphere , the certain symptoms of approaching frost .
austen	sense	the miss dashwoods had no greater reason to be dissatisfied with mrs. jennings ’ s style of living , and set of acquaintance , than with her behaviour to themselves , which was invariably kind . every thing in her household arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan , and excepting a few old city friends , whom , to lady middleton ’ s regret , she had never dropped , she visited no one to whom an introduction could at all discompose the feelings of her young companions . pleased to find herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she had expected , elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much real enjoyment from any of their evening parties , which , whether at home or abroad , formed only for cards , could have little to amuse her .
austen	sense	colonel brandon , who had a general invitation to the house , was with them almost every day ; he came to look at marianne and talk to elinor , who often derived more satisfaction from conversing with him than from any other daily occurrence , but who saw at the same time with much concern his continued regard for her sister . she feared it was a strengthening regard . it grieved her to see the earnestness with which he often watched marianne , and his spirits were certainly worse than when at barton .
austen	sense	about a week after their arrival , it became certain that willoughby was also arrived . his card was on the table when they came in from the morning ’ s drive . “ good god ! ” cried marianne , “ he has been here while we were out. ” elinor , rejoiced to be assured of his being in london , now ventured to say , “ depend upon it , he will call again tomorrow. ” but marianne seemed hardly to hear her , and on mrs. jennings ’ s entrance , escaped with the precious card .
austen	sense	this event , while it raised the spirits of elinor , restored to those of her sister all , and more than all , their former agitation . from this moment her mind was never quiet ; the expectation of seeing him every hour of the day , made her unfit for any thing . she insisted on being left behind , the next morning , when the others went out .
austen	sense	elinor ’ s thoughts were full of what might be passing in berkeley street during their absence ; but a moment ’ s glance at her sister when they returned was enough to inform her , that willoughby had paid no second visit there . a note was just then brought in , and laid on the table .
austen	sense	“ for me ! ” cried marianne , stepping hastily forward . “ no , ma ’ am , for my mistress. ” but marianne , not convinced , took it instantly up . “ it is indeed for mrs. jennings ; how provoking ! ” “ you are expecting a letter , then ? ” said elinor , unable to be longer silent .
austen	sense	“ yes , a little—not much. ” after a short pause . “ you have no confidence in me , marianne. ” “ nay , elinor , this reproach from _you_—you who have confidence in no one ! ” “ me ! ” returned elinor in some confusion ; “ indeed , marianne , i have nothing to tell . ”
austen	sense	“ nor i , ” answered marianne with energy , “ our situations then are alike . we have neither of us any thing to tell ; you , because you do not communicate , and i , because i conceal nothing . ”
austen	sense	elinor , distressed by this charge of reserve in herself , which she was not at liberty to do away , knew not how , under such circumstances , to press for greater openness in marianne .
austen	sense	mrs. jennings soon appeared , and the note being given her , she read it aloud . it was from lady middleton , announcing their arrival in conduit street the night before , and requesting the company of her mother and cousins the following evening . business on sir john ’ s part , and a violent cold on her own , prevented their calling in berkeley street . the invitation was accepted ; but when the hour of appointment drew near , necessary as it was in common civility to mrs. jennings , that they should both attend her on such a visit , elinor had some difficulty in persuading her sister to go , for still she had seen nothing of willoughby ; and therefore was not more indisposed for amusement abroad , than unwilling to run the risk of his calling again in her absence .
austen	sense	elinor found , when the evening was over , that disposition is not materially altered by a change of abode , for although scarcely settled in town , sir john had contrived to collect around him , nearly twenty young people , and to amuse them with a ball . this was an affair , however , of which lady middleton did not approve . in the country , an unpremeditated dance was very allowable ; but in london , where the reputation of elegance was more important and less easily attained , it was risking too much for the gratification of a few girls , to have it known that lady middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine couple , with two violins , and a mere side-board collation .
austen	sense	mr. and mrs. palmer were of the party ; from the former , whom they had not seen before since their arrival in town , as he was careful to avoid the appearance of any attention to his mother-in-law , and therefore never came near her , they received no mark of recognition on their entrance . he looked at them slightly , without seeming to know who they were , and merely nodded to mrs. jennings from the other side of the room . marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she entered : it was enough—_he_ was not there—and she sat down , equally ill-disposed to receive or communicate pleasure . after they had been assembled about an hour , mr. palmer sauntered towards the miss dashwoods to express his surprise on seeing them in town , though colonel brandon had been first informed of their arrival at his house , and he had himself said something very droll on hearing that they were to come .
austen	sense	“ i thought you were both in devonshire , ” said he . “ did you ? ” replied elinor . “ when do you go back again ? ” “ i do not know. ” and thus ended their discourse . never had marianne been so unwilling to dance in her life , as she was that evening , and never so much fatigued by the exercise . she complained of it as they returned to berkeley street .
austen	sense	“ aye , aye , ” said mrs. jennings , “ we know the reason of all that very well ; if a certain person who shall be nameless , had been there , you would not have been a bit tired : and to say the truth it was not very pretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited . ”
austen	sense	“ invited ! ” cried marianne . “ so my daughter middleton told me , for it seems sir john met him somewhere in the street this morning. ” marianne said no more , but looked exceedingly hurt . impatient in this situation to be doing something that might lead to her sister ’ s relief , elinor resolved to write the next morning to her mother , and hoped by awakening her fears for the health of marianne , to procure those inquiries which had been so long delayed ; and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure by perceiving after breakfast on the morrow , that marianne was again writing to willoughby , for she could not suppose it to be to any other person .
austen	sense	about the middle of the day , mrs. jennings went out by herself on business , and elinor began her letter directly , while marianne , too restless for employment , too anxious for conversation , walked from one window to the other , or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation . elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother , relating all that had passed , her suspicions of willoughby ’ s inconstancy , urging her by every plea of duty and affection to demand from marianne an account of her real situation with respect to him .
austen	sense	her letter was scarcely finished , when a rap foretold a visitor , and colonel brandon was announced . marianne , who had seen him from the window , and who hated company of any kind , left the room before he entered it . he looked more than usually grave , and though expressing satisfaction at finding miss dashwood alone , as if he had somewhat in particular to tell her , sat for some time without saying a word . elinor , persuaded that he had some communication to make in which her sister was concerned , impatiently expected its opening . it was not the first time of her feeling the same kind of conviction ; for , more than once before , beginning with the observation of “ your sister looks unwell to-day , ” or “ your sister seems out of spirits , ” he had appeared on the point , either of disclosing , or of inquiring , something particular about her . after a pause of several minutes , their silence was broken , by his asking her in a voice of some agitation , when he was to congratulate her on the acquisition of a brother ? elinor was not prepared for such a question , and having no answer ready , was obliged to adopt the simple and common expedient , of asking what he meant ? he tried to smile as he replied , “ your sister ’ s engagement to mr. willoughby is very generally known . ”
austen	sense	“ it can not be generally known , ” returned elinor , “ for her own family do not know it. ” he looked surprised and said , “ i beg your pardon , i am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent ; but i had not supposed any secrecy intended , as they openly correspond , and their marriage is universally talked of . ”
austen	sense	“ how can that be ? by whom can you have heard it mentioned ? ” “ by many—by some of whom you know nothing , by others with whom you are most intimate , mrs. jennings , mrs. palmer , and the middletons . but still i might not have believed it , for where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to be convinced , it will always find something to support its doubts , if i had not , when the servant let me in today , accidentally seen a letter in his hand , directed to mr. willoughby in your sister ’ s writing . i came to inquire , but i was convinced before i could ask the question . is every thing finally settled ? is it impossible to— ? but i have no right , and i could have no chance of succeeding . excuse me , miss dashwood . i believe i have been wrong in saying so much , but i hardly know what to do , and on your prudence i have the strongest dependence . tell me that it is all absolutely resolved on , that any attempt , that in short concealment , if concealment be possible , is all that remains . ”
austen	sense	these words , which conveyed to elinor a direct avowal of his love for her sister , affected her very much . she was not immediately able to say anything , and even when her spirits were recovered , she debated for a short time , on the answer it would be most proper to give . the real state of things between willoughby and her sister was so little known to herself , that in endeavouring to explain it , she might be as liable to say too much as too little . yet as she was convinced that marianne ’ s affection for willoughby , could leave no hope of colonel brandon ’ s success , whatever the event of that affection might be , and at the same time wished to shield her conduct from censure , she thought it most prudent and kind , after some consideration , to say more than she really knew or believed . she acknowledged , therefore , that though she had never been informed by themselves of the terms on which they stood with each other , of their mutual affection she had no doubt , and of their correspondence she was not astonished to hear .
austen	sense	he listened to her with silent attention , and on her ceasing to speak , rose directly from his seat , and after saying in a voice of emotion , “ to your sister i wish all imaginable happiness ; to willoughby that he may endeavour to deserve her , ” —took leave , and went away .
austen	sense	elinor derived no comfortable feelings from this conversation , to lessen the uneasiness of her mind on other points ; she was left , on the contrary , with a melancholy impression of colonel brandon ’ s unhappiness , and was prevented even from wishing it removed , by her anxiety for the very event that must confirm it .
austen	sense	chapter xxviii . nothing occurred during the next three or four days , to make elinor regret what she had done , in applying to her mother ; for willoughby neither came nor wrote . they were engaged about the end of that time to attend lady middleton to a party , from which mrs. jennings was kept away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter ; and for this party , marianne , wholly dispirited , careless of her appearance , and seeming equally indifferent whether she went or staid , prepared , without one look of hope or one expression of pleasure . she sat by the drawing-room fire after tea , till the moment of lady middleton ’ s arrival , without once stirring from her seat , or altering her attitude , lost in her own thoughts , and insensible of her sister ’ s presence ; and when at last they were told that lady middleton waited for them at the door , she started as if she had forgotten that any one was expected .
austen	sense	they arrived in due time at the place of destination , and as soon as the string of carriages before them would allow , alighted , ascended the stairs , heard their names announced from one landing-place to another in an audible voice , and entered a room splendidly lit up , quite full of company , and insufferably hot . when they had paid their tribute of politeness by curtsying to the lady of the house , they were permitted to mingle in the crowd , and take their share of the heat and inconvenience , to which their arrival must necessarily add . after some time spent in saying little or doing less , lady middleton sat down to cassino , and as marianne was not in spirits for moving about , she and elinor luckily succeeding to chairs , placed themselves at no great distance from the table .
austen	sense	they had not remained in this manner long , before elinor perceived willoughby , standing within a few yards of them , in earnest conversation with a very fashionable looking young woman . she soon caught his eye , and he immediately bowed , but without attempting to speak to her , or to approach marianne , though he could not but see her ; and then continued his discourse with the same lady . elinor turned involuntarily to marianne , to see whether it could be unobserved by her . at that moment she first perceived him , and her whole countenance glowing with sudden delight , she would have moved towards him instantly , had not her sister caught hold of her .
austen	sense	“ good heavens ! ” she exclaimed , “ he is there—he is there—oh ! why does he not look at me ? why can not i speak to him ? ” “ pray , pray be composed , ” cried elinor , “ and do not betray what you feel to every body present . perhaps he has not observed you yet . ”
austen	sense	this however was more than she could believe herself ; and to be composed at such a moment was not only beyond the reach of marianne , it was beyond her wish . she sat in an agony of impatience which affected every feature .
austen	sense	at last he turned round again , and regarded them both ; she started up , and pronouncing his name in a tone of affection , held out her hand to him . he approached , and addressing himself rather to elinor than marianne , as if wishing to avoid her eye , and determined not to observe her attitude , inquired in a hurried manner after mrs. dashwood , and asked how long they had been in town . elinor was robbed of all presence of mind by such an address , and was unable to say a word . but the feelings of her sister were instantly expressed . her face was crimsoned over , and she exclaimed , in a voice of the greatest emotion , “ good god ! willoughby , what is the meaning of this ? have you not received my letters ? will you not shake hands with me ? ”
austen	sense	he could not then avoid it , but her touch seemed painful to him , and he held her hand only for a moment . during all this time he was evidently struggling for composure . elinor watched his countenance and saw its expression becoming more tranquil . after a moment ’ s pause , he spoke with calmness .
austen	sense	“ i did myself the honour of calling in berkeley street last tuesday , and very much regretted that i was not fortunate enough to find yourselves and mrs. jennings at home . my card was not lost , i hope . ”
austen	sense	“ but have you not received my notes ? ” cried marianne in the wildest anxiety . “ here is some mistake i am sure—some dreadful mistake . what can be the meaning of it ? tell me , willoughby ; for heaven ’ s sake tell me , what is the matter ? ”
austen	sense	he made no reply ; his complexion changed and all his embarrassment returned ; but as if , on catching the eye of the young lady with whom he had been previously talking , he felt the necessity of instant exertion , he recovered himself again , and after saying , “ yes , i had the pleasure of receiving the information of your arrival in town , which you were so good as to send me , ” turned hastily away with a slight bow and joined his friend .
austen	sense	marianne , now looking dreadfully white , and unable to stand , sunk into her chair , and elinor , expecting every moment to see her faint , tried to screen her from the observation of others , while reviving her with lavender water .
austen	sense	“ go to him , elinor , ” she cried , as soon as she could speak , “ and force him to come to me . tell him i must see him again—must speak to him instantly.—i can not rest—i shall not have a moment ’ s peace till this is explained—some dreadful misapprehension or other . oh , go to him this moment . ”
austen	sense	“ how can that be done ? no , my dearest marianne , you must wait . this is not the place for explanations . wait only till tomorrow. ” with difficulty however could she prevent her from following him herself ; and to persuade her to check her agitation , to wait , at least , with the appearance of composure , till she might speak to him with more privacy and more effect , was impossible ; for marianne continued incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery of her feelings , by exclamations of wretchedness . in a short time elinor saw willoughby quit the room by the door towards the staircase , and telling marianne that he was gone , urged the impossibility of speaking to him again that evening , as a fresh argument for her to be calm . she instantly begged her sister would entreat lady middleton to take them home , as she was too miserable to stay a minute longer .
austen	sense	lady middleton , though in the middle of a rubber , on being informed that marianne was unwell , was too polite to object for a moment to her wish of going away , and making over her cards to a friend , they departed as soon as the carriage could be found . scarcely a word was spoken during their return to berkeley street . marianne was in a silent agony , too much oppressed even for tears ; but as mrs. jennings was luckily not come home , they could go directly to their own room , where hartshorn restored her a little to herself . she was soon undressed and in bed , and as she seemed desirous of being alone , her sister then left her , and while she waited the return of mrs. jennings , had leisure enough for thinking over the past .
austen	sense	that some kind of engagement had subsisted between willoughby and marianne she could not doubt , and that willoughby was weary of it , seemed equally clear ; for however marianne might still feed her own wishes , _she_ could not attribute such behaviour to mistake or misapprehension of any kind . nothing but a thorough change of sentiment could account for it . her indignation would have been still stronger than it was , had she not witnessed that embarrassment which seemed to speak a consciousness of his own misconduct , and prevented her from believing him so unprincipled as to have been sporting with the affections of her sister from the first , without any design that would bear investigation . absence might have weakened his regard , and convenience might have determined him to overcome it , but that such a regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself to doubt .
austen	sense	as for marianne , on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting must already have given her , and on those still more severe which might await her in its probable consequence , she could not reflect without the deepest concern . her own situation gained in the comparison ; for while she could _esteem_ edward as much as ever , however they might be divided in future , her mind might be always supported . but every circumstance that could embitter such an evil seemed uniting to heighten the misery of marianne in a final separation from willoughby—in an immediate and irreconcilable rupture with him .
austen	sense	chapter xxix . before the housemaid had lit their fire the next day , or the sun gained any power over a cold , gloomy morning in january , marianne , only half dressed , was kneeling against one of the window-seats for the sake of all the little light she could command from it , and writing as fast as a continual flow of tears would permit her . in this situation , elinor , roused from sleep by her agitation and sobs , first perceived her ; and after observing her for a few moments with silent anxiety , said , in a tone of the most considerate gentleness ,
austen	sense	“ marianne , may i ask— ? ” “ no , elinor , ” she replied , “ ask nothing ; you will soon know all. ” the sort of desperate calmness with which this was said , lasted no longer than while she spoke , and was immediately followed by a return of the same excessive affliction . it was some minutes before she could go on with her letter , and the frequent bursts of grief which still obliged her , at intervals , to withhold her pen , were proofs enough of her feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing for the last time to willoughby .
austen	sense	elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her power ; and she would have tried to sooth and tranquilize her still more , had not marianne entreated her , with all the eagerness of the most nervous irritability , not to speak to her for the world . in such circumstances , it was better for both that they should not be long together ; and the restless state of marianne ’ s mind not only prevented her from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed , but requiring at once solitude and continual change of place , made her wander about the house till breakfast time , avoiding the sight of every body .
austen	sense	at breakfast she neither ate , nor attempted to eat any thing ; and elinor ’ s attention was then all employed , not in urging her , not in pitying her , nor in appearing to regard her , but in endeavouring to engage mrs. jennings ’ s notice entirely to herself .
austen	sense	as this was a favourite meal with mrs. jennings , it lasted a considerable time , and they were just setting themselves , after it , round the common working table , when a letter was delivered to marianne , which she eagerly caught from the servant , and , turning of a death-like paleness , instantly ran out of the room . elinor , who saw as plainly by this , as if she had seen the direction , that it must come from willoughby , felt immediately such a sickness at heart as made her hardly able to hold up her head , and sat in such a general tremour as made her fear it impossible to escape mrs. jennings ’ s notice . that good lady , however , saw only that marianne had received a letter from willoughby , which appeared to her a very good joke , and which she treated accordingly , by hoping , with a laugh , that she would find it to her liking . of elinor ’ s distress , she was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted for her rug , to see any thing at all ; and calmly continuing her talk , as soon as marianne disappeared , she said ,
austen	sense	“ upon my word , i never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my life ! _my_ girls were nothing to her , and yet they used to be foolish enough ; but as for miss marianne , she is quite an altered creature . i hope , from the bottom of my heart , he won ’ t keep her waiting much longer , for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn . pray , when are they to be married ? ”
austen	sense	elinor , though never less disposed to speak than at that moment , obliged herself to answer such an attack as this , and , therefore , trying to smile , replied , “ and have you really , ma ’ am , talked yourself into a persuasion of my sister ’ s being engaged to mr. willoughby ? i thought it had been only a joke , but so serious a question seems to imply more ; and i must beg , therefore , that you will not deceive yourself any longer . i do assure you that nothing would surprise me more than to hear of their being going to be married . ”

christie	ackroyd	the murder of roger ackroyd chapter i dr. sheppard at the breakfast table mrs. ferrars died on the night of the 16th–17th september—a thursday . i was sent for at eight o ’ clock on the morning of friday the 17th . there was nothing to be done . she had been dead some hours .
christie	ackroyd	it was just a few minutes after nine when i reached home once more . i opened the front door with my latch-key , and purposely delayed a few moments in the hall , hanging up my hat and the light overcoat that i had deemed a wise precaution against the chill of an early autumn morning . to tell the truth , i was considerably upset and worried . i am not going to pretend that at that moment i foresaw the events of the next few weeks . i emphatically did not do so . but my instinct told me that there were stirring times ahead .
christie	ackroyd	from the dining-room on my left there came the rattle of tea-cups and the short , dry cough of my sister caroline . “ is that you , james ? ” she called . an unnecessary question , since who else could it be ? to tell the truth , it was precisely my sister caroline who was the cause of my few minutes ’ delay . the motto of the mongoose family , so mr. kipling tells us , is : “ go and find out. ” if caroline ever adopts a crest , i should certainly suggest a mongoose rampant . one might omit the first part of the motto . caroline can do any amount of finding out by sitting placidly at home . i don ’ t know how she manages it , but there it is . i suspect that the servants and the tradesmen constitute her intelligence corps . when she goes out , it is not to gather in information , but to spread it . at that , too , she is amazingly expert .
christie	ackroyd	it was really this last named trait of hers which was causing me these pangs of indecision . whatever i told caroline now concerning the demise of mrs. ferrars would be common knowledge all over the village within the space of an hour and a half . as a professional man , i naturally aim at discretion . therefore i have got into the habit of continually withholding all information possible from my sister . she usually finds out just the same , but i have the moral satisfaction of knowing that i am in no way to blame .
christie	ackroyd	mrs. ferrars ’ husband died just over a year ago , and caroline has constantly asserted , without the least foundation for the assertion , that his wife poisoned him . she scorns my invariable rejoinder that mr. ferrars died of acute gastritis , helped on by habitual over-indulgence in alcoholic beverages . the symptoms of gastritis and arsenical poisoning are not , i agree , unlike , but caroline bases her accusation on quite different lines .
christie	ackroyd	“ you ’ ve only got to look at her , ” i have heard her say . mrs. ferrars , though not in her first youth , was a very attractive woman , and her clothes , though simple , always seemed to fit her very well , but all the same , lots of women buy their clothes in paris and have not , on that account , necessarily poisoned their husbands .
christie	ackroyd	as i stood hesitating in the hall , with all this passing through my mind , caroline ’ s voice came again , with a sharper note in it . “ what on earth are you doing out there , james ? why don ’ t you come and get your breakfast ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ just coming , my dear , ” i said hastily . “ i ’ ve been hanging up my overcoat. ” “ you could have hung up half a dozen overcoats in this time. ” she was quite right . i could have .
christie	ackroyd	i walked into the dining-room , gave caroline the accustomed peck on the cheek , and sat down to eggs and bacon . the bacon was rather cold . “ you ’ ve had an early call , ” remarked caroline .
christie	ackroyd	“ yes , ” i said . “ king ’ s paddock . mrs. ferrars. ” “ i know , ” said my sister . “ how did you know ? ” “ annie told me. ” annie is the house parlormaid . a nice girl , but an inveterate talker .
christie	ackroyd	there was a pause . i continued to eat eggs and bacon . my sister ’ s nose , which is long and thin , quivered a little at the tip , as it always does when she is interested or excited over anything .
christie	ackroyd	“ well ? ” she demanded . “ a bad business . nothing to be done . must have died in her sleep. ” “ i know , ” said my sister again . this time i was annoyed . “ you can ’ t know , ” i snapped . “ i didn ’ t know myself until i got there , and i haven ’ t mentioned it to a soul yet . if that girl annie knows , she must be a clairvoyant . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ it wasn ’ t annie who told me . it was the milkman . he had it from the ferrars ’ cook. ” as i say , there is no need for caroline to go out to get information . she sits at home , and it comes to her .
christie	ackroyd	my sister continued : “ what did she die of ? heart failure ? ” “ didn ’ t the milkman tell you that ? ” i inquired sarcastically . sarcasm is wasted on caroline . she takes it seriously and answers accordingly .
christie	ackroyd	“ he didn ’ t know , ” she explained . after all , caroline was bound to hear sooner or later . she might as well hear from me . “ she died of an overdose of veronal . she ’ s been taking it lately for sleeplessness . must have taken too much . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ nonsense , ” said caroline immediately . “ she took it on purpose . don ’ t tell me ! ” it is odd how , when you have a secret belief of your own which you do not wish to acknowledge , the voicing of it by some one else will rouse you to a fury of denial . i burst immediately into indignant speech .
christie	ackroyd	“ there you go again , ” i said . “ rushing along without rhyme or reason . why on earth should mrs. ferrars wish to commit suicide ? a widow , fairly young still , very well off , good health , and nothing to do but enjoy life . it ’ s absurd . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ not at all . even you must have noticed how different she has been looking lately . it ’ s been coming on for the last six months . she ’ s looked positively hag-ridden . and you have just admitted that she hasn ’ t been able to sleep . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ what is your diagnosis ? ” i demanded coldly . “ an unfortunate love affair , i suppose ? ” my sister shook her head . “ _remorse_ , ” she said , with great gusto . “ remorse ? ” “ yes . you never would believe me when i told you she poisoned her husband . i ’ m more than ever convinced of it now . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i don ’ t think you ’ re very logical , ” i objected . “ surely if a woman committed a crime like murder , she ’ d be sufficiently cold-blooded to enjoy the fruits of it without any weak-minded sentimentality such as repentance . ”
christie	ackroyd	caroline shook her head . “ there probably are women like that—but mrs. ferrars wasn ’ t one of them . she was a mass of nerves . an overmastering impulse drove her on to get rid of her husband because she was the sort of person who simply can ’ t endure suffering of any kind , and there ’ s no doubt that the wife of a man like ashley ferrars must have had to suffer a good deal—— ”
christie	ackroyd	i nodded . “ and ever since she ’ s been haunted by what she did . i can ’ t help feeling sorry for her. ” i don ’ t think caroline ever felt sorry for mrs. ferrars whilst she was alive . now that she has gone where ( presumably ) paris frocks can no longer be worn , caroline is prepared to indulge in the softer emotions of pity and comprehension .
christie	ackroyd	i told her firmly that her whole idea was nonsense . i was all the more firm because i secretly agreed with some part , at least , of what she had said . but it is all wrong that caroline should arrive at the truth simply by a kind of inspired guesswork . i wasn ’ t going to encourage that sort of thing . she will go round the village airing her views , and every one will think that she is doing so on medical data supplied by me . life is very trying .
christie	ackroyd	“ nonsense , ” said caroline , in reply to my strictures . “ you ’ ll see . ten to one she ’ s left a letter confessing everything. ” “ she didn ’ t leave a letter of any kind , ” i said sharply , and not seeing where the admission was going to land me .
christie	ackroyd	“ oh ! ” said caroline . “ so you _did_ inquire about that , did you ? i believe , james , that in your heart of hearts , you think very much as i do . you ’ re a precious old humbug . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ one always has to take the possibility of suicide into consideration , ” i said repressively . “ will there be an inquest ? ” “ there may be . it all depends . if i am able to declare myself absolutely satisfied that the overdose was taken accidentally , an inquest might be dispensed with . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ and are you absolutely satisfied ? ” asked my sister shrewdly . i did not answer , but got up from table . chapter ii who ’ s who in king ’ s abbot before i proceed further with what i said to caroline and what caroline said to me , it might be as well to give some idea of what i should describe as our local geography . our village , king ’ s abbot , is , i imagine , very much like any other village . our big town is cranchester , nine miles away . we have a large railway station , a small post office , and two rival “ general stores. ” able-bodied men are apt to leave the place early in life , but we are rich in unmarried ladies and retired military officers . our hobbies and recreations can be summed up in the one word , “ gossip . ”
christie	ackroyd	there are only two houses of any importance in king ’ s abbot . one is king ’ s paddock , left to mrs. ferrars by her late husband . the other , fernly park , is owned by roger ackroyd . ackroyd has always interested me by being a man more impossibly like a country squire than any country squire could really be . he reminds one of the red-faced sportsmen who always appeared early in the first act of an old-fashioned musical comedy , the setting being the village green . they usually sang a song about going up to london . nowadays we have revues , and the country squire has died out of musical fashion .
christie	ackroyd	of course , ackroyd is not really a country squire . he is an immensely successful manufacturer of ( i think ) wagon wheels . he is a man of nearly fifty years of age , rubicund of face and genial of manner . he is hand and glove with the vicar , subscribes liberally to parish funds ( though rumor has it that he is extremely mean in personal expenditure ) , encourages cricket matches , lads ’ clubs , and disabled soldiers ’ institutes . he is , in fact , the life and soul of our peaceful village of king ’ s abbot .
christie	ackroyd	now when roger ackroyd was a lad of twenty-one , he fell in love with , and married , a beautiful woman some five or six years his senior . her name was paton , and she was a widow with one child . the history of the marriage was short and painful . to put it bluntly , mrs. ackroyd was a dipsomaniac . she succeeded in drinking herself into her grave four years after her marriage .
christie	ackroyd	in the years that followed , ackroyd showed no disposition to make a second matrimonial adventure . his wife ’ s child by her first marriage was only seven years old when his mother died . he is now twenty-five . ackroyd has always regarded him as his own son , and has brought him up accordingly , but he has been a wild lad and a continual source of worry and trouble to his stepfather . nevertheless we are all very fond of ralph paton in king ’ s abbot . he is such a good-looking youngster for one thing .
christie	ackroyd	as i said before , we are ready enough to gossip in our village . everybody noticed from the first that ackroyd and mrs. ferrars got on very well together . after her husband ’ s death , the intimacy became more marked . they were always seen about together , and it was freely conjectured that at the end of her period of mourning , mrs. ferrars would become mrs. roger ackroyd . it was felt , indeed , that there was a certain fitness in the thing . roger ackroyd ’ s wife had admittedly died of drink . ashley ferrars had been a drunkard for many years before his death . it was only fitting that these two victims of alcoholic excess should make up to each other for all that they had previously endured at the hands of their former spouses .
christie	ackroyd	the ferrars only came to live here just over a year ago , but a halo of gossip has surrounded ackroyd for many years past . all the time that ralph paton was growing up to manhood , a series of lady housekeepers presided over ackroyd ’ s establishment , and each in turn was regarded with lively suspicion by caroline and her cronies . it is not too much to say that for at least fifteen years the whole village has confidently expected ackroyd to marry one of his housekeepers . the last of them , a redoubtable lady called miss russell , has reigned undisputed for five years , twice as long as any of her predecessors . it is felt that but for the advent of mrs. ferrars , ackroyd could hardly have escaped . that—and one other factor—the unexpected arrival of a widowed sister-in-law with her daughter from canada . mrs. cecil ackroyd , widow of ackroyd ’ s ne ’ er-do-well younger brother , has taken up her residence at fernly park , and has succeeded , according to caroline , in putting miss russell in her proper place .
christie	ackroyd	i don ’ t know exactly what a “ proper place ” constitutes—it sounds chilly and unpleasant—but i know that miss russell goes about with pinched lips , and what i can only describe as an acid smile , and that she professes the utmost sympathy for “ poor mrs. ackroyd—dependent on the charity of her husband ’ s brother . the bread of charity is so bitter , is it not ? _i_ should be quite miserable if i did not work for my living . ”
christie	ackroyd	i don ’ t know what mrs. cecil ackroyd thought of the ferrars affair when it came on the tapis . it was clearly to her advantage that ackroyd should remain unmarried . she was always very charming—not to say gushing—to mrs. ferrars when they met . caroline says that proves less than nothing .
christie	ackroyd	such have been our preoccupations in king ’ s abbot for the last few years . we have discussed ackroyd and his affairs from every standpoint . mrs. ferrars has fitted into her place in the scheme .
christie	ackroyd	now there has been a rearrangement of the kaleidoscope . from a mild discussion of probable wedding presents , we have been jerked into the midst of tragedy . revolving these and sundry other matters in my mind , i went mechanically on my round . i had no cases of special interest to attend , which was , perhaps , as well , for my thoughts returned again and again to the mystery of mrs. ferrars ’ s death . had she taken her own life ? surely , if she had done so , she would have left some word behind to say what she contemplated doing ? women , in my experience , if they once reach the determination to commit suicide , usually wish to reveal the state of mind that led to the fatal action . they covet the limelight .
christie	ackroyd	when had i last seen her ? not for over a week . her manner then had been normal enough considering—well—considering everything . then i suddenly remembered that i had seen her , though not to speak to , only yesterday . she had been walking with ralph paton , and i had been surprised because i had had no idea that he was likely to be in king ’ s abbot . i thought , indeed , that he had quarreled finally with his stepfather . nothing had been seen of him down here for nearly six months . they had been walking along , side by side , their heads close together , and she had been talking very earnestly .
christie	ackroyd	i think i can safely say that it was at this moment that a foreboding of the future first swept over me . nothing tangible as yet—but a vague premonition of the way things were setting . that earnest _tête-à-tête_ between ralph paton and mrs. ferrars the day before struck me disagreeably .
christie	ackroyd	i was still thinking of it when i came face to face with roger ackroyd . “ sheppard ! ” he exclaimed . “ just the man i wanted to get hold of . this is a terrible business . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ you ’ ve heard then ? ” he nodded . he had felt the blow keenly , i could see . his big red cheeks seemed to have fallen in , and he looked a positive wreck of his usual jolly , healthy self .
christie	ackroyd	“ it ’ s worse than you know , ” he said quietly . “ look here , sheppard , i ’ ve got to talk to you . can you come back with me now ? ” “ hardly . i ’ ve got three patients to see still , and i must be back by twelve to see my surgery patients . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ then this afternoon—no , better still , dine to-night . at 7.30 ? will that suit you ? ” “ yes—i can manage that all right . what ’ s wrong ? is it ralph ? ” i hardly knew why i said that—except , perhaps , that it had so often been ralph .
christie	ackroyd	ackroyd stared blankly at me as though he hardly understood . i began to realize that there must be something very wrong indeed somewhere . i had never seen ackroyd so upset before .
christie	ackroyd	“ ralph ? ” he said vaguely . “ oh ! no , it ’ s not ralph . ralph ’ s in london——damn ! here ’ s old miss ganett coming . i don ’ t want to have to talk to her about this ghastly business . see you to-night , sheppard . seven-thirty . ”
christie	ackroyd	i nodded , and he hurried away , leaving me wondering . ralph in london ? but he had certainly been in king ’ s abbot the preceding afternoon . he must have gone back to town last night or early this morning , and yet ackroyd ’ s manner had conveyed quite a different impression . he had spoken as though ralph had not been near the place for months .
christie	ackroyd	i had no time to puzzle the matter out further . miss ganett was upon me , thirsting for information . miss ganett has all the characteristics of my sister caroline , but she lacks that unerring aim in jumping to conclusions which lends a touch of greatness to caroline ’ s maneuvers . miss ganett was breathless and interrogatory .
christie	ackroyd	wasn ’ t it sad about poor dear mrs. ferrars ? a lot of people were saying she had been a confirmed drug-taker for years . so wicked the way people went about saying things . and yet , the worst of it was , there was usually a grain of truth somewhere in these wild statements . no smoke without fire ! they were saying too that mr. ackroyd had found out about it , and had broken off the engagement—because there _was_ an engagement . she , miss ganett , had proof positive of that . of course _i_ must know all about it—doctors always did—but they never tell ?
christie	ackroyd	and all this with a sharp beady eye on me to see how i reacted to these suggestions . fortunately long association with caroline has led me to preserve an impassive countenance , and to be ready with small non-committal remarks .
christie	ackroyd	on this occasion i congratulated miss ganett on not joining in ill-natured gossip . rather a neat counterattack , i thought . it left her in difficulties , and before she could pull herself together , i had passed on .
christie	ackroyd	i went home thoughtful , to find several patients waiting for me in the surgery . i had dismissed the last of them , as i thought , and was just contemplating a few minutes in the garden before lunch when i perceived one more patient waiting for me . she rose and came towards me as i stood somewhat surprised .
christie	ackroyd	i don ’ t know why i should have been , except that there is a suggestion of cast iron about miss russell , a something that is above the ills of the flesh .
christie	ackroyd	ackroyd ’ s housekeeper is a tall woman , handsome but forbidding in appearance . she has a stern eye , and lips that shut tightly , and i feel that if i were an under housemaid or a kitchenmaid i should run for my life whenever i heard her coming .
christie	ackroyd	“ good morning , dr. sheppard , ” said miss russell . “ i should be much obliged if you would take a look at my knee. ” i took a look , but , truth to tell , i was very little wiser when i had done so . miss russell ’ s account of vague pains was so unconvincing that with a woman of less integrity of character i should have suspected a trumped-up tale . it did cross my mind for one moment that miss russell might have deliberately invented this affection of the knee in order to pump me on the subject of mrs. ferrars ’ s death , but i soon saw that there , at least , i had misjudged her . she made a brief reference to the tragedy , nothing more . yet she certainly seemed disposed to linger and chat .
christie	ackroyd	“ well , thank you very much for this bottle of liniment , doctor , ” she said at last . “ not that i believe it will do the least good. ” i didn ’ t think it would either , but i protested in duty bound . after all , it couldn ’ t do any harm , and one must stick up for the tools of one ’ s trade .
christie	ackroyd	“ i don ’ t believe in all these drugs , ” said miss russell , her eyes sweeping over my array of bottles disparagingly . “ drugs do a lot of harm . look at the cocaine habit . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ well , as far as that goes—— ” “ it ’ s very prevalent in high society. ” i ’ m sure miss russell knows far more about high society than i do . i didn ’ t attempt to argue with her .
christie	ackroyd	“ just tell me this , doctor , ” said miss russell . “ suppose you are really a slave of the drug habit . is there any cure ? ” one can not answer a question like that offhand . i gave her a short lecture on the subject , and she listened with close attention . i still suspected her of seeking information about mrs. ferrars .
christie	ackroyd	“ now , veronal , for instance—— ” i proceeded . but , strangely enough , she didn ’ t seem interested in veronal . instead she changed the subject , and asked me if it was true that there were certain poisons so rare as to baffle detection .
christie	ackroyd	“ ah ! ” i said . “ you ’ ve been reading detective stories. ” she admitted that she had . “ the essence of a detective story , ” i said , “ is to have a rare poison—if possible something from south america , that nobody has ever heard of—something that one obscure tribe of savages use to poison their arrows with . death is instantaneous , and western science is powerless to detect it . that is the kind of thing you mean ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ yes . is there really such a thing ? ” i shook my head regretfully . “ i ’ m afraid there isn ’ t . there ’ s _curare_ , of course. ” i told her a good deal about curare , but she seemed to have lost interest once more . she asked me if i had any in my poison cupboard , and when i replied in the negative i fancy i fell in her estimation .
christie	ackroyd	she said she must be getting back , and i saw her out at the surgery door just as the luncheon gong went . i should never have suspected miss russell of a fondness for detective stories . it pleases me very much to think of her stepping out of the housekeeper ’ s room to rebuke a delinquent housemaid , and then returning to a comfortable perusal of _the mystery of the seventh death_ , or something of the kind .
christie	ackroyd	chapter iii the man who grew vegetable marrows i told caroline at lunch time that i should be dining at fernly . she expressed no objection—on the contrary—— “ excellent , ” she said . “ you ’ ll hear all about it . by the way , what is the trouble with ralph ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ with ralph ? ” i said , surprised ; “ there ’ s isn ’ t any. ” “ then why is he staying at the three boars instead of at fernly park ? ” i did not for a minute question caroline ’ s statement that ralph paton was staying at the local inn . that caroline said so was enough for me .
christie	ackroyd	“ ackroyd told me he was in london , ” i said . in the surprise of the moment i departed from my valuable rule of never parting with information . “ oh ! ” said caroline . i could see her nose twitching as she worked on this .
christie	ackroyd	“ he arrived at the three boars yesterday morning , ” she said . “ and he ’ s still there . last night he was out with a girl. ” that did not surprise me in the least . ralph , i should say , is out with a girl most nights of his life . but i did rather wonder that he chose to indulge in the pastime in king ’ s abbot instead of in the gay metropolis .
christie	ackroyd	“ one of the barmaids ? ” i asked . “ no . that ’ s just it . he went out to meet her . i don ’ t know who she is. ” ( bitter for caroline to have to admit such a thing . )
christie	ackroyd	“ but i can guess , ” continued my indefatigable sister . i waited patiently . “ his cousin. ” “ flora ackroyd ? ” i exclaimed in surprise . flora ackroyd is , of course , no relation whatever really to ralph paton , but ralph has been looked upon for so long as practically ackroyd ’ s own son , that cousinship is taken for granted .
christie	ackroyd	“ flora ackroyd , ” said my sister . “ but why not go to fernly if he wanted to see her ? ” “ secretly engaged , ” said caroline , with immense enjoyment . “ old ackroyd won ’ t hear of it , and they have to meet this way . ”
christie	ackroyd	i saw a good many flaws in caroline ’ s theory , but i forbore to point them out to her . an innocent remark about our new neighbor created a diversion . the house next door , the larches , has recently been taken by a stranger . to caroline ’ s extreme annoyance , she has not been able to find out anything about him , except that he is a foreigner . the intelligence corps has proved a broken reed . presumably the man has milk and vegetables and joints of meat and occasional whitings just like everybody else , but none of the people who make it their business to supply these things seem to have acquired any information . his name , apparently , is mr. porrott—a name which conveys an odd feeling of unreality . the one thing we do know about him is that he is interested in the growing of vegetable marrows .
christie	ackroyd	but that is certainly not the sort of information that caroline is after . she wants to know where he comes from , what he does , whether he is married , what his wife was , or is , like , whether he has children , what his mother ’ s maiden name was—and so on . somebody very like caroline must have invented the questions on passports , i think .
christie	ackroyd	“ my dear caroline , ” i said . “ there ’ s no doubt at all about what the man ’ s profession has been . he ’ s a retired hairdresser . look at that mustache of his. ” caroline dissented . she said that if the man was a hairdresser , he would have wavy hair—not straight . all hairdressers did .
christie	ackroyd	i cited several hairdressers personally known to me who had straight hair , but caroline refused to be convinced . “ i can ’ t make him out at all , ” she said in an aggrieved voice . “ i borrowed some garden tools the other day , and he was most polite , but i couldn ’ t get anything out of him . i asked him point blank at last whether he was a frenchman , and he said he wasn ’ t—and somehow i didn ’ t like to ask him any more . ”
christie	ackroyd	i began to be more interested in our mysterious neighbor . a man who is capable of shutting up caroline and sending her , like the queen of sheba , empty away must be something of a personality .
christie	ackroyd	“ i believe , ” said caroline , “ that he ’ s got one of those new vacuum cleaners—— ” i saw a meditated loan and the opportunity of further questioning gleaming from her eye . i seized the chance to escape into the garden . i am rather fond of gardening . i was busily exterminating dandelion roots when a shout of warning sounded from close by and a heavy body whizzed by my ear and fell at my feet with a repellant squelch . it was a vegetable marrow !
christie	ackroyd	i looked up angrily . over the wall , to my left , there appeared a face . an egg-shaped head , partially covered with suspiciously black hair , two immense mustaches , and a pair of watchful eyes . it was our mysterious neighbor , mr. porrott .
christie	ackroyd	he broke at once into fluent apologies . “ i demand of you a thousand pardons , monsieur . i am without defense . for some months now i cultivate the marrows . this morning suddenly i enrage myself with these marrows . i send them to promenade themselves—alas ! not only mentally but physically . i seize the biggest . i hurl him over the wall . monsieur , i am ashamed . i prostrate myself . ”
christie	ackroyd	before such profuse apologies , my anger was forced to melt . after all , the wretched vegetable hadn ’ t hit me . but i sincerely hoped that throwing large vegetables over walls was not our new friend ’ s hobby . such a habit could hardly endear him to us as a neighbor .
christie	ackroyd	the strange little man seemed to read my thoughts . “ ah ! no , ” he exclaimed . “ do not disquiet yourself . it is not with me a habit . but can you figure to yourself , monsieur , that a man may work towards a certain object , may labor and toil to attain a certain kind of leisure and occupation , and then find that , after all , he yearns for the old busy days , and the old occupations that he thought himself so glad to leave ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ yes , ” i said slowly . “ i fancy that that is a common enough occurrence . i myself am perhaps an instance . a year ago i came into a legacy—enough to enable me to realize a dream . i have always wanted to travel , to see the world . well , that was a year ago , as i said , and—i am still here . ”
christie	ackroyd	my little neighbor nodded . “ the chains of habit . we work to attain an object , and the object gained , we find that what we miss is the daily toil . and mark you , monsieur , my work was interesting work . the most interesting work there is in the world . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ yes ? ” i said encouragingly . for the moment the spirit of caroline was strong within me . “ the study of human nature , monsieur ! ” “ just so , ” i said kindly . clearly a retired hairdresser . who knows the secrets of human nature better than a hairdresser ?
christie	ackroyd	“ also , i had a friend—a friend who for many years never left my side . occasionally of an imbecility to make one afraid , nevertheless he was very dear to me . figure to yourself that i miss even his stupidity . his _naïveté_ , his honest outlook , the pleasure of delighting and surprising him by my superior gifts—all these i miss more than i can tell you . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ he died ? ” i asked sympathetically . “ not so . he lives and flourishes—but on the other side of the world . he is now in the argentine. ” “ in the argentine , ” i said enviously .
christie	ackroyd	i have always wanted to go to south america . i sighed , and then looked up to find mr. porrott eyeing me sympathetically . he seemed an understanding little man . “ you will go there , yes ? ” he asked .
christie	ackroyd	i shook my head with a sigh . “ i could have gone , ” i said , “ a year ago . but i was foolish—and worse than foolish—greedy . i risked the substance for the shadow . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i comprehend , ” said mr. porrott . “ you speculated ? ” i nodded mournfully , but in spite of myself i felt secretly entertained . this ridiculous little man was so portentously solemn . “ not the porcupine oilfields ? ” he asked suddenly .
christie	ackroyd	i stared . “ i thought of them , as a matter of fact , but in the end i plumped for a gold mine in western australia. ” my neighbor was regarding me with a strange expression which i could not fathom .
christie	ackroyd	“ it is fate , ” he said at last . “ what is fate ? ” i asked irritably . “ that i should live next to a man who seriously considers porcupine oilfields , and also west australian gold mines . tell me , have you also a penchant for auburn hair ? ”
christie	ackroyd	i stared at him open-mouthed , and he burst out laughing . “ no , no , it is not the insanity that i suffer from . make your mind easy . it was a foolish question that i put to you there , for , see you , my friend of whom i spoke was a young man , a man who thought all women good , and most of them beautiful . but you are a man of middle age , a doctor , a man who knows the folly and the vanity of most things in this life of ours . well , well , we are neighbors . i beg of you to accept and present to your excellent sister my best marrow . ”
christie	ackroyd	he stooped , and with a flourish produced an immense specimen of the tribe , which i duly accepted in the spirit in which it was offered . “ indeed , ” said the little man cheerfully , “ this has not been a wasted morning . i have made the acquaintance of a man who in some ways resembles my far-off friend . by the way , i should like to ask you a question . you doubtless know every one in this tiny village . who is the young man with the very dark hair and eyes , and the handsome face . he walks with his head flung back , and an easy smile on his lips ? ”
christie	ackroyd	the description left me in no doubt . “ that must be captain ralph paton , ” i said slowly . “ i have not seen him about here before ? ” “ no , he has not been here for some time . but he is the son—adopted son , rather—of mr. ackroyd of fernly park . ”
christie	ackroyd	my neighbor made a slight gesture of impatience . “ of course , i should have guessed . mr. ackroyd spoke of him many times. ” “ you know mr. ackroyd ? ” i said , slightly surprised . “ mr . ackroyd knew me in london—when i was at work there . i have asked him to say nothing of my profession down here . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i see , ” i said , rather amused by this patent snobbery , as i thought it . but the little man went on with an almost grandiloquent smirk . “ one prefers to remain incognito . i am not anxious for notoriety . i have not even troubled to correct the local version of my name . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ indeed , ” i said , not knowing quite what to say . “ captain ralph paton , ” mused mr. porrott . “ and so he is engaged to mr. ackroyd ’ s niece , the charming miss flora. ” “ who told you so ? ” i asked , very much surprised .
christie	ackroyd	“ mr . ackroyd . about a week ago . he is very pleased about it—has long desired that such a thing should come to pass , or so i understood from him . i even believe that he brought some pressure to bear upon the young man . that is never wise . a young man should marry to please himself—not to please a stepfather from whom he has expectations . ”
christie	ackroyd	my ideas were completely upset . i could not see ackroyd taking a hairdresser into his confidence , and discussing the marriage of his niece and stepson with him . ackroyd extends a genial patronage to the lower orders , but he has a very great sense of his own dignity . i began to think that porrott couldn ’ t be a hairdresser after all .
christie	ackroyd	to hide my confusion , i said the first thing that came into my head . “ what made you notice ralph paton ? his good looks ? ” “ no , not that alone—though he is unusually good-looking for an englishman—what your lady novelists would call a greek god . no , there was something about that young man that i did not understand . ”
christie	ackroyd	he said the last sentence in a musing tone of voice which made an indefinable impression upon me . it was as though he was summing up the boy by the light of some inner knowledge that i did not share . it was that impression that was left with me , for at that moment my sister ’ s voice called me from the house .
christie	ackroyd	i went in . caroline had her hat on , and had evidently just come in from the village . she began without preamble . “ i met mr. ackroyd. ” “ yes ? ” i said . “ i stopped him , of course , but he seemed in a great hurry , and anxious to get away . ”
christie	ackroyd	i have no doubt but that that was the case . he would feel towards caroline much as he had felt towards miss ganett earlier in the day—perhaps more so . caroline is less easy to shake off .
christie	ackroyd	“ i asked him at once about ralph . he was absolutely astonished . had no idea the boy was down here . he actually said he thought i must have made a mistake . i ! a mistake ! ”
christie	ackroyd	“ ridiculous , ” i said . “ he ought to have known you better. ” “ then he went on to tell me that ralph and flora are engaged. ” “ i know that too , ” i interrupted , with modest pride .
christie	ackroyd	“ who told you ? ” “ our new neighbor. ” caroline visibly wavered for a second or two , much as a roulette ball might coyly hover between two numbers . then she declined the tempting red herring .
christie	ackroyd	“ i told mr. ackroyd that ralph was staying at the three boars. ” “ caroline , ” i said , “ do you never reflect that you might do a lot of harm with this habit of yours of repeating everything indiscriminately ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ nonsense , ” said my sister . “ people ought to know things . i consider it my duty to tell them . mr. ackroyd was very grateful to me. ” “ well ? ” i said , for there was clearly more to come .
christie	ackroyd	“ i think he went straight off to the three boars , but if so he didn ’ t find ralph there. ” “ no ? ” “ no . because as i was coming back through the wood—— ” “ coming back through the wood ? ” i interrupted .
christie	ackroyd	caroline had the grace to blush . “ it was such a lovely day , ” she exclaimed . “ i thought i would make a little round . the woods with their autumnal tints are so perfect at this time of year . ”
christie	ackroyd	caroline does not care a hang for woods at any time of year . normally she regards them as places where you get your feet damp , and where all kinds of unpleasant things may drop on your head . no , it was good sound mongoose instinct which took her to our local wood . it is the only place adjacent to the village of king ’ s abbot where you can talk with a young woman unseen by the whole of the village . it adjoins the park of fernly .
christie	ackroyd	“ well , ” i said , “ go on. ” “ as i say , i was just coming back through the wood when i heard voices. ” caroline paused . “ yes ? ” “ one was ralph paton ’ s—i knew it at once . the other was a girl ’ s . of course i didn ’ t mean to listen—— ”
christie	ackroyd	“ of course not , ” i interjected , with patent sarcasm—which was , however , wasted on caroline . “ but i simply couldn ’ t help overhearing . the girl said something—i didn ’ t quite catch what it was , and ralph answered . he sounded very angry . ‘ my dear girl , ’ he said . ‘ don ’ t you realize that it is quite on the cards the old man will cut me off with a shilling ? he ’ s been pretty fed up with me for the last few years . a little more would do it . and we need the dibs , my dear . i shall be a very rich man when the old fellow pops off . he ’ s mean as they make ’ em , but he ’ s rolling in money really . i don ’ t want him to go altering his will . you leave it to me , and don ’ t worry. ’ those were his exact words . i remember them perfectly . unfortunately , just then i stepped on a dry twig or something , and they lowered their voices and moved away . i couldn ’ t , of course , go rushing after them , so wasn ’ t able to see who the girl was . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ that must have been most vexing , ” i said . “ i suppose , though , you hurried on to the three boars , felt faint , and went into the bar for a glass of brandy , and so were able to see if both the barmaids were on duty ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ it wasn ’ t a barmaid , ” said caroline unhesitatingly . “ in fact , i ’ m almost sure that it was flora ackroyd , only—— ” “ only it doesn ’ t seem to make sense , ” i agreed . “ but if it wasn ’ t flora , who could it have been ? ”
christie	ackroyd	rapidly my sister ran over a list of maidens living in the neighborhood , with profuse reasons for and against . when she paused for breath , i murmured something about a patient , and slipped out .
christie	ackroyd	i proposed to make my way to the three boars . it seemed likely that ralph paton would have returned there by now . i knew ralph very well—better , perhaps , than any one else in king ’ s abbot , for i had known his mother before him , and therefore i understood much in him that puzzled others . he was , to a certain extent , the victim of heredity . he had not inherited his mother ’ s fatal propensity for drink , but nevertheless he had in him a strain of weakness . as my new friend of this morning had declared , he was extraordinarily handsome . just on six feet , perfectly proportioned , with the easy grace of an athlete , he was dark , like his mother , with a handsome , sunburnt face always ready to break into a smile . ralph paton was of those born to charm easily and without effort . he was self-indulgent and extravagant , with no veneration for anything on earth , but he was lovable nevertheless , and his friends were all devoted to him .
christie	ackroyd	could i do anything with the boy ? i thought i could . on inquiry at the three boars i found that captain paton had just come in . i went up to his room and entered unannounced .
christie	ackroyd	for a moment , remembering what i had heard and seen , i was doubtful of my reception , but i need have had no misgivings . “ why , it ’ s sheppard ! glad to see you . ”
christie	ackroyd	he came forward to meet me , hand outstretched , a sunny smile lighting up his face . “ the one person i am glad to see in this infernal place. ” i raised my eyebrows .
christie	ackroyd	“ what ’ s the place been doing ? ” he gave a vexed laugh . “ it ’ s a long story . things haven ’ t been going well with me , doctor . but have a drink , won ’ t you ? ” “ thanks , ” i said , “ i will . ”
christie	ackroyd	he pressed the bell , then , coming back , threw himself into a chair . “ not to mince matters , ” he said gloomily , “ i ’ m in the devil of a mess . in fact , i haven ’ t the least idea what to do next . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ what ’ s the matter ? ” i asked sympathetically . “ it ’ s my confounded stepfather. ” “ what has he done ? ” “ it isn ’ t what he ’ s done yet , but what he ’ s likely to do. ” the bell was answered , and ralph ordered the drinks . when the man had gone again , he sat hunched in the arm-chair , frowning to himself .
christie	ackroyd	“ is it really—serious ? ” i asked . he nodded . “ i ’ m fairly up against it this time , ” he said soberly . the unusual ring of gravity in his voice told me that he spoke the truth . it took a good deal to make ralph grave .
christie	ackroyd	“ in fact , ” he continued , “ i can ’ t see my way ahead .... i ’ m damned if i can. ” “ if i could help—— ” i suggested diffidently . but he shook his head very decidedly . “ good of you , doctor . but i can ’ t let you in on this . i ’ ve got to play a lone hand . ”
christie	ackroyd	he was silent a minute and then repeated in a slightly different tone of voice : — “ yes—i ’ ve got to play a lone hand .... ” chapter iv dinner at fernly it was just a few minutes before half-past seven when i rang the front door bell of fernly park . the door was opened with admirable promptitude by parker , the butler .
christie	ackroyd	the night was such a fine one that i had preferred to come on foot . i stepped into the big square hall and parker relieved me of my overcoat . just then ackroyd ’ s secretary , a pleasant young fellow by the name of raymond , passed through the hall on his way to ackroyd ’ s study , his hands full of papers .
christie	ackroyd	“ good-evening , doctor . coming to dine ? or is this a professional call ? ” the last was in allusion to my black bag , which i had laid down on the oak chest . i explained that i expected a summons to a confinement case at any moment , and so had come out prepared for an emergency call . raymond nodded , and went on his way , calling over his shoulder : —
christie	ackroyd	“ go into the drawing-room . you know the way . the ladies will be down in a minute . i must just take these papers to mr. ackroyd , and i ’ ll tell him you ’ re here . ”
christie	ackroyd	on raymond ’ s appearance parker had withdrawn , so i was alone in the hall . i settled my tie , glanced in a large mirror which hung there , and crossed to the door directly facing me , which was , as i knew , the door of the drawing-room .
christie	ackroyd	i noticed , just as i was turning the handle , a sound from within—the shutting down of a window , i took it to be . i noted it , i may say , quite mechanically , without attaching any importance to it at the time .
christie	ackroyd	i opened the door and walked in . as i did so , i almost collided with miss russell , who was just coming out . we both apologized . for the first time i found myself appraising the housekeeper and thinking what a handsome woman she must once have been—indeed , as far as that goes , still was . her dark hair was unstreaked with gray , and when she had a color , as she had at this minute , the stern quality of her looks was not so apparent .
christie	ackroyd	quite subconsciously i wondered whether she had been out , for she was breathing hard , as though she had been running . “ i ’ m afraid i ’ m a few minutes early , ” i said . “ oh ! i don ’ t think so . it ’ s gone half-past seven , dr. sheppard. ” she paused a minute before saying , “ i—didn ’ t know you were expected to dinner to-night . mr. ackroyd didn ’ t mention it . ”
christie	ackroyd	i received a vague impression that my dining there displeased her in some way , but i couldn ’ t imagine why . “ how ’ s the knee ? ” i inquired . “ much the same , thank you , doctor . i must be going now . mrs. ackroyd will be down in a moment . i—i only came in here to see if the flowers were all right . ”
christie	ackroyd	she passed quickly out of the room . i strolled to the window , wondering at her evident desire to justify her presence in the room . as i did so , i saw what , of course , i might have known all the time had i troubled to give my mind to it , namely , that the windows were long french ones opening on the terrace . the sound i had heard , therefore , could not have been that of a window being shut down .
christie	ackroyd	quite idly , and more to distract my mind from painful thoughts than for any other reason , i amused myself by trying to guess what could have caused the sound in question .
christie	ackroyd	coals on the fire ? no , that was not the kind of noise at all . a drawer of the bureau pushed in ? no , not that . then my eye was caught by what , i believe , is called a silver table , the lid of which lifts , and through the glass of which you can see the contents . i crossed over to it , studying the things . there were one or two pieces of old silver , a baby shoe belonging to king charles the first , some chinese jade figures , and quite a number of african implements and curios . wanting to examine one of the jade figures more closely , i lifted the lid . it slipped through my fingers and fell .
christie	ackroyd	at once i recognized the sound i had heard . it was this same table lid being shut down gently and carefully . i repeated the action once or twice for my own satisfaction . then i lifted the lid to scrutinize the contents more closely .
christie	ackroyd	i was still bending over the open silver table when flora ackroyd came into the room . quite a lot of people do not like flora ackroyd , but nobody can help admiring her . and to her friends she can be very charming . the first thing that strikes you about her is her extraordinary fairness . she has the real scandinavian pale gold hair . her eyes are blue—blue as the waters of a norwegian fiord , and her skin is cream and roses . she has square , boyish shoulders and slight hips . and to a jaded medical man it is very refreshing to come across such perfect health .
christie	ackroyd	a simple straight-forward english girl—i may be old-fashioned , but i think the genuine article takes a lot of beating . flora joined me by the silver table , and expressed heretical doubts as to king charles i ever having worn the baby shoe .
christie	ackroyd	“ and anyway , ” continued miss flora , “ all this making a fuss about things because some one wore or used them seems to me all nonsense . they ’ re not wearing or using them now . the pen that george eliot wrote _the mill on the floss_ with—that sort of thing—well , it ’ s only just a pen after all . if you ’ re really keen on george eliot , why not get _the mill on the floss_ in a cheap edition and read it . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i suppose you never read such old out-of-date stuff , miss flora ? ” “ you ’ re wrong , dr. sheppard . i love _the mill on the floss_. ” i was rather pleased to hear it . the things young women read nowadays and profess to enjoy positively frighten me .
christie	ackroyd	“ you haven ’ t congratulated me yet , dr. sheppard , ” said flora . “ haven ’ t you heard ? ” she held out her left hand . on the third finger of it was an exquisitely set single pearl .
christie	ackroyd	“ i ’ m going to marry ralph , you know , ” she went on . “ uncle is very pleased . it keeps me in the family , you see. ” i took both her hands in mine . “ my dear , ” i said , “ i hope you ’ ll be very happy . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ we ’ ve been engaged for about a month , ” continued flora in her cool voice , “ but it was only announced yesterday . uncle is going to do up cross-stones , and give it to us to live in , and we ’ re going to pretend to farm . really , we shall hunt all the winter , town for the season , and then go yachting . i love the sea . and , of course , i shall take a great interest in the parish affairs , and attend all the mothers ’ meetings . ”
christie	ackroyd	just then mrs. ackroyd rustled in , full of apologies for being late . i am sorry to say i detest mrs. ackroyd . she is all chains and teeth and bones . a most unpleasant woman . she has small pale flinty blue eyes , and however gushing her words may be , those eyes of hers always remain coldly speculative .
christie	ackroyd	i went across to her , leaving flora by the window . she gave me a handful of assorted knuckles and rings to squeeze , and began talking volubly . had i heard about flora ’ s engagement ? so suitable in every way . the dear young things had fallen in love at first sight . such a perfect pair , he so dark and she so fair .
christie	ackroyd	“ i can ’ t tell you , my dear dr. sheppard , the relief to a mother ’ s heart. ” mrs. ackroyd sighed—a tribute to her mother ’ s heart , whilst her eyes remained shrewdly observant of me .
christie	ackroyd	“ i was wondering . you are such an old friend of dear roger ’ s . we know how much he trusts to your judgment . so difficult for me—in my position , as poor cecil ’ s widow . but there are so many tiresome things—settlements , you know—all that . i fully believe that roger intends to make settlements upon dear flora , but , as you know , he is just a _leetle_ peculiar about money . very usual , i ’ ve heard , amongst men who are captains of industry . i wondered , you know , if you could just _sound_ him on the subject ? flora is so fond of you . we feel you are quite an old friend , although we have only really known you just over two years . ”
christie	ackroyd	mrs. ackroyd ’ s eloquence was cut short as the drawing-room door opened once more . i was pleased at the interruption . i hate interfering in other people ’ s affairs , and i had not the least intention of tackling ackroyd on the subject of flora ’ s settlements . in another moment i should have been forced to tell mrs. ackroyd as much .
christie	ackroyd	“ you know major blunt , don ’ t you , doctor ? ” “ yes , indeed , ” i said . a lot of people know hector blunt—at least by repute . he has shot more wild animals in unlikely places than any man living , i suppose . when you mention him , people say : “ blunt—you don ’ t mean the big game man , do you ? ”
christie	ackroyd	his friendship with ackroyd has always puzzled me a little . the two men are so totally dissimilar . hector blunt is perhaps five years ackroyd ’ s junior . they made friends early in life , and though their ways have diverged , the friendship still holds . about once in two years blunt spends a fortnight at fernly , and an immense animal ’ s head , with an amazing number of horns which fixes you with a glazed stare as soon as you come inside the front door , is a permanent reminder of the friendship .
christie	ackroyd	blunt had entered the room now with his own peculiar , deliberate , yet soft-footed tread . he is a man of medium height , sturdily and rather stockily built . his face is almost mahogany-colored , and is peculiarly expressionless . he has gray eyes that give the impression of always watching something that is happening very far away . he talks little , and what he does say is said jerkily , as though the words were forced out of him unwillingly .
christie	ackroyd	he said now : “ how are you , sheppard ? ” in his usual abrupt fashion , and then stood squarely in front of the fireplace looking over our heads as though he saw something very interesting happening in timbuctoo .
christie	ackroyd	“ major blunt , ” said flora , “ i wish you ’ d tell me about these african things . i ’ m sure you know what they all are. ” i have heard hector blunt described as a woman hater , but i noticed that he joined flora at the silver table with what might be described as alacrity . they bent over it together .
christie	ackroyd	i was afraid mrs. ackroyd would begin talking about settlements again , so i made a few hurried remarks about the new sweet pea . i knew there was a new sweet pea because the _daily mail_ had told me so that morning . mrs. ackroyd knows nothing about horticulture , but she is the kind of woman who likes to appear well-informed about the topics of the day , and she , too , reads the _daily mail_ . we were able to converse quite intelligently until ackroyd and his secretary joined us , and immediately afterwards parker announced dinner .
christie	ackroyd	my place at table was between mrs. ackroyd and flora . blunt was on mrs. ackroyd ’ s other side , and geoffrey raymond next to him . dinner was not a cheerful affair . ackroyd was visibly preoccupied . he looked wretched , and ate next to nothing . mrs. ackroyd , raymond , and i kept the conversation going . flora seemed affected by her uncle ’ s depression , and blunt relapsed into his usual taciturnity .
christie	ackroyd	immediately after dinner ackroyd slipped his arm through mine and led me off to his study . “ once we ’ ve had coffee , we shan ’ t be disturbed again , ” he explained . “ i told raymond to see to it that we shouldn ’ t be interrupted . ”
christie	ackroyd	i studied him quietly without appearing to do so . he was clearly under the influence of some strong excitement . for a minute or two he paced up and down the room , then , as parker entered with the coffee tray , he sank into an arm-chair in front of the fire .
christie	ackroyd	the study was a comfortable apartment . book-shelves lined one wall of it . the chairs were big and covered in dark blue leather . a large desk stood by the window and was covered with papers neatly docketed and filed . on a round table were various magazines and sporting papers .
christie	ackroyd	“ i ’ ve had a return of that pain after food lately , ” remarked ackroyd casually , as he helped himself to coffee . “ you must give me some more of those tablets of yours . ”
christie	ackroyd	it struck me that he was anxious to convey the impression that our conference was a medical one . i played up accordingly . “ i thought as much . i brought some up with me . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ good man . hand them over now. ” “ they ’ re in my bag in the hall . i ’ ll get them. ” ackroyd arrested me . “ don ’ t you trouble . parker will get them . bring in the doctor ’ s bag , will you , parker ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ very good , sir. ” parker withdrew . as i was about to speak , ackroyd threw up his hand . “ not yet . wait . don ’ t you see i ’ m in such a state of nerves that i can hardly contain myself ? ”
christie	ackroyd	i saw that plainly enough . and i was very uneasy . all sorts of forebodings assailed me . ackroyd spoke again almost immediately . “ make certain that window ’ s closed , will you ? ” he asked .
christie	ackroyd	somewhat surprised , i got up and went to it . it was not a french window , but one of the ordinary sash type . the heavy blue velvet curtains were drawn in front of it , but the window itself was open at the top .
christie	ackroyd	parker reëntered the room with my bag while i was still at the window . “ that ’ s all right , ” i said , emerging again into the room . “ you ’ ve put the latch across ? ” “ yes , yes . what ’ s the matter with you , ackroyd ? ”
christie	ackroyd	the door had just closed behind parker , or i would not have put the question . ackroyd waited just a minute before replying . “ i ’ m in hell , ” he said slowly , after a minute . “ no , don ’ t bother with those damned tablets . i only said that for parker . servants are so curious . come here and sit down . the door ’ s closed too , isn ’ t it ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ yes . nobody can overhear ; don ’ t be uneasy. ” “ sheppard , nobody knows what i ’ ve gone through in the last twenty-four hours . if a man ’ s house ever fell in ruins about him , mine has about me . this business of ralph ’ s is the last straw . but we won ’ t talk about that now . it ’ s the other—the other—— ! i don ’ t know what to do about it . and i ’ ve got to make up my mind soon . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ what ’ s the trouble ? ” ackroyd remained silent for a minute or two . he seemed curiously averse to begin . when he did speak , the question he asked came as a complete surprise . it was the last thing i expected .
christie	ackroyd	“ sheppard , you attended ashley ferrars in his last illness , didn ’ t you ? ” “ yes , i did. ” he seemed to find even greater difficulty in framing his next question . “ did you never suspect—did it ever enter your head—that—well , that he might have been poisoned ? ”
christie	ackroyd	i was silent for a minute or two . then i made up my mind what to say . roger ackroyd was not caroline . “ i ’ ll tell you the truth , ” i said . “ at the time i had no suspicion whatever , but since—well , it was mere idle talk on my sister ’ s part that first put the idea into my head . since then i haven ’ t been able to get it out again . but , mind you , i ’ ve no foundation whatever for that suspicion . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ he _was_ poisoned , ” said ackroyd . he spoke in a dull heavy voice . “ who by ? ” i asked sharply . “ his wife. ” “ how do you know that ? ” “ she told me so herself. ” “ when ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ yesterday ! my god ! yesterday ! it seems ten years ago. ” i waited a minute , and then he went on . “ you understand , sheppard , i ’ m telling you this in confidence . it ’ s to go no further . i want your advice—i can ’ t carry the whole weight by myself . as i said just now , i don ’ t know what to do . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ can you tell me the whole story ? ” i said . “ i ’ m still in the dark . how did mrs. ferrars come to make this confession to you ? ” “ it ’ s like this . three months ago i asked mrs. ferrars to marry me . she refused . i asked her again and she consented , but she refused to allow me to make the engagement public until her year of mourning was up . yesterday i called upon her , pointed out that a year and three weeks had now elapsed since her husband ’ s death , and that there could be no further objection to making the engagement public property . i had noticed that she had been very strange in her manner for some days . now , suddenly , without the least warning , she broke down completely . she—she told me everything . her hatred of her brute of a husband , her growing love for me , and the—the dreadful means she had taken . poison ! my god ! it was murder in cold blood . ”
christie	ackroyd	i saw the repulsion , the horror , in ackroyd ’ s face . so mrs. ferrars must have seen it . ackroyd is not the type of the great lover who can forgive all for love ’ s sake . he is fundamentally a good citizen . all that was sound and wholesome and law-abiding in him must have turned from her utterly in that moment of revelation .
christie	ackroyd	“ yes , ” he went on , in a low , monotonous voice , “ she confessed everything . it seems that there is one person who has known all along—who has been blackmailing her for huge sums . it was the strain of that that drove her nearly mad . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ who was the man ? ” suddenly before my eyes there arose the picture of ralph paton and mrs. ferrars side by side . their heads so close together . i felt a momentary throb of anxiety . supposing—oh ! but surely that was impossible . i remembered the frankness of ralph ’ s greeting that very afternoon . absurd !
christie	ackroyd	“ she wouldn ’ t tell me his name , ” said ackroyd slowly . “ as a matter of fact , she didn ’ t actually say that it was a man . but of course—— ” “ of course , ” i agreed . “ it must have been a man . and you ’ ve no suspicion at all ? ”
christie	ackroyd	for answer ackroyd groaned and dropped his head into his hands . “ it can ’ t be , ” he said . “ i ’ m mad even to think of such a thing . no , i won ’ t even admit to you the wild suspicion that crossed my mind . i ’ ll tell you this much , though . something she said made me think that the person in question might be actually among my household—but that can ’ t be so . i must have misunderstood her . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ what did you say to her ? ” i asked . “ what could i say ? she saw , of course , the awful shock it had been to me . and then there was the question , what was my duty in the matter ? she had made me , you see , an accessory after the fact . she saw all that , i think , quicker than i did . i was stunned , you know . she asked me for twenty-four hours—made me promise to do nothing till the end of that time . and she steadfastly refused to give me the name of the scoundrel who had been blackmailing her . i suppose she was afraid that i might go straight off and hammer him , and then the fat would have been in the fire as far as she was concerned . she told me that i should hear from her before twenty-four hours had passed . my god ! i swear to you , sheppard , that it never entered my head what she meant to do . suicide ! and i drove her to it . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ no , no , ” i said . “ don ’ t take an exaggerated view of things . the responsibility for her death doesn ’ t lie at your door. ” “ the question is , what am i to do now ? the poor lady is dead . why rake up past trouble ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i rather agree with you , ” i said . “ but there ’ s another point . how am i to get hold of that scoundrel who drove her to death as surely as if he ’ d killed her . he knew of the first crime , and he fastened on to it like some obscene vulture . she ’ s paid the penalty . is he to go scot-free ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i see , ” i said slowly . “ you want to hunt him down ? it will mean a lot of publicity , you know. ” “ yes , i ’ ve thought of that . i ’ ve zigzagged to and fro in my mind . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i agree with you that the villain ought to be punished , but the cost has got to be reckoned. ” ackroyd rose and walked up and down . presently he sank into the chair again .
christie	ackroyd	“ look here , sheppard , suppose we leave it like this . if no word comes from her , we ’ ll let the dead things lie. ” “ what do you mean by word coming from her ? ” i asked curiously .
christie	ackroyd	“ i have the strongest impression that somewhere or somehow she must have left a message for me—before she went . i can ’ t argue about it , but there it is. ” i shook my head .
christie	ackroyd	“ she left no letter or word of any kind . i asked. ” “ sheppard , i ’ m convinced that she did . and more , i ’ ve a feeling that by deliberately choosing death , she wanted the whole thing to come out , if only to be revenged on the man who drove her to desperation . i believe that if i could have seen her then , she would have told me his name and bid me go for him for all i was worth . ”
christie	ackroyd	he looked at me . “ you don ’ t believe in impressions ? ” “ oh , yes , i do , in a sense . if , as you put it , word should come from her—— ” i broke off . the door opened noiselessly and parker entered with a salver on which were some letters .
christie	ackroyd	“ the evening post , sir , ” he said , handing the salver to ackroyd . then he collected the coffee cups and withdrew . my attention , diverted for a moment , came back to ackroyd . he was staring like a man turned to stone at a long blue envelope . the other letters he had let drop to the ground .
christie	ackroyd	“ _her writing_ , ” he said in a whisper . “ she must have gone out and posted it last night , just before—before—— ” he ripped open the envelope and drew out a thick enclosure . then he looked up sharply .
christie	ackroyd	“ you ’ re sure you shut the window ? ” he said . “ quite sure , ” i said , surprised . “ why ? ” “ all this evening i ’ ve had a queer feeling of being watched , spied upon . what ’ s that—— ? ” he turned sharply . so did i . we both had the impression of hearing the latch of the door give ever so slightly . i went across to it and opened it . there was no one there .
christie	ackroyd	“ nerves , ” murmured ackroyd to himself . he unfolded the thick sheets of paper , and read aloud in a low voice . “ _my dear , my very dear roger , —a life calls for a life . i see that—i saw it in your face this afternoon . so i am taking the only road open to me . i leave to you the punishment of the person who has made my life a hell upon earth for the last year . i would not tell you the name this afternoon , but i propose to write it to you now . i have no children or near relations to be spared , so do not fear publicity . if you can , roger , my very dear roger , forgive me the wrong i meant to do you , since when the time came , i could not do it after all .... _ ”
christie	ackroyd	ackroyd , his finger on the sheet to turn it over , paused . “ sheppard , forgive me , but i must read this alone , ” he said unsteadily . “ it was meant for my eyes , and my eyes only . ”
christie	ackroyd	he put the letter in the envelope and laid it on the table . “ later , when i am alone. ” “ no , ” i cried impulsively , “ read it now. ” ackroyd stared at me in some surprise .
christie	ackroyd	“ i beg your pardon , ” i said , reddening . “ i do not mean read it aloud to me . but read it through whilst i am still here. ” ackroyd shook his head . “ no , i ’ d rather wait . ”
christie	ackroyd	but for some reason , obscure to myself , i continued to urge him . “ at least , read the name of the man , ” i said . now ackroyd is essentially pig-headed . the more you urge him to do a thing , the more determined he is not to do it . all my arguments were in vain .
christie	ackroyd	the letter had been brought in at twenty minutes to nine . it was just on ten minutes to nine when i left him , the letter still unread . i hesitated with my hand on the door handle , looking back and wondering if there was anything i had left undone . i could think of nothing . with a shake of the head i passed out and closed the door behind me .
christie	ackroyd	i was startled by seeing the figure of parker close at hand . he looked embarrassed , and it occurred to me that he might have been listening at the door . what a fat , smug , oily face the man had , and surely there was something decidedly shifty in his eye .
christie	ackroyd	“ mr . ackroyd particularly does not want to be disturbed , ” i said coldly . “ he told me to tell you so. ” “ quite so , sir . i—i fancied i heard the bell ring. ” this was such a palpable untruth that i did not trouble to reply . preceding me to the hall , parker helped me on with my overcoat , and i stepped out into the night . the moon was overcast and everything seemed very dark and still . the village church clock chimed nine o ’ clock as i passed through the lodge gates . i turned to the left towards the village , and almost cannoned into a man coming in the opposite direction .
christie	ackroyd	“ this the way to fernly park , mister ? ” asked the stranger in a hoarse voice . i looked at him . he was wearing a hat pulled down over his eyes , and his coat collar turned up . i could see little or nothing of his face , but he seemed a young fellow . the voice was rough and uneducated .
christie	ackroyd	“ these are the lodge gates here , ” i said . “ thank you , mister. ” he paused , and then added , quite unnecessarily , “ i ’ m a stranger in these parts , you see. ” he went on , passing through the gates as i turned to look after him .
christie	ackroyd	the odd thing was that his voice reminded me of some one ’ s voice that i knew , but whose it was i could not think . ten minutes later i was at home once more . caroline was full of curiosity to know why i had returned so early . i had to make up a slightly fictitious account of the evening in order to satisfy her , and i had an uneasy feeling that she saw through the transparent device .
christie	ackroyd	at ten o ’ clock i rose , yawned , and suggested bed . caroline acquiesced . it was friday night , and on friday night i wind the clocks . i did it as usual , whilst caroline satisfied herself that the servants had locked up the kitchen properly .
christie	ackroyd	it was a quarter past ten as we went up the stairs . i had just reached the top when the telephone rang in the hall below . “ mrs . bates , ” said caroline immediately .
christie	ackroyd	“ i ’ m afraid so , ” i said ruefully . i ran down the stairs and took up the receiver . “ what ? ” i said . “ _what ? _ certainly , i ’ ll come at once. ” i ran upstairs , caught up my bag , and stuffed a few extra dressings into it .
christie	ackroyd	“ parker telephoning , ” i shouted to caroline , “ from fernly . they ’ ve just found roger ackroyd murdered. ” chapter v murder i got out the car in next to no time , and drove rapidly to fernly . jumping out , i pulled the bell impatiently . there was some delay in answering , and i rang again .
christie	ackroyd	then i heard the rattle of the chain and parker , his impassivity of countenance quite unmoved , stood in the open doorway . i pushed past him into the hall . “ where is he ? ” i demanded sharply .
christie	ackroyd	“ i beg your pardon , sir ? ” “ your master . mr. ackroyd . don ’ t stand there staring at me , man . have you notified the police ? ” “ the police , sir ? did you say the police ? ” parker stared at me as though i were a ghost .
christie	ackroyd	“ what ’ s the matter with you , parker ? if , as you say , your master has been murdered—— ” a gasp broke from parker . “ the master ? murdered ? impossible , sir ! ” it was my turn to stare .
christie	ackroyd	“ didn ’ t you telephone to me , not five minutes ago , and tell me that mr. ackroyd had been found murdered ? ” “ me , sir ? oh ! no indeed , sir . i wouldn ’ t dream of doing such a thing . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ do you mean to say it ’ s all a hoax ? that there ’ s nothing the matter with mr. ackroyd ? ” “ excuse me , sir , did the person telephoning use my name ? ” “ i ’ ll give you the exact words i heard . ‘ _is that dr. sheppard ? parker , the butler at fernly , speaking . will you please come at once , sir . mr. ackroyd has been murdered._ ’ ”
christie	ackroyd	parker and i stared at each other blankly . “ a very wicked joke to play , sir , ” he said at last , in a shocked tone . “ fancy saying a thing like that. ” “ where is mr. ackroyd ? ” i asked suddenly .
christie	ackroyd	“ still in the study , i fancy , sir . the ladies have gone to bed , and major blunt and mr. raymond are in the billiard room. ” “ i think i ’ ll just look in and see him for a minute , ” i said . “ i know he didn ’ t want to be disturbed again , but this odd practical joke has made me uneasy . i ’ d just like to satisfy myself that he ’ s all right . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ quite so , sir . it makes me feel quite uneasy myself . if you don ’ t object to my accompanying you as far as the door , sir—— ? ” “ not at all , ” i said . “ come along . ”
christie	ackroyd	i passed through the door on the right , parker on my heels , traversed the little lobby where a small flight of stairs led upstairs to ackroyd ’ s bedroom , and tapped on the study door .
christie	ackroyd	there was no answer . i turned the handle , but the door was locked . “ allow me , sir , ” said parker . very nimbly , for a man of his build , he dropped on one knee and applied his eye to the keyhole .
christie	ackroyd	“ key is in the lock all right , sir , ” he said , rising . “ on the inside . mr. ackroyd must have locked himself in and possibly just dropped off to sleep. ” i bent down and verified parker ’ s statement .
christie	ackroyd	“ it seems all right , ” i said , “ but , all the same , parker , i ’ m going to wake your master up . i shouldn ’ t be satisfied to go home without hearing from his own lips that he ’ s quite all right . ”
christie	ackroyd	so saying , i rattled the handle and called out , “ ackroyd , ackroyd , just a minute. ” but still there was no answer . i glanced over my shoulder . “ i don ’ t want to alarm the household , ” i said hesitatingly .
christie	ackroyd	parker went across and shut the door from the big hall through which we had come . “ i think that will be all right now , sir . the billiard room is at the other side of the house , and so are the kitchen quarters and the ladies ’ bedrooms . ”
christie	ackroyd	i nodded comprehendingly . then i banged once more frantically on the door , and stooping down , fairly bawled through the keyhole : — “ ackroyd , ackroyd ! it ’ s sheppard . let me in. ” and still—silence . not a sign of life from within the locked room . parker and i glanced at each other .
christie	ackroyd	“ look here , parker , ” i said , “ i ’ m going to break this door in—or rather , we are . i ’ ll take the responsibility. ” “ if you say so , sir , ” said parker , rather doubtfully . “ i do say so . i ’ m seriously alarmed about mr. ackroyd . ”
christie	ackroyd	i looked round the small lobby and picked up a heavy oak chair . parker and i held it between us and advanced to the assault . once , twice , and three times we hurled it against the lock . at the third blow it gave , and we staggered into the room .
christie	ackroyd	ackroyd was sitting as i had left him in the arm-chair before the fire . his head had fallen sideways , and clearly visible , just below the collar of his coat , was a shining piece of twisted metalwork .
christie	ackroyd	parker and i advanced till we stood over the recumbent figure . i heard the butler draw in his breath with a sharp hiss . “ stabbed from be ’ ind , ” he murmured . “ ’ orrible ! ” he wiped his moist brow with his handkerchief , then stretched out a hand gingerly towards the hilt of the dagger .
christie	ackroyd	“ you mustn ’ t touch that , ” i said sharply . “ go at once to the telephone and ring up the police station . inform them of what has happened . then tell mr. raymond and major blunt . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ very good , sir. ” parker hurried away , still wiping his perspiring brow . i did what little had to be done . i was careful not to disturb the position of the body , and not to handle the dagger at all . no object was to be attained by moving it . ackroyd had clearly been dead some little time .
christie	ackroyd	then i heard young raymond ’ s voice , horror-stricken and incredulous , outside . “ what do you say ? oh ! impossible ! where ’ s the doctor ? ” he appeared impetuously in the doorway , then stopped dead , his face very white . a hand put him aside , and hector blunt came past him into the room .
christie	ackroyd	“ my god ! ” said raymond from behind him ; “ it ’ s true , then. ” blunt came straight on till he reached the chair . he bent over the body , and i thought that , like parker , he was going to lay hold of the dagger hilt . i drew him back with one hand .
christie	ackroyd	“ nothing must be moved , ” i explained . “ the police must see him exactly as he is now. ” blunt nodded in instant comprehension . his face was expressionless as ever , but i thought i detected signs of emotion beneath the stolid mask . geoffrey raymond had joined us now , and stood peering over blunt ’ s shoulder at the body .
christie	ackroyd	“ this is terrible , ” he said in a low voice . he had regained his composure , but as he took off the pince-nez he habitually wore and polished them i observed that his hand was shaking .
christie	ackroyd	“ robbery , i suppose , ” he said . “ how did the fellow get in ? through the window ? has anything been taken ? ” he went towards the desk . “ you think it ’ s burglary ? ” i said slowly .
christie	ackroyd	“ what else could it be ? there ’ s no question of suicide , i suppose ? ” “ no man could stab himself in such a way , ” i said confidently . “ it ’ s murder right enough . but with what motive ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ roger hadn ’ t an enemy in the world , ” said blunt quietly . “ must have been burglars . but what was the thief after ? nothing seems to be disarranged ? ” he looked round the room . raymond was still sorting the papers on the desk .
christie	ackroyd	“ there seems nothing missing , and none of the drawers show signs of having been tampered with , ” the secretary observed at last . “ it ’ s very mysterious. ” blunt made a slight motion with his head .
christie	ackroyd	“ there are some letters on the floor here , ” he said . i looked down . three or four letters still lay where ackroyd had dropped them earlier in the evening . but the blue envelope containing mrs. ferrars ’ s letter had disappeared . i half opened my mouth to speak , but at that moment the sound of a bell pealed through the house . there was a confused murmur of voices in the hall , and then parker appeared with our local inspector and a police constable .
christie	ackroyd	“ good evening , gentlemen , ” said the inspector . “ i ’ m terribly sorry for this ! a good kind gentleman like mr. ackroyd . the butler says it is murder . no possibility of accident or suicide , doctor ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ none whatever , ” i said . “ ah ! a bad business. ” he came and stood over the body . “ been moved at all ? ” he asked sharply . “ beyond making certain that life was extinct—an easy matter—i have not disturbed the body in any way . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ ah ! and everything points to the murderer having got clear away—for the moment , that is . now then , let me hear all about it . who found the body ? ” i explained the circumstances carefully .
christie	ackroyd	“ a telephone message , you say ? from the butler ? ” “ a message that i never sent , ” declared parker earnestly . “ i ’ ve not been near the telephone the whole evening . the others can bear me out that i haven ’ t . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ very odd , that . did it sound like parker ’ s voice , doctor ? ” “ well—i can ’ t say i noticed . i took it for granted , you see. ” “ naturally . well , you got up here , broke in the door , and found poor mr. ackroyd like this . how long should you say he had been dead , doctor ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ half an hour at least—perhaps longer , ” i said . “ the door was locked on the inside , you say ? what about the window ? ” “ i myself closed and bolted it earlier in the evening at mr. ackroyd ’ s request . ”
christie	ackroyd	the inspector strode across to it and threw back the curtains . “ well , it ’ s open now anyway , ” he remarked . true enough , the window was open , the lower sash being raised to its fullest extent .
christie	ackroyd	the inspector produced a pocket torch and flashed it along the sill outside . “ this is the way he went all right , ” he remarked , “ _and_ got in . see here. ” in the light of the powerful torch , several clearly defined footmarks could be seen . they seemed to be those of shoes with rubber studs in the soles . one particularly clear one pointed inwards , another , slightly overlapping it , pointed outwards .
christie	ackroyd	“ plain as a pikestaff , ” said the inspector . “ any valuables missing ? ” geoffrey raymond shook his head . “ not so that we can discover . mr. ackroyd never kept anything of particular value in this room . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ h ’ m , ” said the inspector . “ man found an open window . climbed in , saw mr. ackroyd sitting there—maybe he ’ d fallen asleep . man stabbed him from behind , then lost his nerve and made off . but he ’ s left his tracks pretty clearly . we ought to get hold of _him_ without much difficulty . no suspicious strangers been hanging about anywhere ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ oh ! ” i said suddenly . “ what is it , doctor ? ” “ i met a man this evening—just as i was turning out of the gate . he asked me the way to fernly park . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ what time would that be ? ” “ just nine o ’ clock . i heard it chime the hour as i was turning out of the gate. ” “ can you describe him ? ” i did so to the best of my ability .
christie	ackroyd	the inspector turned to the butler . “ any one answering that description come to the front door ? ” “ no , sir . no one has been to the house at all this evening. ” “ what about the back ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i don ’ t think so , sir , but i ’ ll make inquiries. ” he moved towards the door , but the inspector held up a large hand . “ no , thanks . i ’ ll do my own inquiring . but first of all i want to fix the time a little more clearly . when was mr. ackroyd last seen alive ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ probably by me , ” i said , “ when i left at—let me see—about ten minutes to nine . he told me that he didn ’ t wish to be disturbed , and i repeated the order to parker . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ just so , sir , ” said parker respectfully . “ mr . ackroyd was certainly alive at half-past nine , ” put in raymond , “ for i heard his voice in here talking. ” “ who was he talking to ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ that i don ’ t know . of course , at the time i took it for granted that it was dr. sheppard who was with him . i wanted to ask him a question about some papers i was engaged upon , but when i heard the voices i remembered that he had said he wanted to talk to dr. sheppard without being disturbed , and i went away again . but now it seems that the doctor had already left ? ”
christie	ackroyd	i nodded . “ i was at home by a quarter-past nine , ” i said . “ i didn ’ t go out again until i received the telephone call. ” “ who could have been with him at half-past nine ? ” queried the inspector . “ it wasn ’ t you , mr.—er—— ”
christie	ackroyd	“ major blunt , ” i said . “ major hector blunt ? ” asked the inspector , a respectful tone creeping into his voice . blunt merely jerked his head affirmatively . “ i think we ’ ve seen you down here before , sir , ” said the inspector . “ i didn ’ t recognize you for the moment , but you were staying with mr. ackroyd a year ago last may . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ june , ” corrected blunt . “ just so , june it was . now , as i was saying , it wasn ’ t you with mr. ackroyd at nine-thirty this evening ? ” blunt shook his head . “ never saw him after dinner , ” he volunteered .
christie	ackroyd	the inspector turned once more to raymond . “ you didn ’ t overhear any of the conversation going on , did you , sir ? ” “ i did catch just a fragment of it , ” said the secretary , “ and , supposing as i did that it was dr. sheppard who was with mr. ackroyd , that fragment struck me as distinctly odd . as far as i can remember , the exact words were these . mr. ackroyd was speaking . ‘ the calls on my purse have been so frequent of late ’ —that is what he was saying— ‘ of late , that i fear it is impossible for me to accede to your request .... ’ i went away again at once , of course , so did not hear any more . but i rather wondered because dr. sheppard—— ”
christie	ackroyd	“ ——does not ask for loans for himself or subscriptions for others , ” i finished . “ a demand for money , ” said the inspector musingly . “ it may be that here we have a very important clew. ” he turned to the butler . “ you say , parker , that nobody was admitted by the front door this evening ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ that ’ s what i say , sir. ” “ then it seems almost certain that mr. ackroyd himself must have admitted this stranger . but i don ’ t quite see—— ” the inspector went into a kind of day-dream for some minutes .
christie	ackroyd	“ one thing ’ s clear , ” he said at length , rousing himself from his absorption . “ mr . ackroyd was alive and well at nine-thirty . that is the last moment at which he is known to have been alive . ”
christie	ackroyd	parker gave vent to an apologetic cough which brought the inspector ’ s eyes on him at once . “ well ? ” he said sharply . “ if you ’ ll excuse me , sir , miss flora saw him after that . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ miss flora ? ” “ yes , sir . about a quarter to ten that would be . it was after that that she told me mr. ackroyd wasn ’ t to be disturbed again to-night. ” “ did he send her to you with that message ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ not exactly , sir . i was bringing a tray with soda and whisky when miss flora , who was just coming out of this room , stopped me and said her uncle didn ’ t want to be disturbed . ”
christie	ackroyd	the inspector looked at the butler with rather closer attention than he had bestowed on him up to now . “ you ’ d already been told that mr. ackroyd didn ’ t want to be disturbed , hadn ’ t you ? ”
christie	ackroyd	parker began to stammer . his hands shook . “ yes , sir . yes , sir . quite so , sir. ” “ and yet you were proposing to do so ? ” “ i ’ d forgotten , sir . at least i mean , i always bring the whisky and soda about that time , sir , and ask if there ’ s anything more , and i thought—well , i was doing as usual without thinking . ”
christie	ackroyd	it was at this moment that it began to dawn upon me that parker was most suspiciously flustered . the man was shaking and twitching all over . “ h ’ m , ” said the inspector . “ i must see miss ackroyd at once . for the moment we ’ ll leave this room exactly as it is . i can return here after i ’ ve heard what miss ackroyd has to tell me . i shall just take the precaution of shutting and bolting the window . ”
christie	ackroyd	this precaution accomplished , he led the way into the hall and we followed him . he paused a moment , as he glanced up at the little staircase , then spoke over his shoulder to the constable .
christie	ackroyd	“ jones , you ’ d better stay here . don ’ t let any one go into that room. ” parker interposed deferentially . “ if you ’ ll excuse me , sir . if you were to lock the door into the main hall , nobody could gain access to this part . that staircase leads only to mr. ackroyd ’ s bedroom and bathroom . there is no communication with the other part of the house . there once was a door through , but mr. ackroyd had it blocked up . he liked to feel that his suite was entirely private . ”
christie	ackroyd	to make things clear and explain the position , i have appended a rough sketch of the right-hand wing of the house . the small staircase leads , as parker explained , to a big bedroom ( made by two being knocked into one ) and an adjoining bathroom and lavatory .

christie	ackroyd	the inspector took in the position at a glance . we went through into the large hall and he locked the door behind him , slipping the key into his pocket . then he gave the constable some low-voiced instructions , and the latter prepared to depart .
christie	ackroyd	“ we must get busy on those shoe tracks , ” explained the inspector . “ but first of all , i must have a word with miss ackroyd . she was the last person to see her uncle alive . does she know yet ? ”
christie	ackroyd	raymond shook his head . “ well , no need to tell her for another five minutes . she can answer my questions better without being upset by knowing the truth about her uncle . tell her there ’ s been a burglary , and ask her if she would mind dressing and coming down to answer a few questions . ”
christie	ackroyd	it was raymond who went upstairs on this errand . “ miss ackroyd will be down in a minute , ” he said , when he returned . “ i told her just what you suggested. ” in less than five minutes flora descended the staircase . she was wrapped in a pale pink silk kimono . she looked anxious and excited .
christie	ackroyd	the inspector stepped forward . “ good-evening , miss ackroyd , ” he said civilly . “ we ’ re afraid there ’ s been an attempt at robbery , and we want you to help us . what ’ s this room—the billiard room ? come in here and sit down . ”
christie	ackroyd	flora sat down composedly on the wide divan which ran the length of the wall , and looked up at the inspector . “ i don ’ t quite understand . what has been stolen ? what do you want me to tell you ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ it ’ s just this , miss ackroyd . parker here says you came out of your uncle ’ s study at about a quarter to ten . is that right ? ” “ quite right . i had been to say good-night to him . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ and the time is correct ? ” “ well , it must have been about then . i can ’ t say exactly . it might have been later. ” “ was your uncle alone , or was there any one with him ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ he was alone . dr. sheppard had gone. ” “ did you happen to notice whether the window was open or shut ? ” flora shook her head . “ i can ’ t say . the curtains were drawn . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ exactly . and your uncle seemed quite as usual ? ” “ i think so. ” “ do you mind telling us exactly what passed between you ? ” flora paused a minute , as though to collect her recollections .
christie	ackroyd	“ i went in and said , ‘ good-night , uncle , i ’ m going to bed now . i ’ m tired to-night. ’ he gave a sort of grunt , and—i went over and kissed him , and he said something about my looking nice in the frock i had on , and then he told me to run away as he was busy . so i went . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ did he ask specially not to be disturbed ? ” “ oh ! yes , i forgot . he said : ‘ tell parker i don ’ t want anything more to-night , and that he ’ s not to disturb me. ’ i met parker just outside the door and gave him uncle ’ s message . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ just so , ” said the inspector . “ won ’ t you tell me what it is that has been stolen ? ” “ we ’ re not quite—certain , ” said the inspector hesitatingly . a wide look of alarm came into the girl ’ s eyes . she started up .
christie	ackroyd	“ what is it ? you ’ re hiding something from me ? ” moving in his usual unobtrusive manner , hector blunt came between her and the inspector . she half stretched out her hand , and he took it in both of his , patting it as though she were a very small child , and she turned to him as though something in his stolid , rocklike demeanor promised comfort and safety .
christie	ackroyd	“ it ’ s bad news , flora , ” he said quietly . “ bad news for all of us . your uncle roger—— ” “ yes ? ” “ it will be a shock to you . bound to be . poor roger ’ s dead . ”
christie	ackroyd	flora drew away from him , her eyes dilating with horror . “ when ? ” she whispered . “ when ? ” “ very soon after you left him , i ’ m afraid , ” said blunt gravely . flora raised her hand to her throat , gave a little cry , and i hurried to catch her as she fell . she had fainted , and blunt and i carried her upstairs and laid her on her bed . then i got him to wake mrs. ackroyd and tell her the news . flora soon revived , and i brought her mother to her , telling her what to do for the girl . then i hurried downstairs again .
christie	ackroyd	chapter vi the tunisian dagger i met the inspector just coming from the door which led into the kitchen quarters . “ how ’ s the young lady , doctor ? ” “ coming round nicely . her mother ’ s with her . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ that ’ s good . i ’ ve been questioning the servants . they all declare that no one has been to the back door to-night . your description of that stranger was rather vague . can ’ t you give us something more definite to go upon ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i ’ m afraid not , ” i said regretfully . “ it was a dark night , you see , and the fellow had his coat collar well pulled up and his hat squashed down over his eyes . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ h ’ m , ” said the inspector . “ looked as though he wanted to conceal his face . sure it was no one you know ? ” i replied in the negative , but not as decidedly as i might have done . i remembered my impression that the stranger ’ s voice was not unfamiliar to me . i explained this rather haltingly to the inspector .
christie	ackroyd	“ it was a rough , uneducated voice , you say ? ” i agreed , but it occurred to me that the roughness had been of an almost exaggerated quality . if , as the inspector thought , the man had wished to hide his face , he might equally well have tried to disguise his voice .
christie	ackroyd	“ do you mind coming into the study with me again , doctor ? there are one or two things i want to ask you. ” i acquiesced . inspector davis unlocked the door of the lobby , we passed through , and he locked the door again behind him .
christie	ackroyd	“ we don ’ t want to be disturbed , ” he said grimly . “ and we don ’ t want any eavesdropping either . what ’ s all this about blackmail ? ” “ blackmail ! ” i exclaimed , very much startled . “ is it an effort of parker ’ s imagination ? or is there something in it ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ if parker heard anything about blackmail , ” i said slowly , “ he must have been listening outside this door with his ear glued against the keyhole. ” davis nodded . “ nothing more likely . you see , i ’ ve been instituting a few inquiries as to what parker has been doing with himself this evening . to tell the truth , i didn ’ t like his manner . the man knows something . when i began to question him , he got the wind up , and plumped out some garbled story of blackmail . ”
christie	ackroyd	i took an instant decision . “ i ’ m rather glad you ’ ve brought the matter up , ” i said . “ i ’ ve been trying to decide whether to make a clean breast of things or not . i ’ d already practically decided to tell you everything , but i was going to wait for a favorable opportunity . you might as well have it now . ”
christie	ackroyd	and then and there i narrated the whole events of the evening as i have set them down here . the inspector listened keenly , occasionally interjecting a question . “ most extraordinary story i ever heard , ” he said , when i had finished . “ and you say that letter has completely disappeared ? it looks bad—it looks very bad indeed . it gives us what we ’ ve been looking for—a motive for the murder . ”
christie	ackroyd	i nodded . “ i realize that. ” “ you say that mr. ackroyd hinted at a suspicion he had that some member of his household was involved ? household ’ s rather an elastic term. ” “ you don ’ t think that parker himself might be the man we ’ re after ? ” i suggested .
christie	ackroyd	“ it looks very like it . he was obviously listening at the door when you came out . then miss ackroyd came across him later bent on entering the study . say he tried again when she was safely out of the way . he stabbed ackroyd , locked the door on the inside , opened the window , and got out that way , and went round to a side door which he had previously left open . how ’ s that ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ there ’ s only one thing against it , ” i said slowly . “ if ackroyd went on reading that letter as soon as i left , as he intended to do , i don ’ t see him continuing to sit on here and turn things over in his mind for another hour . he ’ d have had parker in at once , accused him then and there , and there would have been a fine old uproar . remember , ackroyd was a man of choleric temper . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ mightn ’ t have had time to go on with the letter just then , ” suggested the inspector . “ we know some one was with him at half-past nine . if that visitor turned up as soon as you left , and after he went , miss ackroyd came in to say good-night—well , he wouldn ’ t be able to go on with the letter until close upon ten o ’ clock . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ and the telephone call ? ” “ parker sent that all right—perhaps before he thought of the locked door and open window . then he changed his mind—or got in a panic—and decided to deny all knowledge of it . that was it , depend upon it . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ ye-es , ” i said rather doubtfully . “ anyway , we can find out the truth about the telephone call from the exchange . if it was put through from here , i don ’ t see how any one else but parker could have sent it . depend upon it , he ’ s our man . but keep it dark—we don ’ t want to alarm him just yet , till we ’ ve got all the evidence . i ’ ll see to it he doesn ’ t give us the slip . to all appearances we ’ ll be concentrating on your mysterious stranger . ”
christie	ackroyd	he rose from where he had been sitting astride the chair belonging to the desk , and crossed over to the still form in the arm-chair . “ the weapon ought to give us a clew , ” he remarked , looking up . “ it ’ s something quite unique—a curio , i should think , by the look of it . ”
christie	ackroyd	he bent down , surveying the handle attentively , and i heard him give a grunt of satisfaction . then , very gingerly , he pressed his hands down below the hilt and drew the blade out from the wound . still carrying it so as not to touch the handle , he placed it in a wide china mug which adorned the mantelpiece .
christie	ackroyd	“ yes , ” he said , nodding at it . “ quite a work of art . there can ’ t be many of them about. ” it was indeed a beautiful object . a narrow , tapering blade , and a hilt of elaborately intertwined metals of curious and careful workmanship . he touched the blade gingerly with his finger , testing its sharpness , and made an appreciative grimace .
christie	ackroyd	“ lord , what an edge , ” he exclaimed . “ a child could drive that into a man—as easy as cutting butter . a dangerous sort of toy to have about. ” “ may i examine the body properly now ? ” i asked .
christie	ackroyd	he nodded . “ go ahead. ” i made a thorough examination . “ well ? ” said the inspector , when i had finished . “ i ’ ll spare you the technical language , ” i said . “ we ’ ll keep that for the inquest . the blow was delivered by a right-handed man standing behind him , and death must have been instantaneous . by the expression on the dead man ’ s face , i should say that the blow was quite unexpected . he probably died without knowing who his assailant was . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ butlers can creep about as soft-footed as cats , ” said inspector davis . “ there ’ s not going to be much mystery about this crime . take a look at the hilt of that dagger . ”
christie	ackroyd	i took the look . “ i dare say they ’ re not apparent to you , but i can see them clearly enough. ” he lowered his voice . “ _fingerprints ! _ ” he stood off a few steps to judge of his effect .
christie	ackroyd	“ yes , ” i said mildly . “ i guessed that. ” i do not see why i should be supposed to be totally devoid of intelligence . after all , i read detective stories , and the newspapers , and am a man of quite average ability . if there had been toe marks on the dagger handle , now , that would have been quite a different thing . i would then have registered any amount of surprise and awe .
christie	ackroyd	i think the inspector was annoyed with me for declining to get thrilled . he picked up the china mug and invited me to accompany him to the billiard room . “ i want to see if mr. raymond can tell us anything about this dagger , ” he explained .
christie	ackroyd	locking the outer door behind us again , we made our way to the billiard room , where we found geoffrey raymond . the inspector held up his exhibit . “ ever seen this before , mr. raymond ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ why—i believe—i ’ m almost sure that is a curio given to mr. ackroyd by major blunt . it comes from morocco—no , tunis . so the crime was committed with that ? what an extraordinary thing . it seems almost impossible , and yet there could hardly be two daggers the same . may i fetch major blunt ? ”
christie	ackroyd	without waiting for an answer , he hurried off . “ nice young fellow that , ” said the inspector . “ something honest and ingenuous about him. ” i agreed . in the two years that geoffrey raymond has been secretary to ackroyd , i have never seen him ruffled or out of temper . and he has been , i know , a most efficient secretary .
christie	ackroyd	in a minute or two raymond returned , accompanied by blunt . “ i was right , ” said raymond excitedly . “ it _is_ the tunisian dagger. ” “ major blunt hasn ’ t looked at it yet , ” objected the inspector .
christie	ackroyd	“ saw it the moment i came into the study , ” said the quiet man . “ you recognized it then ? ” blunt nodded . “ you said nothing about it , ” said the inspector suspiciously . “ wrong moment , ” said blunt . “ lot of harm done by blurting out things at the wrong time . ”
christie	ackroyd	he returned the inspector ’ s stare placidly enough . the latter grunted at last and turned away . he brought the dagger over to blunt . “ you ’ re quite sure about it , sir . you identify it positively ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ absolutely . no doubt whatever. ” “ where was this—er—curio usually kept ? can you tell me that , sir ? ” it was the secretary who answered . “ in the silver table in the drawing-room. ” “ what ? ” i exclaimed .
christie	ackroyd	the others looked at me . “ yes , doctor ? ” said the inspector encouragingly . “ it ’ s nothing. ” “ yes , doctor ? ” said the inspector again , still more encouragingly . “ it ’ s so trivial , ” i explained apologetically . “ only that when i arrived last night for dinner i heard the lid of the silver table being shut down in the drawing-room . ”
christie	ackroyd	i saw profound skepticism and a trace of suspicion on the inspector ’ s countenance . “ how did you know it was the silver table lid ? ” i was forced to explain in detail—a long , tedious explanation which i would infinitely rather not have had to make .
christie	ackroyd	the inspector heard me to the end . “ was the dagger in its place when you were looking over the contents ? ” he asked . “ i don ’ t know , ” i said . “ i can ’ t say i remember noticing it—but , of course , it may have been there all the time . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ we ’ d better get hold of the housekeeper , ” remarked the inspector , and pulled the bell . a few minutes later miss russell , summoned by parker , entered the room . “ i don ’ t think i went near the silver table , ” she said , when the inspector had posed his question . “ i was looking to see that all the flowers were fresh . oh ! yes , i remember now . the silver table was open—which it had no business to be , and i shut the lid down as i passed . ”
christie	ackroyd	she looked at him aggressively . “ i see , ” said the inspector . “ can you tell me if this dagger was in its place then ? ” miss russell looked at the weapon composedly . “ i can ’ t say , i ’ m sure , ” she replied . “ i didn ’ t stop to look . i knew the family would be down any minute , and i wanted to get away . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ thank you , ” said the inspector . there was just a trace of hesitation in his manner , as though he would have liked to question her further , but miss russell clearly accepted the words as a dismissal , and glided from the room .
christie	ackroyd	“ rather a tartar , i should fancy , eh ? ” said the inspector , looking after her . “ let me see . this silver table is in front of one of the windows , i think you said , doctor ? ”
christie	ackroyd	raymond answered for me . “ yes , the left-hand window. ” “ and the window was open ? ” “ they were both ajar. ” “ well , i don ’ t think we need go into the question much further . somebody—i ’ ll just say somebody—could get that dagger any time he liked , and exactly when he got it doesn ’ t matter in the least . i ’ ll be coming up in the morning with the chief constable , mr. raymond . until then , i ’ ll keep the key of that door . i want colonel melrose to see everything exactly as it is . i happen to know that he ’ s dining out the other side of the county , and , i believe , staying the night .... ”
christie	ackroyd	we watched the inspector take up the jar . “ i shall have to pack this carefully , ” he observed . “ it ’ s going to be an important piece of evidence in more ways than one . ”
christie	ackroyd	a few minutes later as i came out of the billiard room with raymond , the latter gave a low chuckle of amusement . i felt the pressure of his hand on my arm , and followed the direction of his eyes . inspector davis seemed to be inviting parker ’ s opinion of a small pocket diary .
christie	ackroyd	“ a little obvious , ” murmured my companion . “ so parker is the suspect , is he ? shall we oblige inspector davis with a set of our fingerprints also ? ” he took two cards from the card tray , wiped them with his silk handkerchief , then handed one to me and took the other himself . then , with a grin , he handed them to the police inspector .
christie	ackroyd	“ souvenirs , ” he said . “ no . 1 , dr. sheppard ; no . 2 , my humble self . one from major blunt will be forthcoming in the morning. ” youth is very buoyant . even the brutal murder of his friend and employer could not dim geoffrey raymond ’ s spirits for long . perhaps that is as it should be . i do not know . i have lost the quality of resilience long since myself .
christie	ackroyd	it was very late when i got back , and i hoped that caroline would have gone to bed . i might have known better . she had hot cocoa waiting for me , and whilst i drank it , she extracted the whole history of the evening from me . i said nothing of the blackmailing business , but contented myself with giving her the facts of the murder .
christie	ackroyd	“ the police suspect parker , ” i said , as i rose to my feet and prepared to ascend to bed . “ there seems a fairly clear case against him. ” “ parker ! ” said my sister . “ fiddlesticks ! that inspector must be a perfect fool . parker indeed ! don ’ t tell me . ”
christie	ackroyd	with which obscure pronouncement we went up to bed . chapter vii i learn my neighbor ’ s profession on the following morning i hurried unforgivably over my round . my excuse can be that i had no very serious cases to attend . on my return caroline came into the hall to greet me .
christie	ackroyd	“ flora ackroyd is here , ” she announced in an excited whisper . “ what ? ” i concealed my surprise as best i could . “ she ’ s very anxious to see you . she ’ s been here half an hour . ”
christie	ackroyd	caroline led the way into our small sitting-room , and i followed . flora was sitting on the sofa by the window . she was in black and she sat nervously twisting her hands together . i was shocked by the sight of her face . all the color had faded away from it . but when she spoke her manner was as composed and resolute as possible .
christie	ackroyd	“ dr . sheppard , i have come to ask you to help me. ” “ of course he ’ ll help you , my dear , ” said caroline . i don ’ t think flora really wished caroline to be present at the interview . she would , i am sure , have infinitely preferred to speak to me privately . but she also wanted to waste no time , so she made the best of it .
christie	ackroyd	“ i want you to come to the larches with me. ” “ the larches ? ” i queried , surprised . “ to see that funny little man ? ” exclaimed caroline . “ yes . you know who he is , don ’ t you ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ we fancied , ” i said , “ that he might be a retired hairdresser. ” flora ’ s blue eyes opened very wide . “ why , he ’ s hercule poirot ! you know who i mean—the private detective . they say he ’ s done the most wonderful things—just like detectives do in books . a year ago he retired and came to live down here . uncle knew who he was , but he promised not to tell any one , because m. poirot wanted to live quietly without being bothered by people . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ so that ’ s who he is , ” i said slowly . “ you ’ ve heard of him , of course ? ” “ i ’ m rather an old fogey , as caroline tells me , ” i said , “ but i _have_ just heard of him . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ extraordinary ! ” commented caroline . i don ’ t know what she was referring to—possibly her own failure to discover the truth . “ you want to go and see him ? ” i asked slowly . “ now why ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ to get him to investigate this murder , of course , ” said caroline sharply . “ don ’ t be so stupid , james. ” i was not really being stupid . caroline does not always understand what i am driving at .
christie	ackroyd	“ you haven ’ t got confidence in inspector davis ? ” i went on . “ of course she hasn ’ t , ” said caroline . “ i haven ’ t either. ” any one would have thought it was caroline ’ s uncle who had been murdered .
christie	ackroyd	“ and how do you know he would take up the case ? ” i asked . “ remember he has retired from active work. ” “ that ’ s just it , ” said flora simply . “ i ’ ve got to persuade him . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ you are sure you are doing wisely ? ” i asked gravely . “ of course she is , ” said caroline . “ i ’ ll go with her myself if she likes. ” “ i ’ d rather the doctor came with me if you don ’ t mind , miss sheppard , ” said flora .
christie	ackroyd	she knows the value of being direct on certain occasions . any hints would certainly have been wasted on caroline . “ you see , ” she explained , following directness with tact , “ dr . sheppard being the doctor , and having found the body , he would be able to give all the details to m. poirot . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ yes , ” said caroline grudgingly , “ i see that. ” i took a turn or two up and down the room . “ flora , ” i said gravely , “ be guided by me . i advise you not to drag this detective into the case . ”
christie	ackroyd	flora sprang to her feet . the color rushed into her cheeks . “ i know why you say that , ” she cried . “ but it ’ s exactly for that reason i ’ m so anxious to go . you ’ re afraid ! but i ’ m not . i know ralph better than you do . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ ralph , ” said caroline . “ what has ralph got to do with it ? ” neither of us heeded her . “ ralph may be weak , ” continued flora . “ he may have done foolish things in the past—wicked things even—but he wouldn ’ t murder any one . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ no , no , ” i exclaimed . “ i never thought it of him. ” “ then why did you go to the three boars last night ? ” demanded flora , “ on your way home—after uncle ’ s body was found ? ”
christie	ackroyd	i was momentarily silenced . i had hoped that that visit of mine would remain unnoticed . “ how did you know about that ? ” i countered . “ i went there this morning , ” said flora . “ i heard from the servants that ralph was staying there—— ”
christie	ackroyd	i interrupted her . “ you had no idea that he was in king ’ s abbot ? ” “ no . i was astounded . i couldn ’ t understand it . i went there and asked for him . they told me , what i suppose they told you last night , that he went out at about nine o ’ clock yesterday evening—and—and never came back . ”
christie	ackroyd	her eyes met mine defiantly , and as though answering something in my look , she burst out : — “ well , why shouldn ’ t he ? he might have gone—anywhere . he may even have gone back to london . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ leaving his luggage behind ? ” i asked gently . flora stamped her foot . “ i don ’ t care . there must be a simple explanation. ” “ and that ’ s why you want to go to hercule poirot ? isn ’ t it better to leave things as they are ? the police don ’ t suspect ralph in the least , remember . they ’ re working on quite another tack . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ but that ’ s just _it_ , ” cried the girl . “ they _do_ suspect him . a man from cranchester turned up this morning—inspector raglan , a horrid , weaselly little man . i found he had been to the three boars this morning before me . they told me all about his having been there , and the questions he had asked . he must think ralph did it . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ that ’ s a change of mind from last night , if so , ” i said slowly . “ he doesn ’ t believe in davis ’ s theory that it was parker then ? ” “ parker indeed , ” said my sister , and snorted .
christie	ackroyd	flora came forward and laid her hand on my arm . “ oh ! dr. sheppard , let us go at once to this m. poirot . he will find out the truth. ” “ my dear flora , ” i said gently , laying my hand on hers . “ are you quite sure it is the truth we want ? ”
christie	ackroyd	she looked at me , nodding her head gravely . “ you ’ re not sure , ” she said . “ i am . i know ralph better than you do. ” “ of course he didn ’ t do it , ” said caroline , who had been keeping silent with great difficulty . “ ralph may be extravagant , but he ’ s a dear boy , and has the nicest manners . ”
christie	ackroyd	i wanted to tell caroline that large numbers of murderers have had nice manners , but the presence of flora restrained me . since the girl was determined , i was forced to give in to her and we started at once , getting away before my sister was able to fire off any more pronouncements beginning with her favorite words , “ of course . ”
christie	ackroyd	an old woman with an immense breton cap opened the door of the larches to us . m. poirot was at home , it seemed . we were ushered into a little sitting-room arranged with formal precision , and there , after the lapse of a minute or so , my friend of yesterday came to us .
christie	ackroyd	“ monsieur le docteur , ” he said , smiling . “ mademoiselle. ” he bowed to flora . “ perhaps , ” i began , “ you have heard of the tragedy which occurred last night. ” his face grew grave . “ but certainly i have heard . it is horrible . i offer mademoiselle all my sympathy . in what way can i serve you ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ miss ackroyd , ” i said , “ wants you to—to—— ” “ to find the murderer , ” said flora in a clear voice . “ i see , ” said the little man . “ but the police will do that , will they not ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ they might make a mistake , ” said flora . “ they are on their way to make a mistake now , i think . please , m. poirot , won ’ t you help us ? if—if it is a question of money—— ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot held up his hand . “ not that , i beg of you , mademoiselle . not that i do not care for money. ” his eyes showed a momentary twinkle . “ money , it means much to me and always has done . no , if i go into this , you must understand one thing clearly . _i shall go through with it to the end._ the good dog , he does not leave the scent , remember ! you may wish that , after all , you had left it to the local police . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i want the truth , ” said flora , looking him straight in the eyes . “ all the truth ? ” “ all the truth. ” “ then i accept , ” said the little man quietly . “ and i hope you will not regret those words . now , tell me all the circumstances . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ dr . sheppard had better tell you , ” said flora . “ he knows more than i do. ” thus enjoined , i plunged into a careful narrative , embodying all the facts i have previously set down . poirot listened carefully , inserting a question here and there , but for the most part sitting in silence , his eyes on the ceiling .
christie	ackroyd	i brought my story to a close with the departure of the inspector and myself from fernly park the previous night . “ and now , ” said flora , as i finished , “ tell him all about ralph . ”
christie	ackroyd	i hesitated , but her imperious glance drove me on . “ you went to this inn—this three boars—last night on your way home ? ” asked poirot , as i brought my tale to a close . “ now exactly why was that ? ”
christie	ackroyd	i paused a moment to choose my words carefully . “ i thought some one ought to inform the young man of his uncle ’ s death . it occurred to me after i had left fernly that possibly no one but myself and mr. ackroyd were aware that he was staying in the village . ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot nodded . “ quite so . that was your only motive in going there , eh ? ” “ that was my only motive , ” i said stiffly . “ it was not to—shall we say—reassure yourself about _ce jeune homme_ ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ reassure myself ? ” “ i think , m. le docteur , that you know very well what i mean , though you pretend not to do so . i suggest that it would have been a relief to you if you had found that captain paton had been at home all the evening . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ not at all , ” i said sharply . the little detective shook his head at me gravely . “ you have not the trust in me of miss flora , ” he said . “ but no matter . what we have to look at is this—captain paton is missing , under circumstances which call for an explanation . i will not hide from you that the matter looks grave . still , it may admit of a perfectly simple explanation . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ that ’ s just what i keep saying , ” cried flora eagerly . poirot touched no more upon that theme . instead he suggested an immediate visit to the local police . he thought it better for flora to return home , and for me to be the one to accompany him there and introduce him to the officer in charge of the case .
christie	ackroyd	we carried out this plan forthwith . we found inspector davis outside the police station looking very glum indeed . with him was colonel melrose , the chief constable , and another man whom , from flora ’ s description of “ weaselly , ” i had no difficulty in recognizing as inspector raglan from cranchester .
christie	ackroyd	i know melrose fairly well , and i introduced poirot to him and explained the situation . the chief constable was clearly vexed , and inspector raglan looked as black as thunder . davis , however , seemed slightly exhilarated by the sight of his superior officer ’ s annoyance .
christie	ackroyd	“ the case is going to be plain as a pikestaff , ” said raglan . “ not the least need for amateurs to come butting in . you ’ d think any fool would have seen the way things were last night , and then we shouldn ’ t have lost twelve hours . ”
christie	ackroyd	he directed a vengeful glance at poor davis , who received it with perfect stolidity . “ mr . ackroyd ’ s family must , of course , do what they see fit , ” said colonel melrose . “ but we can not have the official investigation hampered in any way . i know m. poirot ’ s great reputation , of course , ” he added courteously .
christie	ackroyd	“ the police can ’ t advertise themselves , worse luck , ” said raglan . it was poirot who saved the situation . “ it is true that i have retired from the world , ” he said . “ i never intended to take up a case again . above all things , i have a horror of publicity . i must beg , that in the case of my being able to contribute something to the solution of the mystery , my name may not be mentioned . ”
christie	ackroyd	inspector raglan ’ s face lightened a little . “ i ’ ve heard of some very remarkable successes of yours , ” observed the colonel , thawing . “ i have had much experience , ” said poirot quietly . “ but most of my successes have been obtained by the aid of the police . i admire enormously your english police . if inspector raglan permits me to assist him , i shall be both honored and flattered . ”
christie	ackroyd	the inspector ’ s countenance became still more gracious . colonel melrose drew me aside . “ from all i hear , this little fellow ’ s done some really remarkable things , ” he murmured . “ we ’ re naturally anxious not to have to call in scotland yard . raglan seems very sure of himself , but i ’ m not quite certain that i agree with him . you see , i—er—know the parties concerned better than he does . this fellow doesn ’ t seem out after kudos , does he ? would work in with us unobtrusively , eh ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ to the greater glory of inspector raglan , ” i said solemnly . “ well , well , ” said colonel melrose breezily in a louder voice , “ we must put you wise to the latest developments , m. poirot . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i thank you , ” said poirot . “ my friend , dr. sheppard , said something of the butler being suspected ? ” “ that ’ s all bunkum , ” said raglan instantly . “ these high-class servants get in such a funk that they act suspiciously for nothing at all . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ the fingerprints ? ” i hinted . “ nothing like parker ’ s. ” he gave a faint smile , and added : “ and yours and mr. raymond ’ s don ’ t fit either , doctor. ” “ what about those of captain ralph paton ? ” asked poirot quietly .
christie	ackroyd	i felt a secret admiration for the way he took the bull by the horns . i saw a look of respect creep into the inspector ’ s eye . “ i see you don ’ t let the grass grow under your feet , mr. poirot . it will be a pleasure to work with you , i ’ m sure . we ’ re going to take that young gentleman ’ s fingerprints as soon as we can lay hands upon him . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i can ’ t help thinking you ’ re mistaken , inspector , ” said colonel melrose warmly . “ i ’ ve known ralph paton from a boy upward . he ’ d never stoop to murder. ” “ maybe not , ” said the inspector tonelessly .
christie	ackroyd	“ what have you got against him ? ” i asked . “ went out just on nine o ’ clock last night . was seen in neighborhood of fernly park somewhere about nine-thirty . not been seen since . believed to be in serious money difficulties . i ’ ve got a pair of his shoes here—shoes with rubber studs in them . he had two pairs , almost exactly alike . i ’ m going up now to compare them with those footmarks . the constable is up there seeing that no one tampers with them . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ we ’ ll go at once , ” said colonel melrose . “ you and m. poirot will accompany us , will you not ? ” we assented , and all drove up in the colonel ’ s car . the inspector was anxious to get at once to the footmarks , and asked to be put down at the lodge . about half-way up the drive , on the right , a path branched off which led round to the terrace and the window of ackroyd ’ s study .
christie	ackroyd	“ would you like to go with the inspector , m. poirot ? ” asked the chief constable , “ or would you prefer to examine the study ? ” poirot chose the latter alternative . parker opened the door to us . his manner was smug and deferential , and he seemed to have recovered from his panic of the night before .
christie	ackroyd	colonel melrose took a key from his pocket , and unlocking the door which led into the lobby , he ushered us through into the study . “ except for the removal of the body , m. poirot , this room is exactly as it was last night . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ and the body was found—where ? ” as precisely as possible , i described ackroyd ’ s position . the arm-chair still stood in front of the fire . poirot went and sat down in it . “ the blue letter you speak of , where was it when you left the room ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ mr . ackroyd had laid it down on this little table at his right hand. ” poirot nodded . “ except for that , everything was in its place ? ” “ yes , i think so. ” “ colonel melrose , would you be so extremely obliging as to sit down in this chair a minute . i thank you . now , m. le docteur , will you kindly indicate to me the exact position of the dagger ? ”
christie	ackroyd	i did so , whilst the little man stood in the doorway . “ the hilt of the dagger was plainly visible from the door then . both you and parker could see it at once ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ yes. ” poirot went next to the window . “ the electric light was on , of course , when you discovered the body ? ” he asked over his shoulder . i assented , and joined him where he was studying the marks on the window-sill .
christie	ackroyd	“ the rubber studs are the same pattern as those in captain paton ’ s shoes , ” he said quietly . then he came back once more to the middle of the room . his eye traveled round , searching everything in the room with a quick , trained glance .
christie	ackroyd	“ are you a man of good observation , dr. sheppard ? ” he asked at last . “ i think so , ” i said , surprised . “ there was a fire in the grate , i see . when you broke the door down and found mr. ackroyd dead , how was the fire ? was it low ? ”
christie	ackroyd	i gave a vexed laugh . “ i—i really can ’ t say . i didn ’ t notice . perhaps mr. raymond or major blunt—— ” the little man opposite me shook his head with a faint smile .
christie	ackroyd	“ one must always proceed with method . i made an error of judgment in asking you that question . to each man his own knowledge . you could tell me the details of the patient ’ s appearance—nothing there would escape you . if i wanted information about the papers on that desk , mr. raymond would have noticed anything there was to see . to find out about the fire , i must ask the man whose business it is to observe such things . you permit—— ”
christie	ackroyd	he moved swiftly to the fireplace and rang the bell . after a lapse of a minute or two parker appeared . “ the bell rang , sir , ” he said hesitatingly . “ come in , parker , ” said colonel melrose . “ this gentleman wants to ask you something . ”
christie	ackroyd	parker transferred a respectful attention to poirot . “ parker , ” said the little man , “ when you broke down the door with dr. sheppard last night , and found your master dead , what was the state of the fire ? ”
christie	ackroyd	parker replied without a pause . “ it had burned very low , sir . it was almost out. ” “ ah ! ” said poirot . the exclamation sounded almost triumphant . he went on : — “ look round you , my good parker . is this room exactly as it was then ? ”
christie	ackroyd	the butler ’ s eye swept round . it came to rest on the windows . “ the curtains were drawn , sir , and the electric light was on. ” poirot nodded approval . “ anything else ? ” “ yes , sir , this chair was drawn out a little more . ”
christie	ackroyd	he indicated a big grandfather chair to the left of the door between it and the window . i append a plan of the room with the chair in question marked with an x .
christie	ackroyd	“ just show me , ” said poirot . [ illustration : + -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- + -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -+ | + door / grandfather | | / \ / chair + -- -+ | | / + ] | | | + / small x ] | | | \ / table + -- -+ | | + | +++ | ||| + -- -+ chair in which ___ | ||| ] | ackroyd was / \ | ||| + -- -+ found table | | | ||| \___/ | ||| | ||| | +++ + -- -+ + | | ^ ] | chair in which / \ | | | + -- -+ sheppard sat / / + | | | / / | | | desk & + / | | | fireplace chair \ / | | + -- -- -- -- -- -- + | + -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- + ]
christie	ackroyd	the butler drew the chair in question out a good two feet from the wall , turning it so that the seat faced the door . “ _voilà ce qui est curieux_ , ” murmured poirot . “ no one would want to sit in a chair in such a position , i fancy . now who pushed it back into place again , i wonder ? did you , my friend ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ no , sir , ” said parker . “ i was too upset with seeing the master and all. ” poirot looked across at me . “ did you , doctor ? ” i shook my head . “ it was back in position when i arrived with the police , sir , ” put in parker . “ i ’ m sure of that . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ curious , ” said poirot again . “ raymond or blunt must have pushed it back , ” i suggested . “ surely it isn ’ t important ? ” “ it is completely unimportant , ” said poirot . “ that is why it is so interesting , ” he added softly .
christie	ackroyd	“ excuse me a minute , ” said colonel melrose . he left the room with parker . “ do you think parker is speaking the truth ? ” i asked . “ about the chair , yes . otherwise i do not know . you will find , m. le docteur , if you have much to do with cases of this kind , that they all resemble each other in one thing . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ what is that ? ” i asked curiously . “ every one concerned in them has something to hide. ” “ have i ? ” i asked , smiling . poirot looked at me attentively . “ i think you have , ” he said quietly .
christie	ackroyd	“ but—— ” “ have you told me everything known to you about this young man paton ? ” he smiled as i grew red . “ oh ! do not fear . i will not press you . i shall learn it in good time . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i wish you ’ d tell me something of your methods , ” i said hastily , to cover my confusion . “ the point about the fire , for instance ? ” “ oh ! that was very simple . you leave mr. ackroyd at—ten minutes to nine , was it not ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ yes , exactly , i should say. ” “ the window is then closed and bolted and the door unlocked . at a quarter past ten when the body is discovered , the door is locked and the window is open . who opened it ? clearly only mr. ackroyd himself could have done so , and for one of two reasons . either because the room became unbearably hot ( but since the fire was nearly out and there was a sharp drop in temperature last night , that can not be the reason ) , or because he admitted some one that way . and if he admitted some one that way , it must have been some one well known to him , since he had previously shown himself uneasy on the subject of that same window . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ it sounds very simple , ” i said . “ everything is simple , if you arrange the facts methodically . we are concerned now with the personality of the person who was with him at nine-thirty last night . everything goes to show that that was the individual admitted by the window , and though mr. ackroyd was seen alive later by miss flora , we can not approach a solution of the mystery until we know who that visitor was . the window may have been left open after his departure and so afforded entrance to the murderer , or the same person may have returned a second time . ah ! here is the colonel who returns . ”
christie	ackroyd	colonel melrose entered with an animated manner . “ that telephone call has been traced at last , ” he said . “ it did not come from here . it was put through to dr. sheppard at 10.15 last night from a public call office at king ’ s abbot station . and at 10.23 the night mail leaves for liverpool . ”
christie	ackroyd	chapter viii inspector raglan is confident we looked at each other . “ you ’ ll have inquiries made at the station , of course ? ” i said . “ naturally , but i ’ m not over sanguine as to the result . you know what that station is like . ”
christie	ackroyd	i did . king ’ s abbot is a mere village , but its station happens to be an important junction . most of the big expresses stop there , and trains are shunted , re-sorted , and made up . it has two or three public telephone boxes . at that time of night three local trains come in close upon each other , to catch the connection with the express for the north which comes in at 10.19 and leaves at 10.23 . the whole place is in a bustle , and the chances of one particular person being noticed telephoning or getting into the express are very small indeed .
christie	ackroyd	“ but why telephone at all ? ” demanded melrose . “ that is what i find so extraordinary . there seems no rhyme or reason in the thing. ” poirot carefully straightened a china ornament on one of the bookcases .
christie	ackroyd	“ be sure there was a reason , ” he said over his shoulder . “ but what reason could it be ? ” “ when we know that , we shall know everything . this case is very curious and very interesting . ”
christie	ackroyd	there was something almost indescribable in the way he said those last words . i felt that he was looking at the case from some peculiar angle of his own , and what he saw i could not tell .
christie	ackroyd	he went to the window and stood there , looking out . “ you say it was nine o ’ clock , dr. sheppard , when you met this stranger outside the gate ? ” he asked the question without turning round .
christie	ackroyd	“ yes , ” i replied . “ i heard the church clock chime the hour. ” “ how long would it take him to reach the house—to reach this window , for instance ? ” “ five minutes at the outside . two or three minutes only if he took the path at the right of the drive and came straight here . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ but to do that he would have to know the way . how can i explain myself ? —it would mean that he had been here before—that he knew his surroundings. ” “ that is true , ” replied colonel melrose .
christie	ackroyd	“ we could find out , doubtless , if mr. ackroyd had received any strangers during the past week ? ” “ young raymond could tell us that , ” i said . “ or parker , ” suggested colonel melrose . “ _ou tous les deux_ , ” suggested poirot , smiling .
christie	ackroyd	colonel melrose went in search of raymond , and i rang the bell once more for parker . colonel melrose returned almost immediately , accompanied by the young secretary , whom he introduced to poirot . geoffrey raymond was fresh and debonair as ever . he seemed surprised and delighted to make poirot ’ s acquaintance .
christie	ackroyd	“ no idea you ’ d been living among us incognito , m. poirot , ” he said . “ it will be a great privilege to watch you at work——hallo , what ’ s this ? ” poirot had been standing just to the left of the door . now he moved aside suddenly , and i saw that while my back was turned he must have swiftly drawn out the arm-chair till it stood in the position parker had indicated .
christie	ackroyd	“ want me to sit in the chair whilst you take a blood test ? ” asked raymond good-humoredly . “ what ’ s the idea ? ” “ m . raymond , this chair was pulled out—so—last night when mr. ackroyd was found killed . some one moved it back again into place . did you do so ? ”
christie	ackroyd	the secretary ’ s reply came without a second ’ s hesitation . “ no , indeed i didn ’ t . i don ’ t even remember that it was in that position , but it must have been if you say so . anyway , somebody else must have moved it back to its proper place . have they destroyed a clew in doing so ? too bad ! ”
christie	ackroyd	“ it is of no consequence , ” said the detective . “ of no consequence whatever . what i really want to ask you is this , m. raymond : did any stranger come to see mr. ackroyd during this past week ? ”
christie	ackroyd	the secretary reflected for a minute or two , knitting his brows , and during the pause parker appeared in answer to the bell . “ no , ” said raymond at last . “ i can ’ t remember any one . can you , parker ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i beg your pardon , sir ? ” “ any stranger coming to see mr. ackroyd this week ? ” the butler reflected for a minute or two . “ there was the young man who came on wednesday , sir , ” he said at last . “ from curtis and troute , i understood he was . ”
christie	ackroyd	raymond moved this aside with an impatient hand . “ oh ! yes , i remember , but that is not the kind of stranger this gentleman means. ” he turned to poirot . “ mr . ackroyd had some idea of purchasing a dictaphone , ” he explained . “ it would have enabled us to get through a lot more work in a limited time . the firm in question sent down their representative , but nothing came of it . mr. ackroyd did not make up his mind to purchase . ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot turned to the butler . “ can you describe this young man to me , my good parker ? ” “ he was fair-haired , sir , and short . very neatly dressed in a blue serge suit . a very presentable young man , sir , for his station in life . ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot turned to me . “ the man you met outside the gate , doctor , was tall , was he not ? ” “ yes , ” i said . “ somewhere about six feet , i should say. ” “ there is nothing in that , then , ” declared the belgian . “ i thank you , parker . ”
christie	ackroyd	the butler spoke to raymond . “ mr . hammond has just arrived , sir , ” he said . “ he is anxious to know if he can be of any service , and he would be glad to have a word with you . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i ’ ll come at once , ” said the young man . he hurried out . poirot looked inquiringly at the chief constable . “ the family solicitor , m. poirot , ” said the latter . “ it is a busy time for this young m. raymond , ” murmured m. poirot . “ he has the air efficient , that one . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i believe mr. ackroyd considered him a most able secretary. ” “ he has been here—how long ? ” “ just on two years , i fancy. ” “ his duties he fulfills punctiliously . of that i am sure . in what manner does he amuse himself ? does he go in for _le sport_ ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ private secretaries haven ’ t much time for that sort of thing , ” said colonel melrose , smiling . “ raymond plays golf , i believe . and tennis in the summer time. ” “ he does not attend the courses—i should say the running of the horses ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ race meetings ? no , i don ’ t think he ’ s interested in racing. ” poirot nodded and seemed to lose interest . he glanced slowly round the study . “ i have seen , i think , all that there is to be seen here . ”
christie	ackroyd	i , too , looked round . “ if those walls could speak , ” i murmured . poirot shook his head . “ a tongue is not enough , ” he said . “ they would have to have also eyes and ears . but do not be too sure that these dead things ” —he touched the top of the bookcase as he spoke— “ are always dumb . to me they speak sometimes—chairs , tables—they have their message ! ”
christie	ackroyd	he turned away towards the door . “ what message ? ” i cried . “ what have they said to you to-day ? ” he looked over his shoulder and raised one eyebrow quizzically . “ an opened window , ” he said . “ a locked door . a chair that apparently moved itself . to all three i say , ‘ why ? ’ and i find no answer . ”
christie	ackroyd	he shook his head , puffed out his chest , and stood blinking at us . he looked ridiculously full of his own importance . it crossed my mind to wonder whether he was really any good as a detective . had his big reputation been built up on a series of lucky chances ?
christie	ackroyd	i think the same thought must have occurred to colonel melrose , for he frowned . “ anything more you want to see , m. poirot ? ” he inquired brusquely . “ you would perhaps be so kind as to show me the silver table from which the weapon was taken ? after that , i will trespass on your kindness no longer . ”
christie	ackroyd	we went to the drawing-room , but on the way the constable waylaid the colonel , and after a muttered conversation the latter excused himself and left us together . i showed poirot the silver table , and after raising the lid once or twice and letting it fall , he pushed open the window and stepped out on the terrace . i followed him .
christie	ackroyd	inspector raglan had just turned the corner of the house , and was coming towards us . his face looked grim and satisfied . “ so there you are , m. poirot , ” he said . “ well , this isn ’ t going to be much of a case . i ’ m sorry , too . a nice enough young fellow gone wrong . ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot ’ s face fell , and he spoke very mildly . “ i ’ m afraid i shall not be able to be of much aid to you , then ? ” “ next time , perhaps , ” said the inspector soothingly . “ though we don ’ t have murders every day in this quiet little corner of the world . ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot ’ s gaze took on an admiring quality . “ you have been of a marvelous promptness , ” he observed . “ how exactly did you go to work , if i may ask ? ” “ certainly , ” said the inspector . “ to begin with—method . that ’ s what i always say—method ! ”
christie	ackroyd	“ ah ! ” cried the other . “ that , too , is my watchword . method , order , and the little gray cells. ” “ the cells ? ” said the inspector , staring . “ the little gray cells of the brain , ” explained the belgian .
christie	ackroyd	“ oh , of course ; well , we all use them , i suppose. ” “ in a greater or lesser degree , ” murmured poirot . “ and there are , too , differences in quality . then there is the psychology of a crime . one must study that . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ ah ! ” said the inspector , “ you ’ ve been bitten with all this psychoanalysis stuff ? now , i ’ m a plain man—— ” “ mrs . raglan would not agree , i am sure , to that , ” said poirot , making him a little bow .
christie	ackroyd	inspector raglan , a little taken aback , bowed . “ you don ’ t understand , ” he said , grinning broadly . “ lord , what a lot of difference language makes . i ’ m telling you how i set to work . first of all , method . mr. ackroyd was last seen alive at a quarter to ten by his niece , miss flora ackroyd . that ’ s fact number one , isn ’ t it ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ if you say so. ” “ well , it is . at half-past ten , the doctor here says that mr. ackroyd has been dead at least half an hour . you stick to that , doctor ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ certainly , ” i said . “ half an hour or longer. ” “ very good . that gives us exactly a quarter of an hour in which the crime must have been committed . i make a list of every one in the house , and work through it , setting down opposite their names where they were and what they were doing between the hour of 9.45 and 10 p.m . ”
christie	ackroyd	he handed a sheet of paper to poirot . i read it over his shoulder . it ran as follows , written in a neat script : — _major blunt.—in billiard room with mr. raymond . ( latter confirms . ) _
christie	ackroyd	_mr . raymond.—billiard room . ( see above . ) _ _mrs . ackroyd.—9.45 watching billiard match . went up to bed 9.55 . ( raymond and blunt watched her up staircase . ) _ _miss ackroyd.—went straight from her uncle ’ s room upstairs . ( confirmed by parker , also housemaid , elsie dale . ) _
christie	ackroyd	_servants_ : — _parker.—went straight to butler ’ s pantry . ( confirmed by housekeeper , miss russell , who came down to speak to him about something at 9.47 , and remained at least ten minutes . ) _ _miss russell.—as above . spoke to housemaid , elsie dale , upstairs at 9.45._
christie	ackroyd	_ursula bourne ( parlormaid ) .—in her own room until 9.55 . then in servants ’ hall._ _mrs . cooper ( cook ) .—in servants ’ hall._ _gladys jones ( second housemaid ) .—in servants ’ hall._ _elsie dale.—upstairs in bedroom . seen there by miss russell and miss flora ackroyd._
christie	ackroyd	_mary thripp ( kitchenmaid ) .—servants ’ hall._ “ the cook has been here seven years , the parlormaid eighteen months , and parker just over a year . the others are new . except for something fishy about parker , they all seem quite all right . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ a very complete list , ” said poirot , handing it back to him . “ i am quite sure that parker did not do the murder , ” he added gravely . “ so is my sister , ” i struck in . “ and she ’ s usually right. ” nobody paid any attention to my interpolation .
christie	ackroyd	“ that disposes pretty effectually of the household , ” continued the inspector . “ now we come to a very grave point . the woman at the lodge—mary black—was pulling the curtains last night when she saw ralph paton turn in at the gate and go up towards the house . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ she is sure of that ? ” i asked sharply . “ quite sure . she knows him well by sight . he went past very quickly and turned off by the path to the right , which is a short cut to the terrace . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ and what time was that ? ” asked poirot , who had sat with an immovable face . “ exactly twenty-five minutes past nine , ” said the inspector gravely . there was a silence . then the inspector spoke again .
christie	ackroyd	“ it ’ s all clear enough . it fits in without a flaw . at twenty-five minutes past nine , captain paton is seen passing the lodge ; at nine-thirty or thereabouts , mr. geoffrey raymond hears some one in here asking for money and mr. ackroyd refusing . what happens next ? captain paton leaves the same way—through the window . he walks along the terrace , angry and baffled . he comes to the open drawing-room window . say it ’ s now a quarter to ten . miss flora ackroyd is saying good-night to her uncle . major blunt , mr. raymond , and mrs. ackroyd are in the billiard room . the drawing-room is empty . he steals in , takes the dagger from the silver table , and returns to the study window . he slips off his shoes , climbs in , and—well , i don ’ t need to go into details . then he slips out again and goes off . hadn ’ t the nerve to go back to the inn . he makes for the station , rings up from there—— ”
christie	ackroyd	“ why ? ” said poirot softly . i jumped at the interruption . the little man was leaning forward . his eyes shone with a queer green light . for a moment inspector raglan was taken aback by the question .
christie	ackroyd	“ it ’ s difficult to say exactly why he did that , ” he said at last . “ but murderers do funny things . you ’ d know that if you were in the police force . the cleverest of them make stupid mistakes sometimes . but come along and i ’ ll show you those footprints . ”
christie	ackroyd	we followed him round the corner of the terrace to the study window . at a word from raglan a police constable produced the shoes which had been obtained from the local inn .
christie	ackroyd	the inspector laid them over the marks . “ they ’ re the same , ” he said confidently . “ that is to say , they ’ re not the same pair that actually made these prints . he went away in those . this is a pair just like them , but older—see how the studs are worn down . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ surely a great many people wear shoes with rubber studs in them ? ” asked poirot . “ that ’ s so , of course , ” said the inspector . “ i shouldn ’ t put so much stress on the footmarks if it wasn ’ t for everything else . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ a very foolish young man , captain ralph paton , ” said poirot thoughtfully . “ to leave so much evidence of his presence. ” “ ah ! well , ” said the inspector , “ it was a dry , fine night , you know . he left no prints on the terrace or on the graveled path . but , unluckily for him , a spring must have welled up just lately at the end of the path from the drive . see here . ”
christie	ackroyd	a small graveled path joined the terrace a few feet away . in one spot , a few yards from its termination , the ground was wet and boggy . crossing this wet place there were again the marks of footsteps , and amongst them the shoes with rubber studs .
christie	ackroyd	poirot followed the path on a little way , the inspector by his side . “ you noticed the women ’ s footprints ? ” he said suddenly . the inspector laughed . “ naturally . but several different women have walked this way—and men as well . it ’ s a regular short cut to the house , you see . it would be impossible to sort out all the footsteps . after all , it ’ s the ones on the window-sill that are really important . ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot nodded . “ it ’ s no good going farther , ” said the inspector , as we came in view of the drive . “ it ’ s all graveled again here , and hard as it can be. ” again poirot nodded , but his eyes were fixed on a small garden house—a kind of superior summer-house . it was a little to the left of the path ahead of us , and a graveled walk ran up to it .
christie	ackroyd	poirot lingered about until the inspector had gone back towards the house . then he looked at me . “ you must have indeed been sent from the good god to replace my friend hastings , ” he said , with a twinkle . “ i observe that you do not quit my side . how say you , dr. sheppard , shall we investigate that summer-house ? it interests me . ”
christie	ackroyd	he went up to the door and opened it . inside , the place was almost dark . there were one or two rustic seats , a croquet set , and some folded deck-chairs . i was startled to observe my new friend . he had dropped to his hands and knees and was crawling about the floor . every now and then he shook his head as though not satisfied . finally , he sat back on his heels .
christie	ackroyd	“ nothing , ” he murmured . “ well , perhaps it was not to be expected . but it would have meant so much—— ” he broke off , stiffening all over . then he stretched out his hand to one of the rustic chairs . he detached something from one side of it .
christie	ackroyd	“ what is it ? ” i cried . “ what have you found ? ” he smiled , unclosing his hand so that i should see what lay in the palm of it . a scrap of stiff white cambric .
christie	ackroyd	i took it from him , looked at it curiously , and then handed it back . “ what do you make of it , eh , my friend ? ” he asked , eyeing me keenly . “ a scrap torn from a handkerchief , ” i suggested , shrugging my shoulders .
christie	ackroyd	he made another dart and picked up a small quill—a goose quill by the look of it . “ and that ? ” he cried triumphantly . “ what do you make of that ? ” i only stared .
christie	ackroyd	he slipped the quill into his pocket , and looked again at the scrap of white stuff . “ a fragment of a handkerchief ? ” he mused . “ perhaps you are right . but remember this—_a good laundry does not starch a handkerchief_ . ”
christie	ackroyd	he nodded at me triumphantly , then he put away the scrap carefully in his pocket-book . chapter ix the goldfish pond we walked back to the house together . there was no sign of the inspector . poirot paused on the terrace and stood with his back to the house , slowly turning his head from side to side .
christie	ackroyd	“ _une belle propriété_ , ” he said at last appreciatively . “ who inherits it ? ” his words gave me almost a shock . it is an odd thing , but until that moment the question of inheritance had never come into my head . poirot watched me keenly .
christie	ackroyd	“ it is a new idea to you , that , ” he said at last . “ you had not thought of it before—eh ? ” “ no , ” i said truthfully . “ i wish i had. ” he looked at me again curiously .
christie	ackroyd	“ i wonder just what you mean by that , ” he said thoughtfully . “ ah ! no , ” as i was about to speak . “ _inutile ! _ you would not tell me your real thought. ” “ every one has something to hide , ” i quoted , smiling .
christie	ackroyd	“ exactly. ” “ you still believe that ? ” “ more than ever , my friend . but it is not easy to hide things from hercule poirot . he has a knack of finding out. ” he descended the steps of the dutch garden as he spoke .
christie	ackroyd	“ let us walk a little , ” he said over his shoulder . “ the air is pleasant to-day. ” i followed him . he led me down a path to the left enclosed in yew hedges . a walk led down the middle , bordered each side with formal flower beds , and at the end was a round paved recess with a seat and a pond of goldfish . instead of pursuing the path to the end , poirot took another which wound up the side of a wooded slope . in one spot the trees had been cleared away , and a seat had been put . sitting there one had a splendid view over the countryside , and one looked right down on the paved recess and the goldfish pond .
christie	ackroyd	“ england is very beautiful , ” said poirot , his eyes straying over the prospect . then he smiled . “ and so are english girls , ” he said in a lower tone . “ hush , my friend , and look at the pretty picture below us . ”
christie	ackroyd	it was then that i saw flora . she was moving along the path we had just left and she was humming a little snatch of song . her step was more dancing than walking , and in spite of her black dress , there was nothing but joy in her whole attitude . she gave a sudden pirouette on her toes , and her black draperies swung out . at the same time she flung her head back and laughed outright .
christie	ackroyd	as she did so a man stepped out from the trees . it was hector blunt . the girl started . her expression changed a little . “ how you startled me—i didn ’ t see you . ”
christie	ackroyd	blunt said nothing , but stood looking at her for a minute or two in silence . “ what i like about you , ” said flora , with a touch of malice , “ is your cheery conversation . ”
christie	ackroyd	i fancy that at that blunt reddened under his tan . his voice , when he spoke , sounded different—it had a curious sort of humility in it . “ never was much of a fellow for talking . not even when i was young . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ that was a very long time ago , i suppose , ” said flora gravely . i caught the undercurrent of laughter in her voice , but i don ’ t think blunt did . “ yes , ” he said simply , “ it was . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ how does it feel to be methuselah ? ” asked flora . this time the laughter was more apparent , but blunt was following out an idea of his own . “ remember the johnny who sold his soul to the devil ? in return for being made young again ? there ’ s an opera about it . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ faust , you mean ? ” “ that ’ s the beggar . rum story . some of us would do it if we could. ” “ any one would think you were creaking at the joints to hear you talk , ” cried flora , half vexed , half amused .
christie	ackroyd	blunt said nothing for a minute or two . then he looked away from flora into the middle distance and observed to an adjacent tree trunk that it was about time he got back to africa .
christie	ackroyd	“ are you going on another expedition—shooting things ? ” “ expect so . usually do , you know—shoot things , i mean. ” “ you shot that head in the hall , didn ’ t you ? ” blunt nodded . then he jerked out , going rather red , as he did so : —
christie	ackroyd	“ care for some decent skins any time ? if so , i could get ’ em for you. ” “ oh ! please do , ” cried flora . “ will you really ? you won ’ t forget ? ” “ i shan ’ t forget , ” said hector blunt .
christie	ackroyd	he added , in a sudden burst of communicativeness : — “ time i went . i ’ m no good in this sort of life . haven ’ t got the manners for it . i ’ m a rough fellow , no use in society . never remember the things one ’ s expected to say . yes , time i went . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ but you ’ re not going at once , ” cried flora . “ not—not while we ’ re in all this trouble . oh ! please . if you go—— ” she turned away a little . “ you want me to stay ? ” asked blunt .
christie	ackroyd	he spoke deliberately but quite simply . “ we all—— ” “ i meant you personally , ” said blunt , with directness . flora turned slowly back again and met his eyes . “ i want you to stay , ” she said , “ if—if that makes any difference . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ it makes all the difference , ” said blunt . there was a moment ’ s silence . they sat down on the stone seat by the goldfish pond . it seemed as though neither of them knew quite what to say next .
christie	ackroyd	“ it—it ’ s such a lovely morning , ” said flora at last . “ you know , i can ’ t help feeling happy , in spite—in spite of everything . that ’ s awful , i suppose ? ” “ quite natural , ” said blunt . “ never saw your uncle until two years ago , did you ? can ’ t be expected to grieve very much . much better to have no humbug about it . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ there ’ s something awfully consoling about you , ” said flora . “ you make things so simple. ” “ things are simple as a rule , ” said the big game hunter . “ not always , ” said flora . her voice had lowered itself , and i saw blunt turn and look at her , bringing his eyes back from ( apparently ) the coast of africa to do so . he evidently put his own construction on her change of tone , for he said , after a minute or two , in rather an abrupt manner : —
christie	ackroyd	“ i say , you know , you mustn ’ t worry . about that young chap , i mean . inspector ’ s an ass . everybody knows—utterly absurd to think he could have done it . man from outside . burglar chap . that ’ s the only possible solution . ”
christie	ackroyd	flora turned to look at him . “ you really think so ? ” “ don ’ t you ? ” said blunt quickly . “ i—oh , yes , of course. ” another silence , and then flora burst out : — “ i ’ m—i ’ ll tell you why i felt so happy this morning . however heartless you think me , i ’ d rather tell you . it ’ s because the lawyer has been—mr . hammond . he told us about the will . uncle roger has left me twenty thousand pounds . think of it—twenty thousand beautiful pounds . ”
christie	ackroyd	blunt looked surprised . “ does it mean so much to you ? ” “ mean much to me ? why , it ’ s everything . freedom—life—no more scheming and scraping and lying—— ” “ lying ? ” said blunt , sharply interrupting . flora seemed taken aback for a minute .
christie	ackroyd	“ you know what i mean , ” she said uncertainly . “ pretending to be thankful for all the nasty castoff things rich relations give you . last year ’ s coats and skirts and hats. ” “ don ’ t know much about ladies ’ clothes ; should have said you were always very well turned out . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ it ’ s cost me something , though , ” said flora in a low voice . “ don ’ t let ’ s talk of horrid things . i ’ m so happy . i ’ m free . free to do what i like . free not to—— ”
christie	ackroyd	she stopped suddenly . “ not to what ? ” asked blunt quickly . “ i forget now . nothing important. ” blunt had a stick in his hand , and he thrust it into the pond , poking at something .
christie	ackroyd	“ what are you doing , major blunt ? ” “ there ’ s something bright down there . wondered what it was—looks like a gold brooch . now i ’ ve stirred up the mud and it ’ s gone. ” “ perhaps it ’ s a crown , ” suggested flora . “ like the one mélisande saw in the water . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ mélisande , ” said blunt reflectively— “ she ’ s in an opera , isn ’ t she ? ” “ yes , you seem to know a lot about operas. ” “ people take me sometimes , ” said blunt sadly . “ funny idea of pleasure—worse racket than the natives make with their tom-toms . ”
christie	ackroyd	flora laughed . “ i remember mélisande , ” continued blunt , “ married an old chap old enough to be her father. ” he threw a small piece of flint into the goldfish pond . then , with a change of manner , he turned to flora .
christie	ackroyd	“ miss ackroyd , can i do anything ? about paton , i mean . i know how dreadfully anxious you must be. ” “ thank you , ” said flora in a cold voice . “ there is really nothing to be done . ralph will be all right . i ’ ve got hold of the most wonderful detective in the world , and he ’ s going to find out all about it . ”
christie	ackroyd	for some time i had felt uneasy as to our position . we were not exactly eavesdropping , since the two in the garden below had only to lift their heads to see us . nevertheless , i should have drawn attention to our presence before now , had not my companion put a warning pressure on my arm . clearly he wished me to remain silent .
christie	ackroyd	but now he rose briskly to his feet , clearing his throat . “ i demand pardon , ” he cried . “ i can not allow mademoiselle thus extravagantly to compliment me , and not draw attention to my presence . they say the listener hears no good of himself , but that is not the case this time . to spare my blushes , i must join you and apologize . ”
christie	ackroyd	he hurried down the path with me close behind him , and joined the others by the pond . “ this is m. hercule poirot , ” said flora . “ i expect you ’ ve heard of him . ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot bowed . “ i know major blunt by reputation , ” he said politely . “ i am glad to have encountered you , monsieur . i am in need of some information that you can give me . ”
christie	ackroyd	blunt looked at him inquiringly . “ when did you last see m. ackroyd alive ? ” “ at dinner. ” “ and you neither saw nor heard anything of him after that ? ” “ didn ’ t see him . heard his voice . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ how was that ? ” “ i strolled out on the terrace—— ” “ pardon me , what time was this ? ” “ about half-past nine . i was walking up and down smoking in front of the drawing-room window . i heard ackroyd talking in his study—— ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot stooped and removed a microscopic weed . “ surely you couldn ’ t hear voices in the study from that part of the terrace , ” he murmured . he was not looking at blunt , but i was , and to my intense surprise , i saw the latter flush .
christie	ackroyd	“ went as far as the corner , ” he explained unwillingly . “ ah ! indeed ? ” said poirot . in the mildest manner he conveyed an impression that more was wanted . “ thought i saw—a woman disappearing into the bushes . just a gleam of white , you know . must have been mistaken . it was while i was standing at the corner of the terrace that i heard ackroyd ’ s voice speaking to that secretary of his . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ speaking to mr. geoffrey raymond ? ” “ yes—that ’ s what i supposed at the time . seems i was wrong. ” “ mr . ackroyd didn ’ t address him by name ? ” “ oh , no. ” “ then , if i may ask , why did you think—— ? ”
christie	ackroyd	blunt explained laboriously . “ took it for granted that it _would_ be raymond , because he had said just before i came out that he was taking some papers to ackroyd . never thought of it being anybody else . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ can you remember what the words you heard were ? ” “ afraid i can ’ t . something quite ordinary and unimportant . only caught a scrap of it . i was thinking of something else at the time . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ it is of no importance , ” murmured poirot . “ did you move a chair back against the wall when you went into the study after the body was discovered ? ” “ chair ? no—why should i ? ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot shrugged his shoulders but did not answer . he turned to flora . “ there is one thing i should like to know from you , mademoiselle . when you were examining the things in the silver table with dr. sheppard , was the dagger in its place , or was it not ? ”
christie	ackroyd	flora ’ s chin shot up . “ inspector raglan has been asking me that , ” she said resentfully . “ i ’ ve told him , and i ’ ll tell you . i ’ m perfectly certain the dagger was _not_ there . he thinks it was and that ralph sneaked it later in the evening . and—and he doesn ’ t believe me . he thinks i ’ m saying it to—to shield ralph . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ and aren ’ t you ? ” i asked gravely . flora stamped her foot . “ you , too , dr. sheppard ! oh ! it ’ s too bad. ” poirot tactfully made a diversion . “ it is true what i heard you say , major blunt . there is something that glitters in this pond . let us see if i can reach it . ”
christie	ackroyd	he knelt down by the pond , baring his arm to the elbow , and lowered it in very slowly , so as not to disturb the bottom of the pond . but in spite of all his precautions the mud eddied and swirled , and he was forced to draw his arm out again empty-handed .
christie	ackroyd	he gazed ruefully at the mud upon his arm . i offered him my handkerchief , which he accepted with fervent protestations of thanks . blunt looked at his watch . “ nearly lunch time , ” he said . “ we ’ d better be getting back to the house . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ you will lunch with us , m. poirot ? ” asked flora . “ i should like you to meet my mother . she is—very fond of ralph. ” the little man bowed . “ i shall be delighted , mademoiselle . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ and you will stay , too , won ’ t you , dr. sheppard ? ” i hesitated . “ oh , do ! ” i wanted to , so i accepted the invitation without further ceremony . we set out towards the house , flora and blunt walking ahead .
christie	ackroyd	“ what hair , ” said poirot to me in a low tone , nodding towards flora . “ the real gold ! they will make a pretty couple . she and the dark , handsome captain paton . will they not ? ”
christie	ackroyd	i looked at him inquiringly , but he began to fuss about a few microscopic drops of water on his coat sleeve . the man reminded me in some ways of a cat . his green eyes and his finicking habits .
christie	ackroyd	“ and all for nothing , too , ” i said sympathetically . “ i wonder what it was in the pond ? ” “ would you like to see ? ” asked poirot . i stared at him . he nodded . “ my good friend , ” he said gently and reproachfully , “ hercule poirot does not run the risk of disarranging his costume without being sure of attaining his object . to do so would be ridiculous and absurd . i am never ridiculous . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ but you brought your hand out empty , ” i objected . “ there are times when it is necessary to have discretion . do you tell your patients everything—everything , doctor ? i think not . nor do you tell your excellent sister everything either , is it not so ? before showing my empty hand , i dropped what it contained into my other hand . you shall see what that was . ”
christie	ackroyd	he held out his left hand , palm open . on it lay a little circlet of gold . a woman ’ s wedding ring . i took it from him . “ look inside , ” commanded poirot . i did so . inside was an inscription in fine writing : —
christie	ackroyd	_from r. , march 13th._ i looked at poirot , but he was busy inspecting his appearance in a tiny pocket glass . he paid particular attention to his mustaches , and none at all to me . i saw that he did not intend to be communicative .
christie	ackroyd	chapter x the parlormaid we found mrs. ackroyd in the hall . with her was a small dried-up little man , with an aggressive chin and sharp gray eyes , and “ lawyer ” written all over him .
christie	ackroyd	“ mr . hammond is staying to lunch with us , ” said mrs. ackroyd . “ you know major blunt , mr. hammond ? and dear dr. sheppard—also a close friend of poor roger ’ s . and , let me see—— ”
christie	ackroyd	she paused , surveying hercule poirot in some perplexity . “ this is m. poirot , mother , ” said flora . “ i told you about him this morning. ” “ oh ! yes , ” said mrs. ackroyd vaguely . “ of course , my dear , of course . he is to find ralph , is he not ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ he is to find out who killed uncle , ” said flora . “ oh ! my dear , ” cried her mother . “ please ! my poor nerves . i am a wreck this morning , a positive wreck . such a dreadful thing to happen . i can ’ t help feeling that it must have been an accident of some kind . roger was so fond of handling queer curios . his hand must have slipped , or something . ”
christie	ackroyd	this theory was received in polite silence . i saw poirot edge up to the lawyer , and speak to him in a confidential undertone . they moved aside into the embrasure of the window . i joined them—then hesitated .
christie	ackroyd	“ perhaps i ’ m intruding , ” i said . “ not at all , ” cried poirot heartily . “ you and i , m. le docteur , we investigate this affair side by side . without you i should be lost . i desire a little information from the good mr. hammond . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ you are acting on behalf of captain ralph paton , i understand , ” said the lawyer cautiously . poirot shook his head . “ not so . i am acting in the interests of justice . miss ackroyd has asked me to investigate the death of her uncle . ”
christie	ackroyd	mr. hammond seemed slightly taken aback . “ i can not seriously believe that captain paton can be concerned in this crime , ” he said , “ however strong the circumstantial evidence against him may be . the mere fact that he was hard pressed for money—— ”
christie	ackroyd	“ was he hard pressed for money ? ” interpolated poirot quickly . the lawyer shrugged his shoulders . “ it was a chronic condition with ralph paton , ” he said dryly . “ money went through his hands like water . he was always applying to his stepfather . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ had he done so of late ? during the last year , for instance ? ” “ i can not say . mr. ackroyd did not mention the fact to me. ” “ i comprehend . mr. hammond , i take it that you are acquainted with the provisions of mr. ackroyd ’ s will ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ certainly . that is my principal business here to-day. ” “ then , seeing that i am acting for miss ackroyd , you will not object to telling me the terms of that will ? ” “ they are quite simple . shorn of legal phraseology , and after paying certain legacies and bequests—— ”
christie	ackroyd	“ such as—— ? ” interrupted poirot . mr. hammond seemed a little surprised . “ a thousand pounds to his housekeeper , miss russell ; fifty pounds to the cook , emma cooper ; five hundred pounds to his secretary , mr. geoffrey raymond . then to various hospitals—— ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot held up his hand . “ ah ! the charitable bequests , they interest me not. ” “ quite so . the income on ten thousand pounds ’ worth of shares to be paid to mrs. cecil ackroyd during her lifetime . miss flora ackroyd inherits twenty thousand pounds outright . the residue—including this property , and the shares in ackroyd and son—to his adopted son , ralph paton . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ mr . ackroyd possessed a large fortune ? ” “ a very large fortune . captain paton will be an exceedingly wealthy young man. ” there was a silence . poirot and the lawyer looked at each other .
christie	ackroyd	“ mr . hammond , ” came mrs. ackroyd ’ s voice plaintively from the fireplace . the lawyer answered the summons . poirot took my arm and drew me right into the window . “ regard the irises , ” he remarked in rather a loud voice . “ magnificent , are they not ? a straight and pleasing effect . ”
christie	ackroyd	at the same time i felt the pressure of his hand on my arm , and he added in a low tone : — “ do you really wish to aid me ? to take part in this investigation ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ yes , indeed , ” i said eagerly . “ there ’ s nothing i should like better . you don ’ t know what a dull old fogey ’ s life i lead . never anything out of the ordinary. ” “ good , we will be colleagues then . in a minute or two i fancy major blunt will join us . he is not happy with the good mamma . now there are some things i want to know—but i do not wish to seem to want to know them . you comprehend ? so it will be your part to ask the questions . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ what questions do you want me to ask ? ” i asked apprehensively . “ i want you to introduce the name of mrs. ferrars. ” “ yes ? ” “ speak of her in a natural fashion . ask him if he was down here when her husband died . you understand the kind of thing i mean . and while he replies , watch his face without seeming to watch it . _c ’ est compris ? _ ”
christie	ackroyd	there was no time for more , for at that minute , as poirot had prophesied , blunt left the others in his abrupt fashion and came over to us . i suggested strolling on the terrace , and he acquiesced . poirot stayed behind .
christie	ackroyd	i stopped to examine a late rose . “ how things change in the course of a day or so , ” i observed . “ i was up here last wednesday , i remember , walking up and down this same terrace . ackroyd was with me—full of spirits . and now—three days later—ackroyd ’ s dead , poor fellow , mrs. ferrars ’ s dead—you knew her , didn ’ t you ? but of course you did . ”
christie	ackroyd	blunt nodded his head . “ had you seen her since you ’ d been down this time ? ” “ went with ackroyd to call . last tuesday , think it was . fascinating woman—but something queer about her . deep—one would never know what she was up to . ”
christie	ackroyd	i looked into his steady gray eyes . nothing there surely . i went on : — “ i suppose you ’ d met her before. ” “ last time i was here—she and her husband had just come here to live. ” he paused a minute and then added : “ rum thing , she had changed a lot between then and now . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ how—changed ? ” i asked . “ looked ten years older. ” “ were you down here when her husband died ? ” i asked , trying to make the question sound as casual as possible . “ no . from all i heard it would be a good riddance . uncharitable , perhaps , but the truth . ”
christie	ackroyd	i agreed . “ ashley ferrars was by no means a pattern husband , ” i said cautiously . “ blackguard , i thought , ” said blunt . “ no , ” i said , “ only a man with more money than was good for him . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ oh ! money ! all the troubles in the world can be put down to money—or the lack of it. ” “ which has been your particular trouble ? ” i asked . “ i ’ ve enough for what i want . i ’ m one of the lucky ones . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ indeed. ” “ i ’ m not too flush just now , as a matter of fact . came into a legacy a year ago , and like a fool let myself be persuaded into putting it into some wild-cat scheme . ”
christie	ackroyd	i sympathized , and narrated my own similar trouble . then the gong pealed out , and we all went in to lunch . poirot drew me back a little . “ _eh ! bien ? _ ” “ he ’ s all right , ” i said . “ i ’ m sure of it . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ nothing—disturbing ? ” “ he had a legacy just a year ago , ” i said . “ but why not ? why shouldn ’ t he ? i ’ ll swear the man is perfectly square and aboveboard. ” “ without doubt , without doubt , ” said poirot soothingly . “ do not upset yourself . ”
christie	ackroyd	he spoke as though to a fractious child . we all trooped into the dining-room . it seemed incredible that less than twenty-four hours had passed since i last sat at that table .
christie	ackroyd	afterwards , mrs. ackroyd took me aside and sat down with me on a sofa . “ i can ’ t help feeling a little hurt , ” she murmured , producing a handkerchief of the kind obviously not meant to be cried into . “ hurt , i mean , by roger ’ s lack of confidence in me . that twenty thousand pounds ought to have been left to _me_—not to flora . a mother could be trusted to safeguard the interests of her child . a lack of trust , i call it . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ you forget , mrs. ackroyd , ” i said , “ flora was ackroyd ’ s own niece , a blood relation . it would have been different had you been his sister instead of his sister-in-law. ” “ as poor cecil ’ s widow , i think my feelings ought to have been considered , ” said the lady , touching her eye-lashes gingerly with the handkerchief . “ but roger was always most peculiar—not to say _mean_—about money matters . it has been a most difficult position for both flora and myself . he did not even give the poor child an allowance . he would pay her bills , you know , and even that with a good deal of reluctance and asking what she wanted all those fal-lals for—so like a man—but—now i ’ ve forgotten what it was i was going to say ! oh , yes , not a penny we could call our own , you know . flora resented it—yes , i must say she resented it—very strongly . though devoted to her uncle , of course . but any girl would have resented it . yes , i must say roger had very strange ideas about money . he wouldn ’ t even buy new face towels , though i told him the old ones were in holes . and then , ” proceeded mrs. ackroyd , with a sudden leap highly characteristic of her conversation , “ to leave all that money—a thousand pounds—fancy , a thousand pounds ! —to that woman . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ what woman ? ” “ that russell woman . something very queer about her , and so i ’ ve always said . but roger wouldn ’ t hear a word against her . said she was a woman of great force of character , and that he admired and respected her . he was always going on about her rectitude and independence and moral worth . _i_ think there ’ s something fishy about her . she was certainly doing her best to marry roger . but i soon put a stop to that . she ’ s always hated me . naturally . _i_ saw through her . ”
christie	ackroyd	i began to wonder if there was any chance of stemming mrs. ackroyd ’ s eloquence , and getting away . mr. hammond provided the necessary diversion by coming up to say good-by . i seized my chance and rose also .
christie	ackroyd	“ about the inquest , ” i said . “ where would you prefer it to be held . here , or at the three boars ? ” mrs. ackroyd stared at me with a dropped jaw . “ the inquest ? ” she asked , the picture of consternation . “ but surely there won ’ t have to be an inquest ? ”
christie	ackroyd	mr. hammond gave a dry little cough and murmured , “ inevitable . under the circumstances , ” in two short little barks . “ but surely dr. sheppard can arrange—— ” “ there are limits to my powers of arrangement , ” i said dryly .
christie	ackroyd	“ if his death was an accident—— ” “ he was murdered , mrs. ackroyd , ” i said brutally . she gave a little cry . “ no theory of accident will hold water for a minute. ” mrs. ackroyd looked at me in distress . i had no patience with what i thought was her silly fear of unpleasantness .
christie	ackroyd	“ if there ’ s an inquest , i—i shan ’ t have to answer questions and all that , shall i ? ” she asked . “ i don ’ t know what will be necessary , ” i answered . “ i imagine mr. raymond will take the brunt of it off you . he knows all the circumstances , and can give formal evidence of identification . ”
christie	ackroyd	the lawyer assented with a little bow . “ i really don ’ t think there is anything to dread , mrs. ackroyd , ” he said . “ you will be spared all unpleasantness . now , as to the question of money , have you all you need for the present ? i mean , ” he added , as she looked at him inquiringly , “ ready money . cash , you know . if not , i can arrange to let you have whatever you require . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ that ought to be all right , ” said raymond , who was standing by . “ mr . ackroyd cashed a cheque for a hundred pounds yesterday. ” “ a hundred pounds ? ” “ yes . for wages and other expenses due to-day . at the moment it is still intact . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ where is this money ? in his desk ? ” “ no , he always kept his cash in his bedroom . in an old collar-box , to be accurate . funny idea , wasn ’ t it ? ” “ i think , ” said the lawyer , “ we ought to make sure the money is there before i leave . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ certainly , ” agreed the secretary . “ i ’ ll take you up now .... oh ! i forgot . the door ’ s locked. ” inquiry from parker elicited the information that inspector raglan was in the housekeeper ’ s room asking a few supplementary questions . a few minutes later the inspector joined the party in the hall , bringing the key with him . he unlocked the door and we passed into the lobby and up the small staircase . at the top of the stairs the door into ackroyd ’ s bedroom stood open . inside the room it was dark , the curtains were drawn , and the bed was turned down just as it had been last night . the inspector drew the curtains , letting in the sunlight , and geoffrey raymond went to the top drawer of a rosewood bureau .
christie	ackroyd	“ he kept his money like that , in an unlocked drawer . just fancy , ” commented the inspector . the secretary flushed a little . “ mr . ackroyd had perfect faith in the honesty of all the servants , ” he said hotly .
christie	ackroyd	“ oh ! quite so , ” said the inspector hastily . raymond opened the drawer , took out a round leather collar-box from the back of it , and opening it , drew out a thick wallet .
christie	ackroyd	“ here is the money , ” he said , taking out a fat roll of notes . “ you will find the hundred intact , i know , for mr. ackroyd put it in the collar-box in my presence last night when he was dressing for dinner , and of course it has not been touched since . ”
christie	ackroyd	mr. hammond took the roll from him and counted it . he looked up sharply . “ a hundred pounds , you said . but there is only sixty here. ” raymond stared at him . “ impossible , ” he cried , springing forward . taking the notes from the other ’ s hand , he counted them aloud .
christie	ackroyd	mr. hammond had been right . the total amounted to sixty pounds . “ but—i can ’ t understand it , ” cried the secretary , bewildered . poirot asked a question . “ you saw mr. ackroyd put this money away last night when he was dressing for dinner ? you are sure he had not paid away any of it already ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i ’ m sure he hadn ’ t . he even said , ‘ i don ’ t want to take a hundred pounds down to dinner with me . too bulgy. ’ ” “ then the affair is very simple , ” remarked poirot . “ either he paid out that forty pounds sometime last evening , or else it has been stolen . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ that ’ s the matter in a nutshell , ” agreed the inspector . he turned to mrs. ackroyd . “ which of the servants would come in here yesterday evening ? ” “ i suppose the housemaid would turn down the bed . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ who is she ? what do you know about her ? ” “ she ’ s not been here very long , ” said mrs. ackroyd . “ but she ’ s a nice ordinary country girl. ” “ i think we ought to clear this matter up , ” said the inspector . “ if mr. ackroyd paid that money away himself , it may have a bearing on the mystery of the crime . the other servants all right , as far as you know ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ oh , i think so. ” “ not missed anything before ? ” “ no. ” “ none of them leaving , or anything like that ? ” “ the parlormaid is leaving. ” “ when ? ” “ she gave notice yesterday , i believe. ” “ to you ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ oh , no . _i_ have nothing to do with the servants . miss russell attends to the household matters. ” the inspector remained lost in thought for a minute or two . then he nodded his head and remarked , “ i think i ’ d better have a word with miss russell , and i ’ ll see the girl dale as well . ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot and i accompanied him to the housekeeper ’ s room . miss russell received us with her usual sang-froid . elsie dale had been at fernly five months . a nice girl , quick at her duties , and most respectable . good references . the last girl in the world to take anything not belonging to her .
christie	ackroyd	what about the parlormaid ? “ she , too , was a most superior girl . very quiet and ladylike . an excellent worker. ” “ then why is she leaving ? ” asked the inspector . miss russell pursed up her lips .
christie	ackroyd	“ it was none of my doing . i understand mr. ackroyd found fault with her yesterday afternoon . it was her duty to do the study , and she disarranged some of the papers on his desk , i believe . he was very annoyed about it , and she gave notice . at least , that is what i understood from her , but perhaps you ’ d like to see her yourselves ? ”
christie	ackroyd	the inspector assented . i had already noticed the girl when she was waiting on us at lunch . a tall girl , with a lot of brown hair rolled tightly away at the back of her neck , and very steady gray eyes . she came in answer to the housekeeper ’ s summons , and stood very straight with those same gray eyes fixed on us .
christie	ackroyd	“ you are ursula bourne ? ” asked the inspector . “ yes , sir. ” “ i understand you are leaving ? ” “ yes , sir. ” “ why is that ? ” “ i disarranged some papers on mr. ackroyd ’ s desk . he was very angry about it , and i said i had better leave . he told me to go as soon as possible . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ were you in mr. ackroyd ’ s bedroom at all last night ? tidying up or anything ? ” “ no , sir . that is elsie ’ s work . i never went near that part of the house. ” “ i must tell you , my girl , that a large sum of money is missing from mr. ackroyd ’ s room . ”
christie	ackroyd	at last i saw her roused . a wave of color swept over her face . “ i know nothing about any money . if you think i took it , and that that is why mr. ackroyd dismissed me , you are wrong . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i ’ m not accusing you of taking it , my girl , ” said the inspector . “ don ’ t flare up so. ” the girl looked at him coldly . “ you can search my things if you like , ” she said disdainfully . “ but you won ’ t find anything . ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot suddenly interposed . “ it was yesterday afternoon that mr. ackroyd dismissed you—or you dismissed yourself , was it not ? ” he asked . the girl nodded . “ how long did the interview last ? ” “ the interview ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ yes , the interview between you and mr. ackroyd in the study ? ” “ i—i don ’ t know. ” “ twenty minutes ? half an hour ? ” “ something like that. ” “ not longer ? ” “ not longer than half an hour , certainly . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ thank you , mademoiselle. ” i looked curiously at him . he was rearranging a few objects on the table , setting them straight with precise fingers . his eyes were shining . “ that ’ ll do , ” said the inspector .
christie	ackroyd	ursula bourne disappeared . the inspector turned to miss russell . “ how long has she been here ? have you got a copy of the reference you had with her ? ” without answering the first question , miss russell moved to an adjacent bureau , opened one of the drawers , and took out a handful of letters clipped together with a patent fastener . she selected one and handed it to the inspector .
christie	ackroyd	“ h ’ m , ” said he . “ reads all right . mrs. richard folliott , marby grange , marby . who ’ s this woman ? ” “ quite good county people , ” said miss russell . “ well , ” said the inspector , handing it back , “ let ’ s have a look at the other one , elsie dale . ”
christie	ackroyd	elsie dale was a big fair girl , with a pleasant but slightly stupid face . she answered our questions readily enough , and showed much distress and concern at the loss of the money .
christie	ackroyd	“ i don ’ t think there ’ s anything wrong with her , ” observed the inspector , after he had dismissed her . “ what about parker ? ” miss russell pursed her lips together and made no reply . “ i ’ ve a feeling there ’ s something wrong about that man , ” the inspector continued thoughtfully . “ the trouble is that i don ’ t quite see when he got his opportunity . he ’ d be busy with his duties immediately after dinner , and he ’ s got a pretty good alibi all through the evening . i know , for i ’ ve been devoting particular attention to it . well , thank you very much , miss russell . we ’ ll leave things as they are for the present . it ’ s highly probable mr. ackroyd paid that money away himself . ”
christie	ackroyd	the housekeeper bade us a dry good-afternoon , and we took our leave . i left the house with poirot . “ i wonder , ” i said , breaking the silence , “ what the papers the girl disarranged could have been for ackroyd to have got into such a state about them ? i wonder if there is any clew there to the mystery . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ the secretary said there were no papers of particular importance on the desk , ” said poirot quietly . “ yes , but—— ” i paused . “ it strikes you as odd that ackroyd should have flown into a rage about so trivial a matter ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ yes , it does rather. ” “ but was it a trivial matter ? ” “ of course , ” i admitted , “ we don ’ t know what those papers may have been . but raymond certainly said—— ” “ leave m. raymond out of it for a minute . what did you think of that girl ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ which girl ? the parlormaid ? ” “ yes , the parlormaid . ursula bourne. ” “ she seemed a nice girl , ” i said hesitatingly . poirot repeated my words , but whereas i had laid a slight stress on the fourth word , he put it on the second .
christie	ackroyd	“ she _seemed_ a nice girl—yes. ” then , after a minute ’ s silence , he took something from his pocket and handed it to me . “ see , my friend , i will show you something . look there . ”
christie	ackroyd	the paper he had handed me was that compiled by the inspector and given by him to poirot that morning . following the pointing finger , i saw a small cross marked in pencil opposite the name ursula bourne .
christie	ackroyd	“ you may not have noticed it at the time , my good friend , but there was one person on this list whose alibi had no kind of confirmation . ursula bourne. ” “ you don ’ t think—— ”
christie	ackroyd	“ dr . sheppard , i dare to think anything . ursula bourne may have killed mr. ackroyd , but i confess i can see no motive for her doing so . can you ? ” he looked at me very hard—so hard that i felt uncomfortable .
christie	ackroyd	“ can you ? ” he repeated . “ no motive whatsoever , ” i said firmly . his gaze relaxed . he frowned and murmured to himself : — “ since the blackmailer was a man , it follows that she can not be the blackmailer , then—— ”
christie	ackroyd	i coughed . “ as far as that goes—— ” i began doubtfully . he spun round on me . “ what ? what are you going to say ? ” “ nothing . nothing . only that , strictly speaking , mrs. ferrars in her letter mentioned a _person_—she didn ’ t actually specify a man . but we took it for granted , ackroyd and i , that it _was_ a man . ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot did not seem to be listening to me . he was muttering to himself again . “ but then it is possible after all—yes , certainly it is possible—but then—ah ! i must rearrange my ideas . method , order ; never have i needed them more . everything must fit in—in its appointed place—otherwise i am on the wrong tack . ”
christie	ackroyd	he broke off , and whirled round upon me again . “ where is marby ? ” “ it ’ s on the other side of cranchester. ” “ how far away ? ” “ oh ! —fourteen miles , perhaps. ” “ would it be possible for you to go there ? to-morrow , say ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ to-morrow ? let me see , that ’ s sunday . yes , i could arrange it . what do you want me to do there ? ” “ see this mrs. folliott . find out all you can about ursula bourne . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ very well . but—i don ’ t much care for the job. ” “ it is not the time to make difficulties . a man ’ s life may hang on this. ” “ poor ralph , ” i said with a sigh . “ you believe him to be innocent , though ? ”
christie	ackroyd	poirot looked at me very gravely . “ do you want to know the truth ? ” “ of course. ” “ then you shall have it . my friend , everything points to the assumption that he is guilty . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ what ! ” i exclaimed . poirot nodded . “ yes , that stupid inspector—for he is stupid—has everything pointing his way . i seek for the truth—and the truth leads me every time to ralph paton . motive , opportunity , means . but i will leave no stone unturned . i promised mademoiselle flora . and she was very sure , that little one . but very sure indeed . ”
christie	ackroyd	chapter xi poirot pays a call i was slightly nervous when i rang the bell at marby grange the following afternoon . i wondered very much what poirot expected to find out . he had entrusted the job to me . why ? was it because , as in the case of questioning major blunt , he wished to remain in the background ? the wish , intelligible in the first case , seemed to me quite meaningless here .
christie	ackroyd	my meditations were interrupted by the advent of a smart parlormaid . yes , mrs. folliott was at home . i was ushered into a big drawing-room , and looked round me curiously as i waited for the mistress of the house . a large bare room , some good bits of old china , and some beautiful etchings , shabby covers and curtains . a lady ’ s room in every sense of the term .
christie	ackroyd	i turned from the inspection of a bartolozzi on the wall as mrs. folliott came into the room . she was a tall woman , with untidy brown hair , and a very winning smile .
christie	ackroyd	“ dr . sheppard , ” she said hesitatingly . “ that is my name , ” i replied . “ i must apologize for calling upon you like this , but i wanted some information about a parlormaid previously employed by you , ursula bourne . ”
christie	ackroyd	with the utterance of the name the smile vanished from her face , and all the cordiality froze out of her manner . she looked uncomfortable and ill at ease . “ ursula bourne ? ” she said hesitatingly .
christie	ackroyd	“ yes , ” i said . “ perhaps you don ’ t remember the name ? ” “ oh , yes , of course . i—i remember perfectly. ” “ she left you just over a year ago , i understand ? ” “ yes . yes , she did . that is quite right . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ and you were satisfied with her whilst she was with you ? how long was she with you , by the way ? ” “ oh ! a year or two—i can ’ t remember exactly how long . she—she is very capable . i ’ m sure you will find her quite satisfactory . i didn ’ t know she was leaving fernly . i hadn ’ t the least idea of it . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ can you tell me anything about her ? ” i asked . “ anything about her ? ” “ yes , where she comes from , who her people are—that sort of thing ? ” mrs. folliott ’ s face wore more than ever its frozen look .
christie	ackroyd	“ i don ’ t know at all. ” “ who was she with before she came to you ? ” “ i ’ m afraid i don ’ t remember. ” there was a spark of anger now underlying her nervousness . she flung up her head in a gesture that was vaguely familiar .
christie	ackroyd	“ is it really necessary to ask all these questions ? ” “ not at all , ” i said , with an air of surprise and a tinge of apology in my manner . “ i had no idea you would mind answering them . i am very sorry . ”
christie	ackroyd	her anger left her and she became confused again . “ oh ! i don ’ t mind answering them . i assure you i don ’ t . why should i ? it—it just seemed a little odd , you know . that ’ s all . a little odd . ”
christie	ackroyd	one advantage of being a medical practitioner is that you can usually tell when people are lying to you . i should have known from mrs. folliott ’ s manner , if from nothing else , that she did mind answering my questions—minded intensely . she was thoroughly uncomfortable and upset , and there was plainly some mystery in the background . i judged her to be a woman quite unused to deception of any kind , and consequently rendered acutely uneasy when forced to practice it . a child could have seen through her .
christie	ackroyd	but it was also clear that she had no intention of telling me anything further . whatever the mystery centering around ursula bourne might be , i was not going to learn it through mrs. folliott .
christie	ackroyd	defeated , i apologized once more for disturbing her , took my hat and departed . i went to see a couple of patients and arrived home about six o ’ clock . caroline was sitting beside the wreck of tea things . she had that look of suppressed exultation on her face which i know only too well . it is a sure sign with her , of either the getting or the giving of information . i wondered which it had been .
christie	ackroyd	“ i ’ ve had a very interesting afternoon , ” began caroline as i dropped into my own particular easy chair , and stretched out my feet to the inviting blaze in the fireplace . “ have you ? ” i asked . “ miss ganett drop in to tea ? ”
christie	ackroyd	miss ganett is one of the chief of our newsmongers . “ guess again , ” said caroline with intense complacency . i guessed several times , working slowly through all the members of caroline ’ s intelligence corps . my sister received each guess with a triumphant shake of the head . in the end she volunteered the information herself .
christie	ackroyd	“ m . poirot ! ” she said . “ now what do you think of that ? ” i thought a good many things of it , but i was careful not to say them to caroline . “ why did he come ? ” i asked .
christie	ackroyd	“ to see me , of course . he said that knowing my brother so well , he hoped he might be permitted to make the acquaintance of his charming sister—your charming sister , i ’ ve got mixed up , but you know what i mean . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ what did he talk about ? ” i asked . “ he told me a lot about himself and his cases . you know that prince paul of mauretania—the one who ’ s just married a dancer ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ yes ? ” “ i saw a most intriguing paragraph about her in society snippets the other day , hinting that she was really a russian grand duchess—one of the czar ’ s daughters who managed to escape from the bolsheviks . well , it seems that m. poirot solved a baffling murder mystery that threatened to involve them both . prince paul was beside himself with gratitude . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ did he give him an emerald tie pin the size of a plover ’ s egg ? ” i inquired sarcastically . “ he didn ’ t mention it . why ? ” “ nothing , ” i said . “ i thought it was always done . it is in detective fiction anyway . the super detective always has his rooms littered with rubies and pearls and emeralds from grateful royal clients . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ it ’ s very interesting to hear about these things from the inside , ” said my sister complacently . it would be—to caroline . i could not but admire the ingenuity of m. hercule poirot , who had selected unerringly the case of all others that would most appeal to an elderly maiden lady living in a small village .
christie	ackroyd	“ did he tell you if the dancer was really a grand duchess ? ” i inquired . “ he was not at liberty to speak , ” said caroline importantly . i wondered how far poirot had strained the truth in talking to caroline—probably not at all . he had conveyed his innuendoes by means of his eyebrows and his shoulders .
christie	ackroyd	“ and after all this , ” i remarked , “ i suppose you were ready to eat out of his hand. ” “ don ’ t be coarse , james . i don ’ t know where you get these vulgar expressions from . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ probably from my only link with the outside world—my patients . unfortunately my practice does not lie amongst royal princes and interesting russian émigrés. ” caroline pushed her spectacles up and looked at me .
christie	ackroyd	“ you seem very grumpy , james . it must be your liver . a blue pill , i think , to-night. ” to see me in my own home , you would never imagine that i was a doctor of medicine . caroline does the home prescribing both for herself and me .
christie	ackroyd	“ damn my liver , ” i said irritably . “ did you talk about the murder at all ? ” “ well , naturally , james . what else is there to talk about locally ? i was able to set m. poirot right upon several points . he was very grateful to me . he said i had the makings of a born detective in me—and a wonderful psychological insight into human nature . ”
christie	ackroyd	caroline was exactly like a cat that is full to overflowing with rich cream . she was positively purring . “ he talked a lot about the little gray cells of the brain , and of their functions . his own , he says , are of the first quality . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ he would say so , ” i remarked bitterly . “ modesty is certainly not his middle name. ” “ i wish you would not be so horribly american , james . he thought it very important that ralph should be found as soon as possible , and induced to come forward and give an account of himself . he says that his disappearance will produce a very unfortunate impression at the inquest . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ and what did you say to that ? ” “ i agreed with him , ” said caroline importantly . “ and i was able to tell him the way people were already talking about it. ” “ caroline , ” i said sharply , “ did you tell m. poirot what you overheard in the wood that day ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i did , ” said caroline complacently . i got up and began to walk about . “ you realize what you ’ re doing , i hope , ” i jerked out . “ you ’ re putting a halter round ralph paton ’ s neck as surely as you ’ re sitting in that chair . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ not at all , ” said caroline , quite unruffled . “ i was surprised _you_ hadn ’ t told him. ” “ i took very good care not to , ” i said . “ i ’ m fond of that boy. ” “ so am i. that ’ s why i say you ’ re talking nonsense . i don ’ t believe ralph did it , and so the truth can ’ t hurt him , and we ought to give m. poirot all the help we can . why , think , very likely ralph was out with that identical girl on the night of the murder , and if so , he ’ s got a perfect alibi . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ if he ’ s got a perfect alibi , ” i retorted , “ why doesn ’ t he come forward and say so ? ” “ might get the girl into trouble , ” said caroline sapiently . “ but if m. poirot gets hold of her , and puts it to her as her duty , she ’ ll come forward of her own accord and clear ralph . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ you seem to have invented a romantic fairy story of your own , ” i said . “ you read too many trashy novels , caroline . i ’ ve always told you so. ” i dropped into my chair again .
christie	ackroyd	“ did poirot ask you any more questions ? ” i inquired . “ only about the patients you had that morning. ” “ the patients ? ” i demanded , unbelievingly . “ yes , your surgery patients . how many and who they were ? ”
christie	ackroyd	“ do you mean to say you were able to tell him that ? ” i demanded . caroline is really amazing . “ why not ? ” asked my sister triumphantly . “ i can see the path up to the surgery door perfectly from this window . and i ’ ve got an excellent memory , james . much better than yours , let me tell you . ”
christie	ackroyd	“ i ’ m sure you have , ” i murmured mechanically . my sister went on , checking the names on her fingers . “ there was old mrs. bennett , and that boy from the farm with the bad finger , dolly grice to have a needle out of her finger ; that american steward off the liner . let me see—that ’ s four . yes , and old george evans with his ulcer . and lastly—— ”
christie	ackroyd	she paused significantly . “ well ? ” caroline brought out her climax triumphantly . she hissed in the most approved style—aided by the fortunate number of s ’ s at her disposal . “ _miss russell ! _ ” she sat back in her chair and looked at me meaningly , and when caroline looks at you meaningly , it is impossible to miss it .

christie	poirot	xi the case of the missing will poirot investigates poirot investigates i the adventure of “ the western star ” i was standing at the window of poirot ’ s rooms looking out idly on the street below .
christie	poirot	“ that ’ s queer , ” i ejaculated suddenly beneath my breath . “ what is , _mon ami_ ? ” asked poirot placidly , from the depths of his comfortable chair . “ deduce , poirot , from the following facts ! here is a young lady , richly dressed—fashionable hat , magnificent furs . she is coming along slowly , looking up at the houses as she goes . unknown to her , she is being shadowed by three men and a middle-aged woman . they have just been joined by an errand boy who points after the girl , gesticulating as he does so . what drama is this being played ? is the girl a crook , and are the shadowers detectives preparing to arrest her ? or are _they_ the scoundrels , and are they plotting to attack an innocent victim ? what does the great detective say ? ”
christie	poirot	“ the great detective , _mon ami_ , chooses , as ever , the simplest course . he rises to see for himself. ” and my friend joined me at the window . in a minute he gave vent to an amused chuckle .
christie	poirot	“ as usual , your facts are tinged with your incurable romanticism . that is miss mary marvell , the film star . she is being followed by a bevy of admirers who have recognized her . and , _en passant_ , my dear hastings , she is quite aware of the fact ! ”
christie	poirot	i laughed . “ so all is explained ! but you get no marks for that , poirot . it was a mere matter of recognition. ” “ _en vérité ! _ and how many times have you seen mary marvell on the screen , _mon cher_ ? ”
christie	poirot	i thought . “ about a dozen times perhaps. ” “ and i—once ! yet _i_ recognize her , and _you_ do not. ” “ she looks so different , ” i replied rather feebly . “ ah ! _sacré_ ! ” cried poirot . “ is it that you expect her to promenade herself in the streets of london in a cowboy hat , or with bare feet , and a bunch of curls , as an irish colleen ? always with you it is the non-essentials ! remember the case of the dancer , valerie saintclair . ”
christie	poirot	i shrugged my shoulders , slightly annoyed . “ but console yourself , _mon ami_ , ” said poirot , calming down . “ all can not be as hercule poirot ! i know it well. ” “ you really have the best opinion of yourself of anyone i ever knew ! ” i cried , divided between amusement and annoyance .
christie	poirot	“ what will you ? when one is unique , one knows it ! and others share that opinion—even , if i mistake not , miss mary marvell. ” “ what ? ” “ without doubt . she is coming here. ” “ how do you make that out ? ”
christie	poirot	“ very simply . this street , it is not aristocratic , _mon ami_ ! in it there is no fashionable doctor , no fashionable dentist—still less is there a fashionable milliner ! but there _is_ a fashionable detective . _oui_ , my friend , it is true—i am become the mode , the _dernier cri_ ! one says to another : ‘ _comment ? _ you have lost your gold pencil-case ? you must go to the little belgian . he is too marvellous ! every one goes ! _courez ! ’ _ and they arrive ! in flocks , _mon ami_ ! with problems of the most foolish ! ” a bell rang below . “ what did i tell you ? that is miss marvell . ”
christie	poirot	as usual , poirot was right . after a short interval , the american film star was ushered in , and we rose to our feet . mary marvell was undoubtedly one of the most popular actresses on the screen . she had only lately arrived in england in company with her husband , gregory b. rolf , also a film actor . their marriage had taken place about a year ago in the states and this was their first visit to england . they had been given a great reception . every one was prepared to go mad over mary marvell , her wonderful clothes , her furs , her jewels , above all one jewel , the great diamond which had been nicknamed , to match its owner , “ the western star. ” much , true and untrue , had been written about this famous stone which was reported to be insured for the enormous sum of fifty thousand pounds .
christie	poirot	all these details passed rapidly through my mind as i joined with poirot in greeting our fair client . miss marvell was small and slender , very fair and girlish-looking , with the wide innocent blue eyes of a child .
christie	poirot	poirot drew forward a chair for her , and she commenced talking at once . “ you will probably think me very foolish , monsieur poirot , but lord cronshaw was telling me last night how wonderfully you cleared up the mystery of his nephew ’ s death , and i felt that i just must have your advice . i dare say it ’ s only a silly hoax—gregory says so—but it ’ s just worrying me to death . ”
christie	poirot	she paused for breath . poirot beamed encouragement . “ proceed , madame . you comprehend , i am still in the dark. ” “ it ’ s these letters. ” miss marvell unclasped her handbag , and drew out three envelopes which she handed to poirot .
christie	poirot	the latter scrutinized them closely . “ cheap paper—the name and address carefully printed . let us see the inside. ” he drew out the enclosure . i had joined him , and was leaning over his shoulder . the writing consisted of a single sentence , carefully printed like the envelope . it ran as follows :
christie	poirot	“ the great diamond which is the left eye of the god must return whence it came. ” the second letter was couched in precisely the same terms , but the third was more explicit :
christie	poirot	“ you have been warned . you have not obeyed . now the diamond will be taken from you . at the full of the moon , the two diamonds which are the left and right eye of the god shall return . so it is written . ”
christie	poirot	“ the first letter i treated as a joke , ” explained miss marvell . “ when i got the second , i began to wonder . the third one came yesterday , and it seemed to me that , after all , the matter might be more serious than i had imagined . ”
christie	poirot	“ i see they did not come by post , these letters. ” “ no ; they were left by hand—by a _chinaman._ that is what frightens me. ” “ why ? ” “ because it was from a chink in san francisco that gregory bought the stone three years ago . ”
christie	poirot	“ i see , madame , that you believe the diamond referred to to be—— ” “ ‘ the western star , ’ ” finished miss marvell . “ that ’ s so . at the time , gregory remembers that there was some story attached to the stone , but the chink wasn ’ t handing out any information . gregory says he seemed just scared to death , and in a mortal hurry to get rid of the thing . he only asked about a tenth of its value . it was greg ’ s wedding present to me . ”
christie	poirot	poirot nodded thoughtfully . “ the story seems of an almost unbelievable romanticism . and yet—who knows ? i pray of you , hastings , hand me my little almanac. ” i complied . “ _voyons ! _ ” said poirot , turning the leaves .
christie	poirot	“ when is the date of the full moon ? ah , friday next . that is in three days ’ time . _eh bien_ , madame , you seek my advice—i give it to you . this _belle histoire_ may be a hoax—but it may not ! therefore i counsel you to place the diamond in my keeping until after friday next . then we can take what steps we please . ”
christie	poirot	a slight cloud passed over the actress ’ s face , and she replied constrainedly : “ i ’ m afraid that ’ s impossible. ” “ you have it with you—_hein_ ? ” poirot was watching her narrowly . the girl hesitated a moment , then slipped her hand into the bosom of her gown , drawing out a long thin chain . she leaned forward , unclosing her hand . in the palm , a stone of white fire , exquisitely set in platinum , lay and winked at us solemnly .
christie	poirot	poirot drew in his breath with a long hiss . “ _épatant ! _ ” he murmured . “ you permit , madame ? ” he took the jewel in his own hand and scrutinized it keenly , then restored it to her with a little bow . “ a magnificent stone—without a flaw . ah , _cent tonnerres ! _ and you carry it about with you , _comme ça_ ! ”
christie	poirot	“ no , no , i ’ m very careful really , monsieur poirot . as a rule it ’ s locked up in my jewel-case , and left in the hotel safe deposit . we ’ re staying at the _magnificent_ , you know . i just brought it along to-day for you to see . ”
christie	poirot	“ and you will leave it with me , _n ’ est-ce pas_ ? you will be advised by papa poirot ? ” “ well , you see , it ’ s this way , monsieur poirot . on friday we ’ re going down to yardly chase to spend a few days with lord and lady yardly . ”
christie	poirot	her words awoke a vague echo of remembrance in my mind . some gossip—what was it now ? a few years ago lord and lady yardly had paid a visit to the states , rumour had it that his lordship had rather gone the pace out there with the assistance of some lady friends—but surely there was something more , some gossip which coupled lady yardly ’ s name with that of a “ movie ” star in california—why ! it came to me in a flash—of course it was none other than gregory b. rolf .
christie	poirot	“ i ’ ll let you into a little secret , monsieur poirot , ” miss marvell was continuing . “ we ’ ve got a deal on with lord yardly . there ’ s some chance of our arranging to film a play down there in his ancestral pile . ”
christie	poirot	“ at yardly chase ? ” i cried , interested . “ why , it ’ s one of the show places of england. ” miss marvell nodded . “ i guess it ’ s the real old feudal stuff all right . but he wants a pretty stiff price , and of course i don ’ t know yet whether the deal will go through , but greg and i always like to combine business with pleasure . ”
christie	poirot	“ but—i demand pardon if i am dense , madame—surely it is possible to visit yardly chase without taking the diamond with you ? ” a shrewd , hard look came into miss marvell ’ s eyes which belied their childlike appearance . she looked suddenly a good deal older .
christie	poirot	“ i want to wear it down there. ” “ surely ” i said suddenly , “ there are some very famous jewels in the yardly collection , a large diamond amongst them ? ” “ that ’ s so , ” said miss marvell briefly .
christie	poirot	i heard poirot murmur beneath his breath : “ ah , _c ’ est comme ça_ ! ” then he said aloud , with his usual uncanny luck in hitting the bull ’ s-eye ( he dignifies it by the name of psychology ) : “ then you are without doubt already acquainted with lady yardly , or perhaps your husband is ? ”
christie	poirot	“ gregory knew her when she was out west three years ago , ” said miss marvell . she hesitated a moment , and then added abruptly : “ do either of you ever see _society gossip_ ? ”
christie	poirot	we both pleaded guilty rather shamefacedly . “ i ask because in this week ’ s number there is an article on famous jewels , and it ’ s really very curious—— ” she broke off . i rose , went to the table at the other side of the room and returned with the paper in question in my hand . she took it from me , found the article , and began to read aloud :
christie	poirot	“ . . . amongst other famous stones may be included the star of the east , a diamond in the possession of the yardly family . an ancestor of the present lord yardly brought it back with him from china , and a romantic story is said to attach to it . according to this , the stone was once the right eye of a temple god . another diamond , exactly similar in form and size , formed the left eye , and the story goes that this jewel , too , would in course of time be stolen . ‘ one eye shall go west , the other east , till they shall meet once more . then , in triumph shall they return to the god. ’ it is a curious coincidence that there is at the present time a stone corresponding closely in description with this one , and known as ‘ the star of the west , ’ or ‘ the western star. ’ it is the property of the celebrated film actress , miss mary marvell . a comparison of the two stones would be interesting . ”
christie	poirot	she stopped . “ _épatant ! _ ” murmured poirot . “ without doubt a romance of the first water. ” he turned to mary marvell . “ and you are not afraid , madame ? you have no superstitious terrors ? you do not fear to introduce these two siamese twins to each other lest a chinaman should appear and , hey presto ! whisk them both back to china ? ”
christie	poirot	his tone was mocking , but i fancied that an undercurrent of seriousness lay beneath it . “ i don ’ t believe that lady yardly ’ s diamond is anything like as good a stone as mine , ” said miss marvell . “ anyway , i ’ m going to see . ”
christie	poirot	what more poirot would have said i do not know , for at that moment the door flew open , and a splendid-looking man strode into the room . from his crisply curling black head , to the tips of his patent-leather boots , he was a hero fit for romance .
christie	poirot	“ i said i ’ d call round for you , mary , ” said gregory rolf , “ and here i am . well , what does monsieur poirot say to our little problem ? just one big hoax , same as i do ? ”
christie	poirot	poirot smiled up at the big actor . they made a ridiculous contrast . “ hoax or no hoax , mr. rolf , ” he said dryly , “ i have advised madame your wife not to take the jewel with her to yardly chase on friday . ”
christie	poirot	“ i ’ m with you there , sir . i ’ ve already said so to mary . but there ! she ’ s a woman through and through , and i guess she can ’ t bear to think of another woman outshining her in the jewel line . ”
christie	poirot	“ what nonsense , gregory ! ” said mary marvell sharply . but she flushed angrily . poirot shrugged his shoulders . “ madame , i have advised . i can do no more . _c ’ est fini_. ” he bowed them both to the door .
christie	poirot	“ ah ! _la la_ , ” he observed , returning . “ _histoire de femmes ! _ the good husband , he hit the nail on the head—_tout de même_ , he was not tactful ! assuredly not. ” i imparted to him my vague remembrances , and he nodded vigorously .
christie	poirot	“ so i thought . all the same , there is something curious underneath all this . with your permission , _mon ami_ , i will take the air . await my return , i beg of you . i shall not be long . ”
christie	poirot	i was half asleep in my chair when the landlady tapped on the door , and put her head in . “ it ’ s another lady to see mr. poirot , sir . i ’ ve told her he was out , but she says as how she ’ ll wait , seeing as she ’ s come up from the country . ”
christie	poirot	“ oh , show her in here , mrs. murchison . perhaps i can do something for her. ” in another moment the lady had been ushered in . my heart gave a leap as i recognized her . lady yardly ’ s portrait had figured too often in the society papers to allow her to remain unknown .
christie	poirot	“ do sit down , lady yardly , ” i said , drawing forward a chair . “ my friend poirot is out , but i know for a fact that he ’ ll be back very shortly. ” she thanked me and sat down . a very different type , this , from miss mary marvell . tall , dark , with flashing eyes , and a pale proud face—yet something wistful in the curves of the mouth .
christie	poirot	i felt a desire to rise to the occasion . why not ? in poirot ’ s presence i have frequently felt a difficulty—i do not appear at my best . and yet there is no doubt that i , too , possess the deductive sense in a marked degree . i leant forward on a sudden impulse .
christie	poirot	“ lady yardly , ” i said , “ i know why you have come here . you have received blackmailing letters about the diamond. ” there was no doubt as to my bolt having shot home . she stared at me open-mouthed , all colour banished from her cheeks .
christie	poirot	“ you know ? ” she gasped . “ how ? ” i smiled . “ by a perfectly logical process . if miss marvell has had warning letters—— ” “ miss marvell ? she has been here ? ” “ she has just left . as i was saying , if she , as the holder of one of the twin diamonds , has received a mysterious series of warnings , you , as the holder of the other stone , must necessarily have done the same . you see how simple it is ? i am right , then , you have received these strange communications also ? ”
christie	poirot	for a moment she hesitated , as though in doubt whether to trust me or not , then she bowed her head in assent with a little smile . “ that is so , ” she acknowledged .
christie	poirot	“ were yours , too , left by hand—by a chinaman ? ” “ no , they came by post ; but , tell me , has miss marvell undergone the same experience , then ? ” i recounted to her the events of the morning . she listened attentively .
christie	poirot	“ it all fits in . my letters are the duplicates of hers . it is true that they came by post , but there is a curious perfume impregnating them—something in the nature of joss-stick—that at once suggested the east to me . what does it all mean ? ”
christie	poirot	i shook my head . “ that is what we must find out . you have the letters with you ? we might learn something from the postmarks. ” “ unfortunately i destroyed them . you understand , at the time i regarded it as some foolish joke . can it be true that some chinese gang are really trying to recover the diamonds ? it seems too incredible . ”
christie	poirot	we went over the facts again and again , but could get no further towards the elucidation of the mystery . at last lady yardly rose . “ i really don ’ t think i need wait for monsieur poirot . you can tell him all this , can ’ t you ? thank you so much , mr.—— ”
christie	poirot	she hesitated , her hand outstretched . “ captain hastings. ” “ of course ! how stupid of me . you ’ re a friend of the cavendishes , aren ’ t you ? it was mary cavendish who sent me to monsieur poirot . ”
christie	poirot	when my friend returned , i enjoyed telling him the tale of what had occurred during his absence . he cross-questioned me rather sharply over the details of our conversation and i could read between the lines that he was not best pleased to have been absent . i also fancied that the dear old fellow was just the least inclined to be jealous . it had become rather a pose with him to consistently belittle my abilities , and i think he was chagrined at finding no loophole for criticism . i was secretly rather pleased with myself , though i tried to conceal the fact for fear of irritating him . in spite of his idiosyncrasies , i was deeply attached to my quaint little friend .
christie	poirot	“ _bien ! _ ” he said at length , with a curious look on his face . “ the plot develops . pass me , i pray you , that ‘ peerage ’ on the top shelf there. ” he turned the leaves . “ ah , here we are ! ‘ yardly . . . 10th viscount , served south african war ’ . . . _tout ça n ’ a pas d ’ importance_ . . . ‘ mar . 1907 hon . maude stopperton , fourth daughter of 3rd baron cotteril ’ . . . um , um , um , . . . ‘ has iss . two daughters , born 1908 , 1910. . . . clubs . . . residences. ’ . . . _voilà_ , that does not tell us much . but to-morrow morning we see this _milord_ ! ”
christie	poirot	“ what ? ” “ yes . i telegraphed to him. ” “ i thought you had washed your hands of the case ? ” “ i am not acting for miss marvell since she refuses to be guided by my advice . what i do now is for my own satisfaction—the satisfaction of hercule poirot ! decidedly , i must have a finger in this pie . ”
christie	poirot	“ and you calmly wire lord yardly to dash up to town just to suit your convenience . he won ’ t be pleased. ” “ _au contraire_ , if i preserve for him his family diamond , he ought to be very grateful . ”
christie	poirot	“ then you really think there is a chance of it being stolen ? ” i asked eagerly . “ almost a certainty , ” replied poirot placidly . “ everything points that way. ” “ but how—— ” poirot stopped my eager questions with an airy gesture of the hand .
christie	poirot	“ not now , i pray you . let us not confuse the mind . and observe that ‘ peerage ’ —how you have replaced him ! see you not that the tallest books go in the top shelf , the next tallest in the row beneath , and so on . thus we have order , _method_ , which , as i have often told you , hastings—— ”
christie	poirot	“ exactly , ” i said hastily , and put the offending volume in its proper place . • • • • • • •
christie	poirot	lord yardly turned out to be a cheery , loud-voiced sportsman with a rather red face , but with a good-humoured bonhomie about him that was distinctly attractive and made up for any lack of mentality .
christie	poirot	“ extraordinary business this , monsieur poirot . can ’ t make head or tail of it . seems my wife ’ s been getting odd kind of letters , and that this miss marvell ’ s had ’ em too . what does it all mean ? ”
christie	poirot	poirot handed him the copy of _society gossip_ . “ first , _milord_ , i would ask you if these facts are substantially correct ? ” the peer took it . his face darkened with anger as he read .
christie	poirot	“ damned nonsense ! ” he spluttered . “ there ’ s never been any romantic story attaching to the diamond . it came from india originally , i believe . i never heard of all this chinese god stuff . ”
christie	poirot	“ still , the stone _is_ known as ‘ the star of the east. ’ ” “ well , what if it is ? ” he demanded wrathfully . poirot smiled a little , but made no direct reply . “ what i would ask you to do , _milord_ , is to place yourself in my hands . if you do so unreservedly , i have great hopes of averting the catastrophe . ”
christie	poirot	“ then you think there ’ s actually something in these wild-cat tales ? ” “ will you do as i ask you ? ” “ of course i will , but—— ” “ _bien ! _ then permit that i ask you a few questions . this affair of yardly chase , is it , as you say , all fixed up between you and mr. rolf ? ”
christie	poirot	“ oh , he told you about it , did he ? no , there ’ s nothing settled. ” he hesitated , the brick-red colour of his face deepening . “ might as well get the thing straight . i ’ ve made rather an ass of myself in many ways , monsieur poirot—and i ’ m head over ears in debt—but i want to pull up . i ’ m fond of the kids , and i want to straighten things up , and be able to live on at the old place . gregory rolf is offering me big money—enough to set me on my feet again . i don ’ t want to do it—i hate the thought of all that crowd play-acting round the chase—but i may have to , unless—— ” he broke off .
christie	poirot	poirot eyed him keenly . “ you have , then , another string to your bow ? permit that i make a guess ? it is to sell the star of the east ? ” lord yardly nodded . “ that ’ s it . it ’ s been in the family for some generations , but it ’ s not entailed . still , it ’ s not the easiest thing in the world to find a purchaser . hoffberg , the hatton garden man , is on the look-out for a likely customer , but he ’ ll have to find one soon , or it ’ s a washout . ”
christie	poirot	“ one more question , _permettez_—lady yardly , which plan does she approve ? ” “ oh , she ’ s bitterly opposed to my selling the jewel . you know what women are . she ’ s all for this film stunt . ”
christie	poirot	“ i comprehend , ” said poirot . he remained a moment or so in thought , then rose briskly to his feet . “ you return to yardly chase at once ? _bien ! _ say no word to anyone—to _anyone_ mind—but expect us there this evening . we will arrive shortly after five . ”
christie	poirot	“ all right , but i don ’ t see—— ” “ _ça n ’ a pas d ’ importance_ , ” said poirot kindly . “ you will that i preserve for you your diamond , _n ’ est-ce pas_ ? ” “ yes , but—— ” “ then do as i say . ”
christie	poirot	a sadly bewildered nobleman left the room . • • • • • • • it was half-past five when we arrived at yardly chase , and followed the dignified butler to the old panelled hall with its fire of blazing logs . a pretty picture met our eyes : lady yardly and her two children , the mother ’ s proud dark head bent down over the two fair ones . lord yardly stood near , smiling down on them .
christie	poirot	“ monsieur poirot and captain hastings , ” announced the butler . lady yardly looked up with a start , her husband came forward uncertainly , his eyes seeking instruction from poirot . the little man was equal to the occasion .
christie	poirot	“ all my excuses ! it is that i investigate still this affair of miss marvell ’ s . she comes to you on friday , does she not ? i make a little tour first to make sure that all is secure . also i wanted to ask of lady yardly if she recollected at all the postmarks on the letters she received ? ”
christie	poirot	lady yardly shook her head regretfully . “ i ’ m afraid i don ’ t . it is stupid of me . but , you see , i never dreamt of taking them seriously. ” “ you ’ ll stay the night ? ” said lord yardly .
christie	poirot	“ oh , _milord_ , i fear to incommode you . we have left our bags at the inn. ” “ that ’ s all right. ” lord yardly had his cue . “ we ’ ll send down for them . no , no—no trouble , i assure you . ”
christie	poirot	poirot permitted himself to be persuaded , and sitting down by lady yardly , began to make friends with the children . in a short time they were all romping together , and had dragged me into the game .
christie	poirot	“ _vous êtes bonne mère_ , ” said poirot , with a gallant little bow , as the children were removed reluctantly by a stern nurse . lady yardly smoothed her ruffled hair . “ i adore them , ” she said with a little catch in her voice .
christie	poirot	“ and they you—with reason ! ” poirot bowed again . a dressing-gong sounded , and we rose to go up to our rooms . at that moment the butler entered with a telegram on a salver which he handed to lord yardly . the latter tore it open with a brief word of apology . as he read it he stiffened visibly .
christie	poirot	with an ejaculation , he handed it to his wife . then he glanced at my friend . “ just a minute , monsieur poirot . i feel you ought to know about this . it ’ s from hoffberg . he thinks he ’ s found a customer for the diamond—an american , sailing for the states to-morrow . they ’ re sending down a chap to-night to vet the stone . by jove , though , if this goes through—— ” words failed him .
christie	poirot	lady yardly had turned away . she still held the telegram in her hand . “ i wish you wouldn ’ t sell it , george , ” she said , in a low voice . “ it ’ s been in the family so long. ” she waited , as though for a reply , but when none came her face hardened . she shrugged her shoulders . “ i must go and dress . i suppose i had better display ‘ the goods. ’ ” she turned to poirot with a slight grimace . “ it ’ s one of the most hideous necklaces that was ever designed ! george has always promised to have the stones reset for me , but it ’ s never been done. ” she left the room .
christie	poirot	half an hour later , we three were assembled in the great drawing-room awaiting the lady . it was already a few minutes past the dinner hour . suddenly there was a low rustle , and lady yardly appeared framed in the doorway , a radiant figure in a long white shimmering dress . round the column of her neck was a rivulet of fire . she stood there with one hand just touching the necklace .
christie	poirot	“ behold the sacrifice , ” she said gaily . her ill-humour seemed to have vanished . “ wait while i turn the big light on and you shall feast your eyes on the ugliest necklace in england . ”
christie	poirot	the switches were just outside the door . as she stretched out her hand to them , the incredible thing happened . suddenly without any warning , every light was extinguished , the door banged , and from the other side of it came a long-drawn piercing woman ’ s scream .
christie	poirot	“ my god ! ” cried lord yardly . “ that was maude ’ s voice ! what has happened ? ” we rushed blindly for the door , cannoning into each other in the darkness . it was some minutes before we could find it . what a sight met our eyes ! lady yardly lay senseless on the marble floor , a crimson mark on her white throat where the necklace had been wrenched from her neck .
christie	poirot	as we bent over her , uncertain for the moment whether she were dead or alive , her eyelids opened . “ the chinaman , ” she whispered painfully . “ the chinaman—the side door. ” lord yardly sprang up with an oath . i accompanied him , my heart beating wildly . the chinaman again ! the side door in question was a small one in the angle of the wall , not more than a dozen yards from the scene of the tragedy . as we reached it , i gave a cry . there , just short of the threshold , lay the glittering necklace , evidently dropped by the thief in the panic of his flight . i swooped joyously down on it . then i uttered another cry which lord yardly echoed . for in the middle of the necklace was a great gap . the star of the east was missing !
christie	poirot	“ that settles it , ” i breathed . “ these were no ordinary thieves . this one stone was all they wanted. ” “ but how did the fellow get in ? ” “ through this door. ” “ but it ’ s always locked . ”
christie	poirot	i shook my head . “ it ’ s not locked now . see. ” i pulled it open as i spoke . as i did so something fluttered to the ground . i picked it up . it was a piece of silk , and the embroidery was unmistakable . it had been torn from a chinaman ’ s robe .
christie	poirot	“ in his haste it caught in the door , ” i explained . “ come , hurry . he can not have gone far as yet. ” but in vain we hunted and searched . in the pitch darkness of the night , the thief had found it easy to make his getaway . we returned reluctantly , and lord yardly sent off one of the footmen post-haste to fetch the police .
christie	poirot	lady yardly , aptly ministered to by poirot , who is as good as a woman in these matters , was sufficiently recovered to be able to tell her story . “ i was just going to turn on the other light , ” she said , “ when a man sprang on me from behind . he tore my necklace from my neck with such force that i fell headlong to the floor . as i fell i saw him disappearing through the side door . then i realized by the pig-tail and the embroidered robe that he was a chinaman. ” she stopped with a shudder .
christie	poirot	the butler reappeared . he spoke in a low voice to lord yardly . “ a gentleman from mr. hoffberg ’ s , m ’ lord . he says you expect him. ” “ good heavens ! ” cried the distracted nobleman . “ i must see him , i suppose . no , not here , mullings , in the library . ”
christie	poirot	i drew poirot aside . “ look here , my dear fellow , hadn ’ t we better get back to london ? ” “ you think so , hastings ? why ? ” “ well ” —i coughed delicately— “ things haven ’ t gone very well , have they ? i mean , you tell lord yardly to place himself in your hands and all will be well—and then the diamond vanishes from under your very nose ! ”
christie	poirot	“ true , ” said poirot , rather crestfallen . “ it was not one of my most striking triumphs. ” this way of describing events almost caused me to smile , but i stuck to my guns .
christie	poirot	“ so , having—pardon the expression—rather made a mess of things , don ’ t you think it would be more graceful to leave immediately ? ” “ and the dinner , the without doubt excellent dinner , that the _chef_ of lord yardly has prepared ? ”
christie	poirot	“ oh , what ’ s dinner ! ” i said impatiently . poirot held up his hands in horror . “ _mon dieu ! _ it is that in this country you treat the affairs gastronomic with a criminal indifference . ”
christie	poirot	“ there ’ s another reason why we should get back to london as soon as possible , ” i continued . “ what is that , my friend ? ” “ the other diamond , ” i said , lowering my voice . “ miss marvell ’ s . ”
christie	poirot	“ _eh bien_ , what of it ? ” “ don ’ t you see ? ” his unusual obtuseness annoyed me . what had happened to his usually keen wits ? “ they ’ ve got one , now they ’ ll go for the other . ”
christie	poirot	“ _tiens ! _ ” cried poirot , stepping back a pace and regarding me with admiration . “ but your brain marches to a marvel , my friend ! figure to yourself that for the moment i had not thought of that ! but there is plenty of time . the full of the moon , it is not until friday . ”
christie	poirot	i shook my head dubiously . the full of the moon theory left me entirely cold . i had my way with poirot , however , and we departed immediately , leaving behind us a note of explanation and apology for lord yardly .
christie	poirot	my idea was to go at once to the _magnificent_ , and relate to miss marvell what had occurred , but poirot vetoed the plan , and insisted that the morning would be time enough . i gave in rather grudgingly .
christie	poirot	in the morning poirot seemed strangely disinclined to stir out . i began to suspect that , having made a mistake to start with , he was singularly loath to proceed with the case . in answer to my persuasions , he pointed out , with admirable common sense , that as the details of the affair at yardly chase were already in the morning papers the rolfs would know quite as much as we could tell them . i gave way unwillingly .
christie	poirot	events proved my forebodings to be justified . about two o ’ clock , the telephone rang . poirot answered it . he listened for some moments , then with a brief “ _bien , j ’ y serai_ ” he rang off , and turned to me .
christie	poirot	“ what do you think , _mon ami_ ? ” he looked half ashamed , half excited . “ the diamond of miss marvell , it has been stolen. ” “ what ? ” i cried , springing up . “ and what about the ‘ full of the moon ’ now ? ” poirot hung his head . “ when did this happen ? ”
christie	poirot	“ this morning , i understand. ” i shook my head sadly . “ if only you had listened to me . you see i was right. ” “ it appears so , _mon ami_ , ” said poirot cautiously . “ appearances are deceptive , they say , but it certainly appears so . ”
christie	poirot	as we hurried in a taxi to the _magnificent_ , i puzzled out the true inwardness of the scheme . “ that ‘ full of the moon ’ idea was clever . the whole point of it was to get us to concentrate on the friday , and so be off our guard beforehand . it is a pity you did not realize that . ”
christie	poirot	“ _ma foi ! _ ” said poirot airily , his nonchalance quite restored after its brief eclipse . “ one can not think of everything ! ” i felt sorry for him . he did so hate failure of any kind .
christie	poirot	“ cheer up , ” i said consolingly . “ better luck next time. ” at the _magnificent_ , we were ushered at once into the manager ’ s office . gregory rolf was there with two men from scotland yard . a pale-faced clerk sat opposite them .
christie	poirot	rolf nodded to us as we entered . “ we ’ re getting to the bottom of it , ” he said . “ but it ’ s almost unbelievable . how the guy had the nerve i can ’ t think. ” a very few minutes sufficed to give us the facts . mr. rolf had gone out of the hotel at 11.15 . at 11.30 , a gentleman , so like him in appearance as to pass muster , entered the hotel and demanded the jewel-case from the safe deposit . he duly signed the receipt , remarking carelessly as he did so : “ looks a bit different from my ordinary one , but i hurt my hand getting out of the taxi. ” the clerk merely smiled and remarked that he saw very little difference . rolf laughed and said : “ well , don ’ t run me in as a crook this time , anyway . i ’ ve been getting threatening letters from a chinaman , and the worst of it is i look rather like a chink myself—it ’ s something about the eyes . ”
christie	poirot	“ i looked at him , ” said the clerk who was telling us this , “ and i saw at once what he meant . the eyes slanted up at the corners like an oriental ’ s . i ’ d never noticed it before . ”
christie	poirot	“ darn it all , man , ” roared gregory rolf , leaning forward , “ do you notice it now ? ” the man looked up at him and started . “ no , sir , ” he said . “ i can ’ t say i do. ” and indeed there was nothing even remotely oriental about the frank brown eyes that looked into ours .
christie	poirot	the scotland yard man grunted . “ bold customer . thought the eyes might be noticed , and took the bull by the horns to disarm suspicion . he must have watched you out of the hotel , sir , and nipped in as soon as you were well away . ”
christie	poirot	“ what about the jewel-case ? ” i asked . “ it was found in a corridor of the hotel . only one thing had been taken— ‘ the western star. ’ ” we stared at each other—the whole thing was so bizarre , so unreal .
christie	poirot	poirot hopped briskly to his feet . “ i have not been of much use , i fear , ” he said regretfully . “ is it permitted to see madame ? ” “ i guess she ’ s prostrated with the shock , ” explained rolf .
christie	poirot	“ then perhaps i might have a few words alone with you , monsieur ? ” “ certainly. ” in about five minutes poirot reappeared . “ now , my friend , ” he said gaily . “ to a post office . i have to send a telegram . ”
christie	poirot	“ who to ? ” “ lord yardly. ” he discounted further inquiries by slipping his arm through mine . “ come , come , _mon ami_ . i know all that you feel about this miserable business . i have not distinguished myself ! you , in my place , might have distinguished yourself ! _bien ! _ all is admitted . let us forget it and have lunch . ”
christie	poirot	it was about four o ’ clock when we entered poirot ’ s rooms . a figure rose from a chair by the window . it was lord yardly . he looked haggard and distraught . “ i got your wire and came up at once . look here , i ’ ve been round to hoffberg , and they know nothing about that man of theirs last night , or the wire either . do you think that—— ”
christie	poirot	poirot held up his hand . “ my excuses ! i sent that wire , and hired the gentleman in question. ” “ _you_—but why ? what ? ” the nobleman spluttered impotently . “ my little idea was to bring things to a head , ” explained poirot placidly .
christie	poirot	“ bring things to a head ! oh , my god ! ” cried lord yardly . “ and the ruse succeeded , ” said poirot cheerfully . “ therefore , _milord_ , i have much pleasure in returning you—this ! ” with a dramatic gesture he produced a glittering object . it was a great diamond .
christie	poirot	“ the star of the east , ” gasped lord yardly . “ but i don ’ t understand—— ” “ no ? ” said poirot . “ it makes no matter . believe me , it was necessary for the diamond to be stolen . i promised you that it should be preserved to you , and i have kept my word . you must permit me to keep my little secret . convey , i beg of you , the assurances of my deepest respect to lady yardly , and tell her how pleased i am to be able to restore her jewel to her . what _beau temps_ , is it not ? good day , _milord_ . ”
christie	poirot	and smiling and talking , the amazing little man conducted the bewildered nobleman to the door . he returned gently rubbing his hands . “ poirot , ” i said . “ am i quite demented ? ” “ no , _mon ami_ , but you are , as always , in a mental fog . ”
christie	poirot	“ how did you get the diamond. ” “ from mr. rolf. ” “ rolf ? ” “ _mais oui ! _ the warning letters , the chinaman , the article in _society gossip_ , all sprang from the ingenious brain of mr. rolf ! the two diamonds , supposed to be so miraculously alike—bah ! they did not exist . there was only _one_ diamond , my friend ! originally in the yardly collection , for three years it has been in the possession of mr. rolf . he stole it this morning with the assistance of a touch of grease paint at the corner of each eye ! ah , i must see him on the film , he is indeed an artist , _celui-là_ !
christie	poirot	“ but why should he steal his own diamond ? ” i asked , puzzled . “ for many reasons . to begin with , lady yardly was getting restive. ” “ lady yardly ? ” “ you comprehend she was left much alone in california . her husband was amusing himself elsewhere . mr. rolf was handsome , he had an air about him of romance . but _au fond_ , he is very business-like , _ce monsieur_ ! he made love to lady yardly , and then he blackmailed her . i taxed the lady with the truth the other night , and she admitted it . she swore that she had only been indiscreet , and i believe her . but , undoubtedly , rolf had letters of hers that could be twisted to bear a different interpretation . terrified by the threat of a divorce , and the prospect of being separated from her children , she agreed to all he wished . she had no money of her own , and she was forced to permit him to substitute a paste replica for the real stone . the coincidence of the date of the appearance of ‘ the western star ’ struck me at once . all goes well . lord yardly prepares to range himself—to settle down . and then comes the menace of the possible sale of the diamond . the substitution will be discovered . without doubt she writes off frantically to gregory rolf who has just arrived in england . he soothes her by promising to arrange all—and prepares for a double robbery . in this way he will quiet the lady , who might conceivably tell all to her husband , an affair which would not suit our blackmailer at all , he will have £50,000 insurance money ( aha , you had forgotten that ! ) , and he will still have the diamond ! at this point i put my finger in the pie . the arrival of a diamond expert is announced . lady yardly , as i felt sure she would , immediately arranges a robbery—and does it very well too ! but hercule poirot , he sees nothing but facts . what happens in actuality ? the lady switches off the light , bangs the door , throws the necklace down the passage , and screams . she has already wrenched out the diamond with pliers upstairs—— ”
christie	poirot	“ but we saw the necklace round her neck ! ” i objected . “ i demand pardon , my friend . her hand concealed the part of it where the gap would have shown . to place a piece of silk in the door beforehand is child ’ s play ! of course , as soon as rolf read of the robbery , he arranged his own little comedy . and very well he played it ! ”
christie	poirot	“ what did you say to him ? ” i asked with lively curiosity . “ i said to him that lady yardly had told her husband all , that i was empowered to recover the jewel , and that if it were not immediately handed over proceedings would be taken . also a few more little lies which occurred to me . he was as wax in my hands ! ”
christie	poirot	i pondered the matter . “ it seems a little unfair on mary marvell . she has lost her diamond through no fault of her own. ” “ bah ! ” said poirot brutally . “ she has a magnificent advertisement . that is all she cares for , that one ! now the other , she is different . _bonne mère , très femme ! _ ”
christie	poirot	“ yes , ” i said doubtfully , hardly sharing poirot ’ s views on femininity . “ i suppose it was rolf who sent her the duplicate letters. ” “ _pas du tout_ , ” said poirot briskly . “ she came by the advice of mary cavendish to seek my aid in her dilemma . then she heard that mary marvell , whom she knew to be her enemy , had been here , and she changed her mind , jumping at a pretext that _you_ , my friend , offered her . a very few questions sufficed to show me that _you_ told her of the letters , not she you ! she jumped at the chance your words offered . ”
christie	poirot	“ i don ’ t believe it , ” i cried , stung . “ _si , si , mon ami_ , it is a pity that you study not the psychology . she told you that the letters were destroyed ? oh , la la , _never_ does a woman destroy a letter if she can avoid it ! not even if it would be more prudent to do so ! ”
christie	poirot	“ it ’ s all very well , ” i said , my anger rising , “ but you ’ ve made a perfect fool of me ! from beginning to end ! no , it ’ s all very well to try and explain it away afterwards . there really is a limit ! ”
christie	poirot	“ but you were so enjoying yourself , my friend . i had not the heart to shatter your illusions. ” “ it ’ s no good . you ’ ve gone a bit too far this time. ” “ _mon dieu ! _ but how you enrage yourself for nothing , _mon ami_ ! ”
christie	poirot	“ i ’ m fed up ! ” i went out , banging the door . poirot had made an absolute laughing-stock of me . i decided that he needed a sharp lesson . i would let some time elapse before i forgave him . he had encouraged me to make a perfect fool of myself !
christie	poirot	ii the tragedy at marsdon manor i had been called away from town for a few days , and on my return found poirot in the act of strapping up his small valise .
christie	poirot	“ _a la bonne heure_ , hastings . i feared you would not have returned in time to accompany me. ” “ you are called away on a case , then ? ” “ yes , though i am bound to admit that , on the face of it , the affair does not seem promising . the northern union insurance company have asked me to investigate the death of a mr. maltravers who a few weeks ago insured his life with them for the large sum of fifty thousand pounds . ”
christie	poirot	“ yes ? ” i said , much interested . “ there was , of course , the usual suicide clause in the policy . in the event of his committing suicide within a year the premiums would be forfeited . mr. maltravers was duly examined by the company ’ s own doctor , and although he was a man slightly past the prime of life was passed as being in quite sound health . however , on wednesday last—the day before yesterday—the body of mr. maltravers was found in the grounds of his house in essex , marsdon manor , and the cause of his death is described as some kind of internal hæmorrhage . that in itself would be nothing remarkable , but sinister rumours as to mr. maltravers ’ financial position have been in the air of late , and the northern union have ascertained beyond any possible doubt that the deceased gentleman stood upon the verge of bankruptcy . now that alters matters considerably . maltravers had a beautiful young wife , and it is suggested that he got together all the ready money he could for the purpose of paying the premiums on a life insurance for his wife ’ s benefit , and then committed suicide . such a thing is not uncommon . in any case , my friend alfred wright , who is a director of the northern union , has asked me to investigate the facts of the case , but , as i told him , i am not very hopeful of success . if the cause of the death had been heart failure , i should have been more sanguine . heart failure may always be translated as the inability of the local g.p . to discover what his patient really did die of , but a hæmorrhage seems fairly definite . still , we can but make some necessary inquiries . five minutes to pack your bag , hastings , and we will take a taxi to liverpool street . ”
christie	poirot	about an hour later , we alighted from a great eastern train at the little station of marsdon leigh . inquiries at the station yielded the information that marsdon manor was about a mile distant . poirot decided to walk , and we betook ourselves along the main street .
christie	poirot	“ what is our plan of campaign ? ” i asked . “ first i will call upon the doctor . i have ascertained that there is only one doctor in marsdon leigh , dr. ralph bernard . ah , here we are at his house . ”
christie	poirot	the house in question was a kind of superior cottage , standing back a little from the road . a brass plate on the gate bore the doctor ’ s name . we passed up the path and rang the bell .
christie	poirot	we proved to be fortunate in our call . it was the doctor ’ s consulting hour , and for the moment there were no patients waiting for him . dr. bernard was an elderly man , high-shouldered and stooping , with a pleasant vagueness of manner .
christie	poirot	poirot introduced himself and explained the purpose of our visit , adding that insurance companies were bound to investigate fully in a case of this kind . “ of course , of course , ” said dr. bernard vaguely . “ i suppose , as he was such a rich man , his life was insured for a big sum ? ”
christie	poirot	“ you consider him a rich man , doctor ? ” the doctor looked rather surprised . “ was he not ? he kept two cars , you know , and marsdon manor is a pretty big place to keep up , although i believe he bought it very cheap . ”
christie	poirot	“ i understand that he had had considerable losses of late , ” said poirot , watching the doctor narrowly . the latter , however , merely shook his head sadly . “ is that so ? indeed . it is fortunate for his wife , then , that there is this life insurance . a very beautiful and charming young creature , but terribly unstrung by this sad catastrophe . a mass of nerves , poor thing . i have tried to spare her all i can , but of course the shock was bound to be considerable . ”
christie	poirot	“ you had been attending mr. maltravers recently ? ” “ my dear sir , i never attended him. ” “ what ? ” “ i understand mr. maltravers was a christian scientist—or something of that kind. ” “ but you examined the body ? ”
christie	poirot	“ certainly . i was fetched by one of the under-gardeners. ” “ and the cause of death was clear ? ” “ absolutely . there was blood on the lips , but most of the bleeding must have been internal . ”
christie	poirot	“ was he still lying where he had been found ? ” “ yes , the body had not been touched . he was lying at the edge of a small plantation . he had evidently been out shooting rooks , a small rook rifle lay beside him . the hæmorrhage must have occurred quite suddenly . gastric ulcer , without a doubt . ”
christie	poirot	“ no question of his having been shot , eh ? ” “ my dear sir ! ” “ i demand pardon , ” said poirot humbly . “ but , if my memory is not at fault , in the case of a recent murder , the doctor first gave a verdict of heart failure—altering it when the local constable pointed out that there was a bullet wound through the head ! ”
christie	poirot	“ you will not find any bullet wounds on the body of mr. maltravers , ” said dr. bernard dryly . “ now , gentlemen , if there is nothing further—— ” we took the hint . “ good morning , and many thanks to you , doctor , for so kindly answering our questions . by the way , you saw no need for an autopsy ? ”
christie	poirot	“ certainly not. ” the doctor became quite apoplectic . “ the cause of death was clear , and in my profession we see no need to distress unduly the relatives of a dead patient . ”
christie	poirot	and , turning , the doctor slammed the door sharply in our faces . “ and what do you think of dr. bernard , hastings ? ” inquired poirot , as we proceeded on our way to the manor .
christie	poirot	“ rather an old ass. ” “ exactly . your judgments of character are always profound , my friend. ” i glanced at him uneasily , but he seemed perfectly serious . a twinkle , however , came into his eye , and he added slyly :
christie	poirot	“ that is to say , when there is no question of a beautiful woman ! ” i looked at him coldly . on our arrival at the manor-house , the door was opened to us by a middle-aged parlourmaid . poirot handed her his card , and a letter from the insurance company for mrs. maltravers . she showed us into a small morning-room , and retired to tell her mistress . about ten minutes elapsed , and then the door opened , and a slender figure in widow ’ s weeds stood upon the threshold .
christie	poirot	“ monsieur poirot ? ” she faltered . “ madame ! ” poirot sprang gallantly to his feet and hastened towards her . “ i can not tell you how i regret to derange you in this way . but what will you ? _les affaires_—they know no mercy . ”
christie	poirot	mrs. maltravers permitted him to lead her to a chair . her eyes were red with weeping , but the temporary disfigurement could not conceal her extraordinary beauty . she was about twenty-seven or eight , and very fair , with large blue eyes and a pretty pouting mouth .
christie	poirot	“ it is something about my husband ’ s insurance , is it ? but must i be bothered _now_—so soon ? ” “ courage , my dear madame . courage ! you see , your late husband insured his life for rather a large sum , and in such a case the company always has to satisfy itself as to a few details . they have empowered me to act for them . you can rest assured that i will do all in my power to render the matter not too unpleasant for you . will you recount to me briefly the sad events of wednesday ? ”
christie	poirot	“ i was changing for tea when my maid came up—one of the gardeners had just run to the house . he had found—— ” her voice trailed away . poirot pressed her hand sympathetically .
christie	poirot	“ i comprehend . enough ! you had seen your husband earlier in the afternoon ? ” “ not since lunch . i had walked down to the village for some stamps , and i believe he was out pottering round the grounds . ”
christie	poirot	“ shooting rooks , eh ? ” “ yes , he usually took his little rook rifle with him , and i heard one or two shots in the distance. ” “ where is this little rook rifle now ? ”
christie	poirot	“ in the hall , i think. ” she led the way out of the room and found and handed the little weapon to poirot , who examined it cursorily . “ two shots fired , i see , ” he observed , as he handed it back . “ and now , madame , if i might see—— ”
christie	poirot	he paused delicately . “ the servant shall take you , ” she murmured , averting her head . the parlourmaid , summoned , led poirot upstairs . i remained with the lovely and unfortunate woman . it was hard to know whether to speak or remain silent . i essayed one or two general reflections to which she responded absently , and in a very few minutes poirot rejoined us .
christie	poirot	“ i thank you for all your courtesy , madame . i do not think you need be troubled any further with this matter . by the way , do you know anything of your husband ’ s financial position ? ”
christie	poirot	she shook her head . “ nothing whatever . i am very stupid over business things. ” “ i see . then you can give us no clue as to why he suddenly decided to insure his life ? he had not done so previously , i understand . ”
christie	poirot	“ well , we had only been married a little over a year . but , as to why he insured his life , it was because he had absolutely made up his mind that he would not live long . he had a strong premonition of his own death . i gather that he had had one hæmorrhage already , and that he knew that another one would prove fatal . i tried to dispel these gloomy fears of his , but without avail . alas , he was only too right ! ”
christie	poirot	tears in her eyes , she bade us a dignified farewell . poirot made a characteristic gesture as we walked down the drive together . “ _eh bien_ , that is that ! back to london , my friend , there appears to be no mouse in this mouse-hole . and yet—— ”
christie	poirot	“ yet what ? ” “ a slight discrepancy , that is all ! you noticed it ? you did not ? still , life is full of discrepancies , and assuredly the man can not have taken his own life—there is no poison that would fill his mouth with blood . no , no , i must resign myself to the fact that all here is clear and above-board—but who is this ? ”
christie	poirot	a tall young man was striding up the drive towards us . he passed us without making any sign , but i noted that he was not ill-looking , with a lean , deeply bronzed face that spoke of life in a tropic clime . a gardener who was sweeping up leaves had paused for a minute in his task , and poirot ran quickly up to him .
christie	poirot	“ tell me , i pray you , who is that gentleman ? do you know him ? ” “ i don ’ t remember his name , sir , though i did hear it . he was staying down here last week for a night . tuesday , it was . ”
christie	poirot	“ quick , _mon ami_ , let us follow him. ” we hastened up the drive after the retreating figure . a glimpse of a black-robed figure on the terrace at the side of the house , and our quarry swerved and we after him , so that we were witnesses of the meeting .
christie	poirot	mrs. maltravers almost staggered where she stood , and her face blanched noticeably . “ you , ” she gasped . “ i thought you were on the sea—on your way to east africa ? ” “ i got some news from my lawyers that detained me , ” explained the young man . “ my old uncle in scotland died unexpectedly and left me some money . under the circumstances i thought it better to cancel my passage . then i saw this bad news in the paper and i came down to see if there was anything i could do . you ’ ll want some one to look after things for you a bit perhaps . ”
christie	poirot	at that moment they became aware of our presence . poirot stepped forward , and with many apologies explained that he had left his stick in the hall . rather reluctantly , it seemed to me , mrs. maltravers made the necessary introduction .
christie	poirot	“ monsieur poirot , captain black. ” a few minutes ’ chat ensued , in the course of which poirot elicited the fact that captain black was putting up at the anchor inn . the missing stick not having been discovered ( which was not surprising ) , poirot uttered more apologies and we withdrew .
christie	poirot	we returned to the village at a great pace , and poirot made a bee line for the anchor inn . “ here we establish ourselves until our friend the captain returns , ” he explained . “ you notice that i emphasized the point that we were returning to london by the first train ? possibly you thought i meant it . but no—you observed mrs. maltravers ’ face when she caught sight of this young black ? she was clearly taken aback , and he—_eh bien_ , he was very devoted , did you not think so ? and he was here on tuesday night—the day before mr. maltravers died . we must investigate the doings of captain black , hastings . ”
christie	poirot	in about half an hour we espied our quarry approaching the inn . poirot went out and accosted him and presently brought him up to the room we had engaged . “ i have been telling captain black of the mission which brings us here , ” he explained . “ you can understand , _monsieur le capitaine_ , that i am anxious to arrive at mr. maltravers ’ state of mind immediately before his death , and that at the same time i do not wish to distress mrs. maltravers unduly by asking her painful questions . now , you were here just before the occurrence , and can give us equally valuable information . ”
christie	poirot	“ i ’ ll do anything i can to help you , i ’ m sure , ” replied the young soldier ; “ but i ’ m afraid i didn ’ t notice anything out of the ordinary . you see , although maltravers was an old friend of my people ’ s , i didn ’ t know him very well myself . ”
christie	poirot	“ you came down—when ? ” “ tuesday afternoon . i went up to town early wednesday morning , as my boat sailed from tilbury about twelve o ’ clock . but some news i got made me alter my plans , as i dare say you heard me explain to mrs. maltravers . ”
christie	poirot	“ you were returning to east africa , i understand ? ” “ yes . i ’ ve been out there ever since the war—a great country. ” “ exactly . now what was the talk about at dinner on tuesday night ? ”
christie	poirot	“ oh , i don ’ t know . the usual odd topics . maltravers asked after my people , and then we discussed the question of german reparations , and then mrs. maltravers asked a lot of questions about east africa , and i told them one or two yarns , that ’ s about all , i think . ”
christie	poirot	“ thank you. ” poirot was silent for a moment , then he said gently : “ with your permission , i should like to try a little experiment . you have told us all that your conscious self knows , i want now to question your subconscious self . ”
christie	poirot	“ psychoanalysis , what ? ” said black , with visible alarm . “ oh , no , ” said poirot reassuringly . “ you see , it is like this , i give you a word , you answer with another , and so on . any word , the first one you think of . shall we begin ? ”
christie	poirot	“ all right , ” said black slowly , but he looked uneasy . “ note down the words , please , hastings , ” said poirot . then he took from his pocket his big turnip-faced watch and laid it on the table beside him . “ we will commence . day . ”
christie	poirot	there was a moment ’ s pause , and then black replied : “ _night_. ” as poirot proceeded , his answers came quicker . “ name , ” said poirot . “ _place_. ” “ bernard. ” “ _shaw_. ” “ tuesday. ” “ _dinner_. ” “ journey. ” “ _ship_. ” “ country. ” “ _uganda_. ” “ story . ”
christie	poirot	“ _lions_. ” “ rook rifle. ” “ _farm_. ” “ shot. ” “ _suicide_. ” “ elephant. ” “ _tusks_. ” “ money. ” “ _lawyers_. ” “ thank you , captain black . perhaps you could spare me a few minutes in about half an hour ’ s time ? ” “ certainly. ” the young soldier looked at him curiously and wiped his brow as he got up .
christie	poirot	“ and now , hastings , ” said poirot , smiling at me as the door closed behind him . “ you see it all , do you not ? ” “ i don ’ t know what you mean. ” “ does that list of words tell you nothing ? ”
christie	poirot	i scrutinized it , but was forced to shake my head . “ i will assist you . to begin with , black answered well within the normal time limit , with no pauses , so we can take it that he himself has no guilty knowledge to conceal . ‘ day ’ to ‘ night ’ and ‘ place ’ to ‘ name ’ are normal associations . i began work with ‘ bernard ’ which might have suggested the local doctor had he come across him at all . evidently he had not . after our recent conversation , he gave ‘ dinner ’ to my ‘ tuesday , ’ but ‘ journey ’ and ‘ country ’ were answered by ‘ ship ’ and ‘ uganda , ’ showing clearly that it was his journey abroad that was important to him and not the one which brought him down here . ‘ story ’ recalls to him one of the ‘ lion ’ stories he told at dinner . i proceed to ‘ rook rifle ’ and he answered with the totally unexpected word ‘ farm. ’ when i say ‘ shot , ’ he answers at once ‘ suicide. ’ the association seems clear . a man he knows committed suicide with a rook rifle on a farm somewhere . remember , too , that his mind is still on the stories he told at dinner , and i think you will agree that i shall not be far from the truth if i recall captain black and ask him to repeat the particular suicide story which he told at the dinner-table on tuesday evening . ”
christie	poirot	black was straightforward enough over the matter . “ yes , i did tell them that story now that i come to think of it . chap shot himself on a farm out there . did it with a rook rifle through the roof of the mouth , bullet lodged in the brain . doctors were no end puzzled over it—there was nothing to show except a little blood on the lips . but what—— ”
christie	poirot	“ what has it got to do with mr. maltravers ? you did not know , i see , that he was found with a rook rifle by his side. ” “ you mean my story suggested to him—oh , but that is awful ! ”
christie	poirot	“ do not distress yourself—it would have been one way or another . well , i must get on the telephone to london. ” poirot had a lengthy conversation over the wire , and came back thoughtful . he went off by himself in the afternoon , and it was not till seven o ’ clock that he announced that he could put it off no longer , but must break the news to the young widow . my sympathy had already gone out to her unreservedly . to be left penniless , and with the knowledge that her husband had killed himself to assure her future was a hard burden for any woman to bear . i cherished a secret hope , however , that young black might prove capable of consoling her after her first grief had passed . he evidently admired her enormously .
christie	poirot	our interview with the lady was painful . she refused vehemently to believe the facts that poirot advanced , and when she was at last convinced broke down into bitter weeping . an examination of the body turned our suspicions into certainty . poirot was very sorry for the poor lady , but , after all , he was employed by the insurance company , and what could he do ? as he was preparing to leave he said gently to mrs. maltravers :
christie	poirot	“ madame , you of all people should know that there are no dead ! ” “ what do you mean ? ” she faltered , her eyes growing wide . “ have you never taken part in any spiritualistic séances ? you are mediumistic , you know . ”
christie	poirot	“ i have been told so . but you do not believe in spiritualism , surely ? ” “ madame , i have seen some strange things . you know that they say in the village that this house is haunted ? ”
christie	poirot	she nodded , and at that moment the parlourmaid announced that dinner was ready . “ won ’ t you just stay and have something to eat ? ” we accepted gratefully , and i felt that our presence could not but help distract her a little from her own griefs .
christie	poirot	we had just finished our soup , when there was a scream outside the door , and the sound of breaking crockery . we jumped up . the parlourmaid appeared , her hand to her heart .
christie	poirot	“ it was a man—standing in the passage. ” poirot rushed out , returning quickly . “ there is no one there. ” “ isn ’ t there , sir ? ” said the parlourmaid weakly . “ oh , it did give me a start ! ”
christie	poirot	“ but why ? ” she dropped her voice to a whisper . “ i thought—i thought it was the master—it looked like ’ im. ” i saw mrs. maltravers give a terrified start , and my mind flew to the old superstition that a suicide can not rest . she thought of it too , i am sure , for a minute later , she caught poirot ’ s arm with a scream .
christie	poirot	“ didn ’ t you hear that ? those three taps on the window ? that ’ s how _he_ always used to tap when he passed round the house. ” “ the ivy , ” i cried . “ it was the ivy against the pane . ”
christie	poirot	but a sort of terror was gaining on us all . the parlourmaid was obviously unstrung , and when the meal was over mrs. maltravers besought poirot not to go at once . she was clearly terrified to be left alone . we sat in the little morning-room . the wind was getting up , and moaning round the house in an eerie fashion . twice the door of the room came unlatched and the door slowly opened , and each time she clung to me with a terrified gasp .
christie	poirot	“ ah , but this door , it is bewitched ! ” cried poirot angrily at last . he got up and shut it once more , then turned the key in the lock . “ i shall lock it , so ! ”
christie	poirot	“ don ’ t do that , ” she gasped , “ if it should come open now—— ” and even as she spoke the impossible happened . the locked door slowly swung open . i could not see into the passage from where i sat , but she and poirot were facing it . she gave one long shriek as she turned to him .
christie	poirot	“ you saw him—there in the passage ? ” she cried . he was staring down at her with a puzzled face , then shook his head . “ i saw him—my husband—you must have seen him too ? ”
christie	poirot	“ madame , i saw nothing . you are not well—unstrung—— ” “ i am perfectly well , i——oh , god ! ” suddenly , without any warning , the lights quivered and went out . out of the darkness came three loud raps . i could hear mrs. maltravers moaning .
christie	poirot	and then—i saw ! the man i had seen on the bed upstairs stood there facing us , gleaming with a faint ghostly light . there was blood on his lips , and he held his right hand out , pointing . suddenly a brilliant light seemed to proceed from it . it passed over poirot and me , and fell on mrs. maltravers . i saw her white terrified face , and something else !
christie	poirot	“ my god , poirot ! ” i cried . “ look at her hand , her right hand . it ’ s all red ! ” her own eyes fell on it , and she collapsed in a heap on the floor .
christie	poirot	“ blood , ” she cried hysterically . “ yes , it ’ s blood . i killed him . i did it . he was showing me , and then i put my hand on the trigger and pressed . save me from him—save me ! he ’ s come back ! ”
christie	poirot	her voice died away in a gurgle . “ lights , ” said poirot briskly . the lights went on as if by magic . “ that ’ s it , ” he continued . “ you heard , hastings ? and you , everett ? oh , by the way , this is mr. everett , rather a fine member of the theatrical profession . i ’ phoned to him this afternoon . his make-up is good , isn ’ t it ? quite like the dead man , and with a pocket torch and the necessary phosphorescence he made the proper impression . i shouldn ’ t touch her right hand if i were you , hastings . red paint marks so . when the lights went out i clasped her hand , you see . by the way , we mustn ’ t miss our train . inspector japp is outside the window . a bad night—but he has been able to while away the time by tapping on the window every now and then . ”
christie	poirot	“ you see , ” continued poirot , as we walked briskly through the wind and rain , “ there was a little discrepancy . the doctor seemed to think the deceased was a christian scientist , and who could have given him that impression but mrs. maltravers ? but to us she represented him as being in a grave state of apprehension about his own health . again , why was she so taken aback by the reappearance of young black ? and lastly , although i know that convention decrees that a woman must make a decent pretence of mourning for her husband , i do not care for such heavily-rouged eyelids ! you did not observe them , hastings ? no ? as i always tell you , you see nothing ! ”
christie	poirot	“ well , there it was . there were the two possibilities . did black ’ s story suggest an ingenious method of committing suicide to mr. maltravers , or did his other listener , the wife , see an equally ingenious method of committing murder ? i inclined to the latter view . to shoot himself in the way indicated , he would probably have had to pull the trigger with his toe—or at least so i imagine . now if maltravers had been found with one boot off , we should almost certainly have heard of it from some one . an odd detail like that would have been remembered .
christie	poirot	“ no , as i say , i inclined to the view that it was a case of murder , not suicide , but i realized that i had not a shadow of proof in support of my theory . hence the elaborate little comedy you saw played to-night . ”
christie	poirot	“ even now i don ’ t quite see all the details of the crime ? ” i said . “ let us start from the beginning . here is a shrewd and scheming woman who , knowing of her husband ’ s financial _débâcle_ and tired of the elderly mate she has only married for his money , induces him to insure his life for a large sum , and then seeks for the means to accomplish her purpose . an accident gives her that—the young soldier ’ s strange story . the next afternoon when _monsieur le capitaine_ , as she thinks , is on the high seas , she and her husband are strolling round the grounds . ‘ what a curious story that was last night ! ’ she observes . ‘ could a man shoot himself in such a way ? do show me if it is possible ! ’ the poor fool—he shows her . he places the end of the rifle in his mouth . she stoops down , and puts her finger on the trigger , laughing up at him . ‘ and now , sir , ’ she says saucily , ‘ supposing i pull the trigger ? ’
christie	poirot	“ and then—and then , hastings—she pulls it ! ” iii the adventure of the cheap flat so far , in the cases which i have recorded , poirot ’ s investigations have started from the central fact , whether murder or robbery , and have proceeded from thence by a process of logical deduction to the final triumphant unravelling . in the events i am now about to chronicle , a remarkable chain of circumstances led from the apparently trivial incidents which first attracted poirot ’ s attention to the sinister happenings which completed a most unusual case .
christie	poirot	i had been spending the evening with an old friend of mine , gerald parker . there had been , perhaps , about half a dozen people there besides my host and myself , and the talk fell , as it was bound to do sooner or later wherever parker found himself , on the subject of house-hunting in london . houses and flats were parker ’ s special hobby . since the end of the war , he had occupied at least half a dozen different flats and maisonnettes . no sooner was he settled anywhere than he would light unexpectedly upon a new find , and would forthwith depart bag and baggage . his moves were nearly always accomplished at a slight pecuniary gain , for he had a shrewd business head , but it was sheer love of the sport that actuated him , and not a desire to make money at it . we listened to parker for some time with the respect of the novice for the expert . then it was our turn , and a perfect babel of tongues was let loose . finally the floor was left to mrs. robinson , a charming little bride who was there with her husband . i had never met them before , as robinson was only a recent acquaintance of parker ’ s .
christie	poirot	“ talking of flats , ” she said , “ have you heard of our piece of luck , mr. parker ? we ’ ve got a flat—at last ! in montagu mansions. ” “ well , ” said parker , “ i ’ ve always said there are plenty of flats—at a price ! ”
christie	poirot	“ yes , but this isn ’ t at a price . it ’ s dirt cheap . eighty pounds a year ! ” “ but—but montagu mansions is just off knightsbridge , isn ’ t it ? big handsome building . or are you talking of a poor relation of the same name stuck in the slums somewhere ? ”
christie	poirot	“ no , it ’ s the knightsbridge one . that ’ s what makes it so wonderful. ” “ wonderful is the word ! it ’ s a blinking miracle . but there must be a catch somewhere . big premium , i suppose ? ”
christie	poirot	“ no premium ! ” “ no prem—oh , hold my head , somebody ! ” groaned parker . “ but we ’ ve got to buy the furniture , ” continued mrs. robinson . “ ah ! ” parker brisked up . “ i knew there was a catch ! ”
christie	poirot	“ for fifty pounds . and it ’ s beautifully furnished ! ” “ i give it up , ” said parker . “ the present occupants must be lunatics with a taste for philanthropy. ” mrs. robinson was looking a little troubled . a little pucker appeared between her dainty brows .
christie	poirot	“ it _is_ queer , isn ’ t it ? you don ’ t think that—that—the place is _haunted_ ? ” “ never heard of a haunted flat , ” declared parker decisively . “ n-o. ” mrs. robinson appeared far from convinced . “ but there were several things about it all that struck me as—well , queer . ”
christie	poirot	“ for instance—— ” i suggested . “ ah , ” said parker , “ our criminal expert ’ s attention is aroused ! unburden yourself to him , mrs. robinson . hastings is a great unraveller of mysteries. ” i laughed , embarrassed but not wholly displeased with the rôle thrust upon me .
christie	poirot	“ oh , not really queer , captain hastings , but when we went to the agents , stosser and paul—we hadn ’ t tried them before because they only have the expensive mayfair flats , but we thought at any rate it would do no harm—everything they offered us was four and five hundred a year , or else huge premiums , and then , just as we were going , they mentioned that they had a flat at eighty , but that they doubted if it would be any good our going there , because it had been on their books some time and they had sent so many people to see it that it was almost sure to be taken— ‘ snapped up ’ as the clerk put it—only people were so tiresome in not letting them know , and then they went on sending , and people get annoyed at being sent to a place that had , perhaps , been let some time . ”
christie	poirot	mrs. robinson paused for some much needed breath , and then continued : “ we thanked him , and said that we quite understood it would probably be no good , but that we should like an order all the same—just in case . and we went there straight away in a taxi , for , after all , you never know . no . 4 was on the second floor , and just as we were waiting for the lift , elsie ferguson—she ’ s a friend of mine , captain hastings , and they are looking for a flat too—came hurrying down the stairs . ‘ ahead of you for once , my dear , ’ she said . ‘ but it ’ s no good . it ’ s already let. ’ that seemed to finish it , but—well , as john said , the place was very cheap , we could afford to give more , and perhaps if we offered a premium.——a horrid thing to do , of course , and i feel quite ashamed of telling you , but you know what flat-hunting is . ”
christie	poirot	i assured her that i was well aware that in the struggle for house-room the baser side of human nature frequently triumphed over the higher , and that the well-known rule of dog eat dog always applied .
christie	poirot	“ so we went up and , would you believe it , the flat wasn ’ t let at all . we were shown over it by the maid , and then we saw the mistress , and the thing was settled then and there . immediate possession and fifty pounds for the furniture . we signed the agreement next day , and we are to move in to-morrow ! ” mrs. robinson paused triumphantly .
christie	poirot	“ and what about mrs. ferguson ? ” asked parker . “ let ’ s have your deductions , hastings. ” “ ‘ obvious , my dear watson , ’ ” i quoted lightly . “ she went to the wrong flat. ” “ oh , captain hastings , how clever of you ! ” cried mrs. robinson admiringly .
christie	poirot	i rather wished poirot had been there . sometimes i have the feeling that he rather underestimates my capabilities . • • • • • • •
christie	poirot	the whole thing was rather amusing , and i propounded the thing as a mock problem to poirot on the following morning . he seemed interested , and questioned me rather narrowly as to the rents of flats in various localities .
christie	poirot	“ a curious story , ” he said thoughtfully . “ excuse me , hastings , i must take a short stroll. ” when he returned , about an hour later , his eyes were gleaming with a peculiar excitement . he laid his stick on the table , and brushed the nap of his hat with his usual tender care before he spoke .
christie	poirot	“ it is as well , _mon ami_ , that we have no affairs of moment on hand . we can devote ourselves wholly to the present investigation. ” “ what investigation are you talking about ? ”
christie	poirot	“ the remarkable cheapness of your friend ’ s , mrs. robinson ’ s , new flat. ” “ poirot , you are not serious ! ” “ i am most serious . figure to yourself , my friend , that the real rent of those flats is £350 . i have just ascertained that from the landlord ’ s agents . and yet this particular flat is being sublet at eighty pounds ! why ? ”
christie	poirot	“ there must be something wrong with it . perhaps it is haunted , as mrs. robinson suggested. ” poirot shook his head in a dissatisfied manner . “ then again how curious it is that her friend tells her the flat is let , and , when she goes up , behold , it is not so at all ! ”
christie	poirot	“ but surely you agree with me that the other woman must have gone to the wrong flat . that is the only possible solution. ” “ you may or may not be right on that point , hastings . the fact still remains that numerous other applicants were sent to see it , and yet , in spite of its remarkable cheapness , it was still in the market when mrs. robinson arrived . ”
christie	poirot	“ that shows that there must be something wrong about it. ” “ mrs . robinson did not seem to notice anything amiss . very curious , is it not ? did she impress you as being a truthful woman , hastings ? ”
christie	poirot	“ she was a delightful creature ! ” “ _évidemment ! _ since she renders you incapable of replying to my question . describe her to me , then. ” “ well , she ’ s tall and fair ; her hair ’ s really a beautiful shade of auburn—— ”
christie	poirot	“ always you have had a penchant for auburn hair ! ” murmured poirot . “ but continue. ” “ blue eyes and a very nice complexion and—well , that ’ s all , i think , ” i concluded lamely . “ and her husband ? ”
christie	poirot	“ oh , he ’ s quite a nice fellow—nothing startling. ” “ dark or fair ? ” “ i don ’ t know—betwixt and between , and just an ordinary sort of face. ” poirot nodded . “ yes , there are hundreds of these average men—and , anyway , you bring more sympathy and appreciation to your description of women . do you know anything about these people ? does parker know them well . ”
christie	poirot	“ they are just recent acquaintances , i believe . but surely , poirot , you don ’ t think for an instant—— ” poirot raised his hand . “ _tout doucement , mon ami_ . have i said that i think anything ? all i say is—it is a curious story . and there is nothing to throw light upon it ; except perhaps the lady ’ s name , eh , hastings ? ”
christie	poirot	“ her name is stella , ” i said stiffly , “ but i don ’ t see—— ” poirot interrupted me with a tremendous chuckle . something seemed to be amusing him vastly . “ and stella means a star , does it not ? famous ! ”
christie	poirot	“ what on earth—— ” “ and stars give light ! _voilà ! _ calm yourself , hastings . do not put on that air of injured dignity . come , we will go to montagu mansions and make a few inquiries . ”
christie	poirot	i accompanied him , nothing loath . the mansions were a handsome block of buildings in excellent repair . a uniformed porter was sunning himself on the threshold , and it was to him that poirot addressed himself :
christie	poirot	“ pardon , but could you tell me if a mr. and mrs. robinson reside here ? ” the porter was a man of few words and apparently of a sour or suspicious disposition . he hardly looked at us and grunted out :
christie	poirot	“ no . 4 . second floor. ” “ i thank you . can you tell me how long they have been here ? ” “ six months. ” i started forward in amazement , conscious as i did so of poirot ’ s malicious grin .
christie	poirot	“ impossible , ” i cried . “ you must be making a mistake. ” “ six months. ” “ are you sure ? the lady i mean is tall and fair with reddish gold hair and—— ” “ that ’ s ’ er , ” said the porter . “ come in the michaelmas quarter , they did . just six months ago . ”
christie	poirot	he appeared to lose interest in us and retreated slowly up the hall . i followed poirot outside . “ _eh bien_ , hastings ? ” my friend demanded slyly . “ are you so sure now that delightful women always speak the truth ? ”
christie	poirot	i did not reply . poirot had steered his way into brompton road before i asked him what he was going to do and where we were going . “ to the house agents , hastings . i have a great desire to have a flat in montagu mansions . if i am not mistaken , several interesting things will take place there before long . ”
christie	poirot	we were fortunate in our quest . no . 8 , on the fourth floor , was to be let furnished at ten guineas a week . poirot promptly took it for a month . outside in the street again , he silenced my protests :
christie	poirot	“ but i make money nowadays ! why should i not indulge a whim ? by the way , hastings , have you a revolver ? ” “ yes—somewhere , ” i answered , slightly thrilled . “ do you think—— ” “ that you will need it ? it is quite possible . the idea pleases you , i see . always the spectacular and romantic appeals to you . ”
christie	poirot	the following day saw us installed in our temporary home . the flat was pleasantly furnished . it occupied the same position in the building as that of the robinsons , but was two floors higher .
christie	poirot	the day after our installation was a sunday . in the afternoon , poirot left the front door ajar , and summoned me hastily as a bang reverberated from somewhere below . “ look over the banisters . are those your friends . do not let them see you . ”
christie	poirot	i craned my neck over the staircase . “ that ’ s them , ” i declared in an ungrammatical whisper . “ good . wait awhile. ” about half an hour later , a young woman emerged in brilliant and varied clothing . with a sigh of satisfaction , poirot tiptoed back into the flat .
christie	poirot	“ _c ’ est ça_ . after the master and mistress , the maid . the flat should now be empty. ” “ what are we going to do ? ” i asked uneasily . poirot had trotted briskly into the scullery and was hauling at the rope of the coal-lift .
christie	poirot	“ we are about to descend after the method of the dustbins , ” he explained cheerfully . “ no one will observe us . the sunday concert , the sunday ‘ afternoon out , ’ and finally the sunday nap after the sunday dinner of england—_le rosbif_—all these will distract attention from the doings of hercule poirot . come , my friend . ”
christie	poirot	he stepped into the rough wooden contrivance and i followed him gingerly . “ are we going to break into the flat ? ” i asked dubiously . poirot ’ s answer was not too reassuring : “ not precisely to-day , ” he replied .
christie	poirot	pulling on the rope , we descended slowly till we reached the second floor . poirot uttered an exclamation of satisfaction as he perceived that the wooden door into the scullery was open .
christie	poirot	“ you observe ? never do they bolt these doors in the daytime . and yet anyone could mount or descend as we have done . at night yes—though not always then—and it is against that that we are going to make provision . ”
christie	poirot	he had drawn some tools from his pocket as he spoke , and at once set deftly to work , his object being to arrange the bolt so that it could be pulled back from the lift . the operation only occupied about three minutes . then poirot returned the tools to his pocket , and we reascended once more to our own domain .
christie	poirot	• • • • • • • on monday poirot was out all day , but when he returned in the evening he flung himself into his chair with a sigh of satisfaction .
christie	poirot	“ hastings , shall i recount to you a little history ? a story after your own heart and which will remind you of your favourite cinema ? ” “ go ahead , ” i laughed . “ i presume that it is a true story , not one of your efforts of fancy . ”
christie	poirot	“ it is true enough . inspector japp of scotland yard will vouch for its accuracy , since it was through his kind offices that it came to my ears . listen , hastings . a little over six months ago some important naval plans were stolen from an american government department . they showed the position of some of the most important harbour defences , and would be worth a considerable sum to any foreign government—that of japan , for example . suspicion fell upon a young man named luigi valdarno , an italian by birth , who was employed in a minor capacity in the department and who was missing at the same time as the papers . whether luigi valdarno was the thief or not , he was found two days later on the east side in new york , shot dead . the papers were not on him . now for some time past luigi valdarno had been going about with a miss elsa hardt , a young concert singer who had recently appeared and who lived with a brother in an apartment in washington . nothing was known of the antecedents of miss elsa hardt , and she disappeared suddenly about the time of valdarno ’ s death . there are reasons for believing that she was in reality an accomplished international spy who has done much nefarious work under various _aliases_ . the american secret service , whilst doing their best to trace her , also kept an eye upon certain insignificant japanese gentlemen living in washington . they felt pretty certain that , when elsa hardt had covered her tracks sufficiently , she would approach the gentlemen in question . one of them left suddenly for england a fortnight ago . on the face of it , therefore , it would seem that elsa hardt is in england. ” poirot paused , and then added softly : “ the official description of elsa hardt is : height 5 ft. 7 , eyes blue , hair auburn , fair complexion , nose straight , no special distinguishing marks . ”
christie	poirot	“ mrs . robinson ! ” i gasped . “ well , there is a chance of it , anyhow , ” amended poirot . “ also , i learn that a swarthy man , a foreigner of some kind , was inquiring about the occupants of no . 4 only this morning . therefore , _mon ami_ , i fear that you must forswear your beauty sleep to-night , and join me in my all-night vigil in the flat below—armed with that excellent revolver of yours , _bien entendu_ ! ”
christie	poirot	“ rather , ” i cried with enthusiasm . “ when shall we start ? ” “ the hour of midnight is both solemn and suitable , i fancy . nothing is likely to occur before then. ” at twelve o ’ clock precisely , we crept cautiously into the coal-lift and lowered ourselves to the second floor . under poirot ’ s manipulation , the wooden door quickly swung inwards , and we climbed into the flat . from the scullery we passed into the kitchen where we established ourselves comfortably in two chairs with the door into the hall ajar .
christie	poirot	“ now we have but to wait , ” said poirot contentedly , closing his eyes . to me , the waiting appeared endless . i was terrified of going to sleep . just when it seemed to me that i had been there about eight hours—and had , as i found out afterwards , in reality been exactly one hour and twenty minutes—a faint scratching sound came to my ears . poirot ’ s hand touched mine . i rose , and together we moved carefully in the direction of the hall . the noise came from there . poirot placed his lips to my ear .
christie	poirot	“ outside the front door . they are cutting out the lock . when i give the word , not before , fall upon him from behind and hold him fast . be careful , he will have a knife . ”
christie	poirot	presently there was a rending sound , and a little circle of light appeared through the door . it was extinguished immediately and then the door was slowly opened . poirot and i flattened ourselves against the wall . i heard a man ’ s breathing as he passed us . then he flashed on his torch , and as he did so , poirot hissed in my ear :
christie	poirot	“ _allez_. ” we sprang together , poirot with a quick movement enveloped the intruder ’ s head with a light woollen scarf whilst i pinioned his arms . the whole affair was quick and noiseless . i twisted a dagger from his hand , and as poirot brought down the scarf from his eyes , whilst keeping it wound tightly round his mouth , i jerked up my revolver where he could see it and understand that resistance was useless . as he ceased to struggle poirot put his mouth close to his ear and began to whisper rapidly . after a minute the man nodded . then enjoining silence with a movement of the hand , poirot led the way out of the flat and down the stairs . our captive followed , and i brought up the rear with the revolver . when we were out in the street , poirot turned to me .
christie	poirot	“ there is a taxi waiting just round the corner . give me the revolver . we shall not need it now. ” “ but if this fellow tries to escape ? ” poirot smiled . “ he will not . ”
christie	poirot	i returned in a minute with the waiting taxi . the scarf had been unwound from the stranger ’ s face , and i gave a start of surprise . “ he ’ s not a jap , ” i ejaculated in a whisper to poirot .
christie	poirot	“ observation was always your strong point , hastings ! nothing escapes you . no , the man is not a jap . he is an italian. ” we got into the taxi , and poirot gave the driver an address in st. john ’ s wood . i was by now completely fogged . i did not like to ask poirot where we were going in front of our captive , and strove in vain to obtain some light upon the proceedings .
christie	poirot	we alighted at the door of a small house standing back from the road . a returning wayfarer , slightly drunk , was lurching along the pavement and almost collided with poirot , who said something sharply to him which i did not catch . all three of us went up the steps of the house . poirot rang the bell and motioned us to stand a little aside . there was no answer and he rang again and then seized the knocker which he plied for some minutes vigorously .
christie	poirot	a light appeared suddenly above the fanlight , and the door was opened cautiously a little way . “ what the devil do you want ? ” a man ’ s voice demanded harshly . “ i want the doctor . my wife is taken ill . ”
christie	poirot	“ there ’ s no doctor here. ” the man prepared to shut the door , but poirot thrust his foot in adroitly . he became suddenly a perfect caricature of an infuriated frenchman . “ what you say , there is no doctor ? i will have the law of you . you must come ! i will stay here and ring and knock all night . ”
christie	poirot	“ my dear sir—— ” the door was opened again , the man , clad in a dressing-gown and slippers , stepped forward to pacify poirot with an uneasy glance round . “ i will call the police . ”
christie	poirot	poirot prepared to descend the steps . “ no , don ’ t do that for heaven ’ s sake ! ” the man dashed after him . with a neat push poirot sent him staggering down the steps . in another minute all three of us were inside the door and it was pushed to and bolted .
christie	poirot	“ quick—in here. ” poirot led the way into the nearest room switching on the light as he did so . “ and you—behind the curtain. ” “ si , signor , ” said the italian and slid rapidly behind the full folds of rose-coloured velvet which draped the embrasure of the window .
christie	poirot	not a minute too soon . just as he disappeared from view a woman rushed into the room . she was tall with reddish hair and held a scarlet kimono round her slender form .
christie	poirot	“ where is my husband ? ” she cried , with a quick frightened glance . “ who are you ? ” poirot stepped forward with a bow . “ it is to be hoped your husband will not suffer from a chill . i observed that he had slippers on his feet , and that his dressing-gown was a warm one . ”
christie	poirot	“ who are you ? what are you doing in my house ? ” “ it is true that none of us have the pleasure of your acquaintance , madame . it is especially to be regretted as one of our number has come specially from new york in order to meet you . ”
christie	poirot	the curtains parted and the italian stepped out . to my horror i observed that he was brandishing my revolver , which poirot must doubtless have put down through inadvertence in the cab .
christie	poirot	the woman gave a piercing scream and turned to fly , but poirot was standing in front of the closed door . “ let me by , ” she shrieked . “ he will murder me. ” “ who was it dat croaked luigi valdarno ? ” asked the italian hoarsely , brandishing the weapon , and sweeping each one of us with it . we dared not move .
christie	poirot	“ my god , poirot , this is awful . what shall we do ? ” i cried . “ you will oblige me by refraining from talking so much , hastings . i can assure you that our friend will not shoot until i give the word . ”
christie	poirot	“ youse sure o ’ dat , eh ? ” said the italian , leering unpleasantly . it was more than i was , but the woman turned to poirot like a flash . “ what is it you want ? ”
christie	poirot	poirot bowed . “ i do not think it is necessary to insult miss elsa hardt ’ s intelligence by telling her. ” with a swift movement , the woman snatched up a big black velvet cat which served as a cover for the telephone .
christie	poirot	“ they are stitched in the lining of that. ” “ clever , ” murmured poirot appreciatively . he stood aside from the door . “ good evening , madame . i will detain your friend from new york whilst you make your getaway . ”
christie	poirot	“ whatta fool ! ” roared the big italian , and raising the revolver he fired point-blank at the woman ’ s retreating figure just as i flung myself upon him . but the weapon merely clicked harmlessly and poirot ’ s voice rose in mild reproof .
christie	poirot	“ never will you trust your old friend , hastings . i do not care for my friends to carry loaded pistols about with them and never would i permit a mere acquaintance to do so . no , no , _mon ami_. ” this to the italian who swearing hoarsely . poirot continued to address him in a tone of mild reproof : “ see now , what i have done for you . i have saved you from being hanged . and do not think that our beautiful lady will escape . no , no , the house is watched , back and front . straight into the arms of the police they will go . is not that a beautiful and consoling thought ? yes , you may leave the room now . but be careful—be very careful . i——ah , he is gone ! and my friend hastings looks at me with eyes of reproach . but it was all so simple ! it was clear , from the first , that out of several hundred , probably , applicants for no . 4 , montagu mansions only the robinsons were considered suitable . why ? what was there that singled them out from the rest—at practically a glance . their appearance ? possibly , but it was not so unusual . their name , then ! ”
christie	poirot	“ but there ’ s nothing unusual about the name of robinson , ” i cried . “ it ’ s quite a common name. ” “ ah ! _sapristi_ , but exactly ! that was the point . elsa hardt and her husband , or brother or whatever he really is , come from new york , and take a flat in the name of mr. and mrs. robinson . suddenly they learn that one of these secret societies , the mafia , or the camorra , to which doubtless luigi valdarno belonged , is on their track . what do they do ? they hit on a scheme of transparent simplicity . evidently they knew that their pursuers were not personally acquainted with either of them . what then can be simpler ? they offer the flat at an absurdly low rental . of the thousands of young couples in london looking for flats , there can not fail to be several robinsons . it is only a matter of waiting . if you will look at the name of robinson in the telephone directory , you will realize that a fair-haired mrs. robinson was pretty sure to come along sooner or later . then what will happen ? the avenger arrives . he knows the name , he knows the address . he strikes ! all is over , vengeance is satisfied , and miss elsa hardt has escaped by the skin of her teeth once more . by the way , hastings , you must present me to the real mrs. robinson—that delightful and truthful creature ! what will they think when they find their flat has been broken into ! we must hurry back . ah , that sounds like japp and his friends arriving . ”
christie	poirot	a mighty tattoo sounded on the knocker . “ how did you know this address ? ” i asked as i followed poirot out into the hall . “ oh , of course , you had the first mrs. robinson followed when she left the other flat . ”
christie	poirot	“ _a la bonne heure_ , hastings . you use your grey cells at last . now for a little surprise for japp. ” softly unbolting the door , he stuck the cat ’ s head round the edge and ejaculated a piercing “ miaow . ”
christie	poirot	the scotland yard inspector , who was standing outside with another man , jumped in spite of himself . “ oh , it ’ s only monsieur poirot at one of his little jokes ! ” he exclaimed , as poirot ’ s head followed that of the cat . “ let us in , moosior . ”
christie	poirot	“ you have our friends safe and sound ? ” “ yes , we ’ ve got the birds all right . but they hadn ’ t got the goods with them. ” “ i see . so you come to search . well , i am about to depart with hastings , but i should like to give you a little lecture upon the history and habits of the domestic cat . ”
christie	poirot	“ for the lord ’ s sake , have you gone completely balmy ? ” “ the cat , ” declaimed poirot , “ was worshipped by the ancient egyptians . it is still regarded as a symbol of good luck if a black cat crosses your path . this cat crossed your path to-night , japp . to speak of the interior of any animal or any person is not , i know , considered polite in england . but the interior of this cat is perfectly delicate . i refer to the lining . ”
christie	poirot	with a sudden grunt , the second man seized the cat from poirot ’ s hand . “ oh , i forgot to introduce you , ” said japp . “ mr . poirot , this is mr. burt of the united states secret service . ”
christie	poirot	the american ’ s trained fingers had felt what he was looking for . he held out his hand , and for a moment speech failed him . then he rose to the occasion . “ pleased to meet you , ” said mr. burt .
christie	poirot	iv the mystery of hunter ’ s lodge “ after all , ” murmured poirot , “ it is possible that i shall not die this time. ” coming from a convalescent influenza patient , i hailed the remark as showing a beneficial optimism . i myself had been the first sufferer from the disease . poirot in his turn had gone down . he was now sitting up in bed , propped up with pillows , his head muffled in a woollen shawl , and was slowly sipping a particularly noxious tisane which i had prepared according to his directions . his eye rested with pleasure upon a neatly graduated row of medicine bottles which adorned the mantelpiece .
christie	poirot	“ yes , yes , ” my little friend continued . “ once more shall i be myself again , the great hercule poirot , the terror of evil-doers ! figure to yourself , _mon ami_ , that i have a little paragraph to myself in _society gossip_ . but yes ! here it is ! ‘ go it—criminals—all out ! hercule poirot—and believe me , girls , he ’ s some hercules ! —our own pet society detective can ’ t get a grip on you . ’ cause why ? ’ cause he ’ s got _la grippe_ himself ’ ! ”
christie	poirot	i laughed . “ good for you , poirot . you are becoming quite a public character . and fortunately you haven ’ t missed anything of particular interest during this time. ” “ that is true . the few cases i have had to decline did not fill me with any regret . ”
christie	poirot	our landlady stuck her head in at the door . “ there ’ s a gentleman downstairs . says he must see monsieur poirot or you , captain . seeing as he was in a great to-do—and with all that quite the gentleman—i brought up ’ is card . ”
christie	poirot	she handed me the bit of pasteboard . “ mr . roger havering , ” i read . poirot motioned with his head towards the bookcase , and i obediently pulled forth “ who ’ s who. ” poirot took it from me and scanned the pages rapidly .
christie	poirot	“ second son of fifth baron windsor . married 1913 zoe , fourth daughter of william crabb. ” “ h ’ m ! ” i said . “ i rather fancy that ’ s the girl who used to act at the frivolity—only she called herself zoe carrisbrook . i remember she married some young man about town just before the war . ”
christie	poirot	“ would it interest you , hastings , to go down and hear what our visitor ’ s particular little trouble is ? make him all my excuses. ” roger havering was a man of about forty , well set up and of smart appearance . his face , however , was haggard , and he was evidently labouring under great agitation .
christie	poirot	“ captain hastings ? you are monsieur poirot ’ s partner , i understand . it is imperative that he should come with me to derbyshire to-day. ” “ i ’ m afraid that ’ s impossible , ” i replied . “ poirot is ill in bed—influenza . ”
christie	poirot	his face fell . “ dear me , that is a great blow to me. ” “ the matter on which you want to consult him is serious ? ” “ my god , yes ! my uncle , the best friend i have in the world , was foully murdered last night . ”
christie	poirot	“ here in london ? ” “ no , in derbyshire . i was in town and received a telegram from my wife this morning . immediately upon its receipt i determined to come round and beg monsieur poirot to undertake the case . ”
christie	poirot	“ if you will excuse me a minute , ” i said , struck by a sudden idea . i rushed upstairs , and in a few brief words acquainted poirot with the situation . he took any further words out of my mouth .
christie	poirot	“ i see . i see . you want to go yourself , is it not so ? well , why not ? you should know my methods by now . all i ask is that you should report to me fully every day , and follow implicitly any instructions i may wire you . ”
christie	poirot	to this i willingly agreed . • • • • • • • an hour later i was sitting opposite mr. havering in a first-class carriage on the midland railway , speeding rapidly away from london .
christie	poirot	“ to begin with , captain hastings , you must understand that hunter ’ s lodge , where we are going , and where the tragedy took place , is only a small shooting-box in the heart of the derbyshire moors . our real home is near newmarket , and we usually rent a flat in town for the season . hunter ’ s lodge is looked after by a housekeeper who is quite capable of doing all we need when we run down for an occasional week-end . of course , during the shooting season , we take down some of our own servants from newmarket . my uncle , mr. harrington pace ( as you may know , my mother was a miss pace of new york ) , has , for the last three years , made his home with us . he never got on well with my father , or my elder brother , and i suspect that my being somewhat of a prodigal son myself rather increased than diminished his affection towards me . of course i am a poor man , and my uncle was a rich one—in other words , he paid the piper ! but , though exacting in many ways , he was not really hard to get on with , and we all three lived very harmoniously together . two days ago my uncle , rather wearied with some recent gaieties of ours in town , suggested that we should run down to derbyshire for a day or two . my wife telegraphed to mrs. middleton , the housekeeper , and we went down that same afternoon . yesterday evening i was forced to return to town , but my wife and my uncle remained on . this morning i received this telegram. ” he handed it over to me :
christie	poirot	“ come at once uncle harrington murdered last night bring good detective if you can but do come—zoe. ” “ then , as yet you know no details ? ” “ no , i suppose it will be in the evening papers . without doubt the police are in charge . ”
christie	poirot	it was about three o ’ clock when we arrived at the little station of elmer ’ s dale . from there a five-mile drive brought us to a small grey stone building in the midst of the rugged moors .
christie	poirot	“ a lonely place , ” i observed with a shiver . havering nodded . “ i shall try and get rid of it . i could never live here again. ” we unlatched the gate and were walking up the narrow path to the oak door when a familiar figure emerged and came to meet us .
christie	poirot	“ japp ! ” i ejaculated . the scotland yard inspector grinned at me in a friendly fashion before addressing my companion . “ mr . havering , i think ? i ’ ve been sent down from london to take charge of this case , and i ’ d like a word with you , if i may , sir . ”
christie	poirot	“ my wife—— ” “ i ’ ve seen your good lady , sir—and the housekeeper . i won ’ t keep you a moment , but i ’ m anxious to get back to the village now that i ’ ve seen all there is to see here . ”
christie	poirot	“ i know nothing as yet as to what—— ” “ ex-actly , ” said japp soothingly . “ but there are just one or two little points i ’ d like your opinion about all the same . captain hastings here , he knows me , and he ’ ll go on up to the house and tell them you ’ re coming . what have you done with the little man , by the way , captain hastings ? ”
christie	poirot	“ he ’ s ill in bed with influenza. ” “ is he now ? i ’ m sorry to hear that . rather the case of the cart without the horse , your being here without him , isn ’ t it ? ”
christie	poirot	and on his rather ill-timed jest i went on to the house . i rang the bell , as japp had closed the door behind him . after some moments it was opened to me by a middle-aged woman in black .
christie	poirot	“ mr . havering will be here in a moment , ” i explained . “ he has been detained by the inspector . i have come down with him from london to look into the case . perhaps you can tell me briefly what occurred last night . ”
christie	poirot	“ come inside , sir. ” she closed the door behind me , and we stood in the dimly-lighted hall . “ it was after dinner last night , sir , that the man came . he asked to see mr. pace , sir , and , seeing that he spoke the same way , i thought it was an american gentleman friend of mr. pace ’ s and i showed him into the gun-room , and then went to tell mr. pace . he wouldn ’ t give any name , which , of course , was a bit odd , now i come to think of it . i told mr. pace , and he seemed puzzled like , but he said to the mistress : ‘ excuse me , zoe , while i just see what this fellow wants. ’ he went off to the gun-room , and i went back to the kitchen , but after a while i heard loud voices , as if they were quarrelling , and i came out into the hall . at the same time , the mistress she comes out too , and just then there was a shot and then a dreadful silence . we both ran to the gun-room door , but it was locked and we had to go round to the window . it was open , and there inside was mr. pace , all shot and bleeding . ”
christie	poirot	“ what became of the man ? ” “ he must have got away through the window , sir , before we got to it. ” “ and then ? ” “ mrs . havering sent me to fetch the police . five miles to walk it was . they came back with me , and the constable he stayed all night , and this morning the police gentleman from london arrived . ”
christie	poirot	“ what was this man like who called to see mr. pace ? ” the housekeeper reflected . “ he had a black beard , sir , and was about middle-aged , and had on a light overcoat . beyond the fact that he spoke like an american i didn ’ t notice much about him . ”
christie	poirot	“ i see . now i wonder if i can see mrs. havering ? ” “ she ’ s upstairs , sir . shall i tell her ? ” “ if you please . tell her that mr. havering is outside with inspector japp , and that the gentleman he has brought back with him from london is anxious to speak to her as soon as possible . ”
christie	poirot	“ very good , sir. ” i was in a fever of impatience to get at all the facts . japp had two or three hours ’ start of me , and his anxiety to be gone made me keen to be close at his heels .
christie	poirot	mrs. havering did not keep me waiting long . in a few minutes i heard a light step descending the stairs , and looked up to see a very handsome young woman coming towards me . she wore a flame-coloured jumper , that set off the slender boyishness of her figure . on her dark head was a little hat of flame-coloured leather . even the present tragedy could not dim the vitality of her personality .
christie	poirot	i introduced myself , and she nodded in quick comprehension . “ of course i have often heard of you and your colleague , monsieur poirot . you have done some wonderful things together , haven ’ t you ? it was very clever of my husband to get you so promptly . now will you ask me questions ? that is the easiest way , isn ’ t it , of getting to know all you want to about this dreadful affair ? ”
christie	poirot	“ thank you , mrs. havering . now what time was it that this man arrived ? ” “ it must have been just before nine o ’ clock . we had finished dinner , and were sitting over our coffee and cigarettes . ”
christie	poirot	“ your husband had already left for london ? ” “ yes , he went up by the 6.15. ” “ did he go by car to the station , or did he walk ? ” “ our own car isn ’ t down here . one came out from the garage in elmer ’ s dale to fetch him in time for the train . ”
christie	poirot	“ was mr. pace quite his usual self ? ” “ absolutely . most normal in every way. ” “ now , can you describe this visitor at all ? ” “ i ’ m afraid not . i didn ’ t see him . mrs. middleton showed him straight into the gun-room and then came to tell my uncle . ”
christie	poirot	“ what did your uncle say ? ” “ he seemed rather annoyed , but went off at once . it was about five minutes later that i heard the sound of raised voices . i ran out into the hall and almost collided with mrs. middleton . then we heard the shot . the gun-room door was locked on the inside , and we had to go right round the house to the window . of course that took some time , and the murderer had been able to get well away . my poor uncle ” —her voice faltered— “ had been shot through the head . i saw at once that he was dead . i sent mrs. middleton for the police . i was careful to touch nothing in the room but to leave it exactly as i found it . ”
christie	poirot	i nodded approval . “ now , as to the weapon ? ” “ well , i can make a guess at it , captain hastings . a pair of revolvers of my husband ’ s were mounted upon the wall . one of them is missing . i pointed this out to the police , and they took the other one away with them . when they have extracted the bullet , i suppose they will know for certain . ”
christie	poirot	“ may i go to the gun-room ? ” “ certainly . the police have finished with it . but the body has been removed. ” she accompanied me to the scene of the crime . at that moment havering entered the hall , and with a quick apology his wife ran to him . i was left to undertake my investigations alone .
christie	poirot	i may as well confess at once that they were rather disappointing . in detective novels clues abound , but here i could find nothing that struck me as out of the ordinary except a large bloodstain on the carpet where i judged the dead man had fallen . i examined everything with painstaking care and took a couple of pictures of the room with my little camera which i had brought with me . i also examined the ground outside the window , but it appeared to have been so heavily trampled underfoot that i judged it was useless to waste time over it . no , i had seen all that hunter ’ s lodge had to show me . i must go back to elmer ’ s dale and get into touch with japp . accordingly i took leave of the haverings , and was driven off in the car that had brought us up from the station .
christie	poirot	i found japp at the matlock arms and he took me forthwith to see the body . harrington pace was a small , spare clean-shaven man , typically american in appearance . he had been shot through the back of the head , and the revolver had been discharged at close quarters .
christie	poirot	“ turned away for a moment , ” remarked japp , “ and the other fellow snatched up a revolver and shot him . the one mrs. havering handed over to us was fully loaded and i suppose the other one was also . curious what darn fool things people do . fancy keeping two loaded revolvers hanging up on your wall . ”
christie	poirot	“ what do you think of the case ? ” i asked , as we left the gruesome chamber behind us . “ well , i ’ d got my eye on havering to begin with . oh , yes ! ” noting my exclamation of astonishment . “ havering has one or two shady incidents in his past . when he was a boy at oxford there was some funny business about the signature on one of his father ’ s cheques . all hushed up of course . then , he ’ s pretty heavily in debt now , and they ’ re the kind of debts he wouldn ’ t like to go to his uncle about , whereas you may be sure the uncle ’ s will would be in his favour . yes , i ’ d got my eye on him , and that ’ s why i wanted to speak to him before he saw his wife , but their statements dovetail all right , and i ’ ve been to the station and there ’ s no doubt whatever that he left by the 6.15 . that gets up to london about 10.30 . he went straight to his club , he says , and if that ’ s confirmed all right—why , he couldn ’ t have been shooting his uncle here at nine o ’ clock in a black beard ! ”
christie	poirot	“ ah , yes , i was going to ask you what you thought about that beard ? ” japp winked . “ i think it grew pretty fast—grew in the five miles from elmer ’ s dale to hunter ’ s lodge . americans that i ’ ve met are mostly clean-shaven . yes , it ’ s amongst mr. pace ’ s american associates that we ’ ll have to look for the murderer . i questioned the housekeeper first , and then her mistress , and their stories agree all right , but i ’ m sorry mrs. havering didn ’ t get a look at the fellow . she ’ s a smart woman , and she might have noticed something that would set us on the track . ”
christie	poirot	i sat down and wrote a minute and lengthy account to poirot . i was able to add various further items of information before i posted the letter . the bullet had been extracted and was proved to have been fired from a revolver identical with the one held by the police . furthermore , mr. havering ’ s movements on the night in question had been checked and verified , and it was proved beyond doubt that he had actually arrived in london by the train in question . and , thirdly , a sensational development had occurred . a city gentleman , living at ealing , on crossing haven green to get to the district railway station that morning , had observed a brown-paper parcel stuck between the railings . opening it , he found that it contained a revolver . he handed the parcel over to the local police station , and before night it was proved to be the one we were in search of , the fellow to that given us by mrs. havering . one bullet had been fired from it .
christie	poirot	all this i added to my report . a wire from poirot arrived whilst i was at breakfast the following morning : “ of course black bearded man was not havering only you or japp would have such an idea wire me description of housekeeper and what clothes she wore this morning same of mrs. havering do not waste time taking photographs of interiors they are underexposed and not in the least artistic . ”
christie	poirot	it seemed to me that poirot ’ s style was unnecessarily facetious . i also fancied he was a shade jealous of my position on the spot with full facilities for handling the case . his request for a description of the clothes worn by the two women appeared to me to be simply ridiculous , but i complied as well as i , a mere man , was able to .
christie	poirot	at eleven a reply wire came from poirot : “ advise japp arrest housekeeper before it is too late. ” dumbfounded , i took the wire to japp . he swore softly under his breath .
christie	poirot	“ he ’ s the goods , monsieur poirot ! if he says so , there ’ s something in it . and i hardly noticed the woman . i don ’ t know that i can go so far as arresting her , but i ’ ll have her watched . we ’ ll go up right away , and take another look at her . ”
christie	poirot	but it was too late . mrs. middleton , that quiet middle-aged woman , who had appeared so normal and respectable , had vanished into thin air . her box had been left behind . it contained only ordinary wearing apparel . there was no clue in it to her identity , or as to her whereabouts .
christie	poirot	from mrs. havering we elicited all the facts we could : “ i engaged her about three weeks ago when mrs. emery , our former housekeeper , left . she came to me from mrs. selbourne ’ s agency in mount street—a very well-known place . i get all my servants from there . they sent several women to see me , but this mrs. middleton seemed much the nicest , and had splendid references . i engaged her on the spot , and notified the agency of the fact . i can ’ t believe that there was anything wrong with her . she was such a nice quiet woman . ”
christie	poirot	the thing was certainly a mystery . whilst it was clear that the woman herself could not have committed the crime , since at the moment the shot was fired mrs. havering was with her in the hall , nevertheless she must have some connection with the murder , or why should she suddenly take to her heels and bolt ?
christie	poirot	i wired the latest development to poirot and suggested returning to london and making inquiries at selbourne ’ s agency . poirot ’ s reply was prompt : “ useless to inquire at agency they will never have heard of her find out what vehicle took her up to hunters lodge when she first arrived there . ”
christie	poirot	though mystified , i was obedient . the means of transport in elmer ’ s dale were limited . the local garage had two battered ford cars , and there were two station flies . none of these had been requisitioned on the date in question . questioned , mrs. havering explained that she had given the woman the money for her fare down to derbyshire and sufficient to hire a car or fly to take her up to hunter ’ s lodge . there was usually one of the fords at the station on the chance of its being required . taking into consideration the further fact that nobody at the station had noticed the arrival of a stranger , black-bearded or otherwise , on the fatal evening , everything seemed to point to the conclusion that the murderer had come to the spot in a car , which had been waiting near at hand to aid his escape , and that the same car had brought the mysterious housekeeper to her new post . i may mention that inquiries at the agency in london bore out poirot ’ s prognostication . no such woman as “ mrs . middleton ” had ever been on their books . they had received the hon . mrs. havering ’ s application for a housekeeper , and had sent her various applicants for the post . when she sent them the engagement fee , she omitted to mention which woman she had selected .
christie	poirot	somewhat crestfallen , i returned to london . i found poirot established in an arm-chair by the fire in a garish , silk dressing-gown . he greeted me with much affection . “ _mon ami_ hastings ! but how glad i am to see you . veritably i have for you a great affection . and you have enjoyed yourself ? you have run to and fro with the good japp ? you have interrogated and investigated to your heart ’ s content ? ”
christie	poirot	“ poirot , ” i cried , “ the thing ’ s a dark mystery ! it will never be solved. ” “ it is true that we are not likely to cover ourselves with glory over it. ” “ no , indeed . it ’ s a hard nut to crack . ”
christie	poirot	“ oh , as far as that goes , i am very good at cracking the nuts ! a veritable squirrel ! it is not that which embarrasses me . i know well enough who killed mr. harrington pace . ”
christie	poirot	“ you know ? how did you find out ? ” “ your illuminating answers to my wires supplied me with the truth . see here , hastings , let us examine the facts methodically and in order . mr. harrington pace is a man with a considerable fortune which at his death will doubtless pass to his nephew . point no . 1 . his nephew is known to be desperately hard up . point no . 2 . his nephew is also known to be—shall we say a man of rather loose moral fibre ? point no . 3 . ”
christie	poirot	“ but roger havering is proved to have journeyed straight up to london. ” “ _précisément_—and therefore , as mr. havering left elmer ’ s dale at 6.15 , and since mr. pace can not have been killed before he left , or the doctor would have spotted the time of the crime as being given wrongly when he examined the body , we conclude quite rightly , that mr. havering did not shoot his uncle . but there is a mrs. havering , hastings . ”
christie	poirot	“ impossible ! the housekeeper was with her when the shot was fired. ” “ ah , yes , the housekeeper . but she has disappeared. ” “ she will be found. ” “ i think not . there is something peculiarly elusive about that housekeeper , don ’ t you think so , hastings ? it struck me at once . ”
christie	poirot	“ she played her part , i suppose , and then got out in the nick of time. ” “ and what was her part ? ” “ well , presumably to admit her confederate , the black-bearded man. ” “ oh , no , that was not her part ! her part was what you have just mentioned , to provide an alibi for mrs. havering at the moment the shot was fired . and no one will ever find her , _mon ami_ , because she does not exist ! ‘ there ’ s no sech person , ’ as your so great shakespeare says . ”
christie	poirot	“ it was dickens , ” i murmured , unable to suppress a smile . “ but what do you mean , poirot ? ” “ i mean that zoe havering was an actress before her marriage , that you and japp only saw the housekeeper in a dark hall , a dim middle-aged figure in black with a faint subdued voice , and finally that neither you nor japp , nor the local police whom the housekeeper fetched , ever saw mrs. middleton and her mistress at one and the same time . it was child ’ s play for that clever and daring woman . on the pretext of summoning her mistress , she runs upstairs , slips on a bright jumper and a hat with black curls attached which she jams down over the grey transformation . a few deft touches , and the make-up is removed , a slight dusting of rouge , and the brilliant zoe havering comes down with her clear ringing voice . nobody looks particularly at the housekeeper . why should they ? there is nothing to connect her with the crime . she , too , has an alibi . ”
christie	poirot	“ but the revolver that was found at ealing ? mrs. havering could not have placed it there ? ” “ no , that was roger havering ’ s job—but it was a mistake on their part . it put me on the right track . a man who has committed a murder with a revolver which he found on the spot would fling it away at once , he would not carry it up to london with him . no , the motive was clear , the criminals wished to focus the interest of the police on a spot far removed from derbyshire they were anxious to get the police away as soon as possible from the vicinity of hunter ’ s lodge . of course the revolver found at ealing was not the one with which mr. pace was shot . roger havering discharged one shot from it , brought it up to london , went straight to his club to establish his alibi , then went quickly out to ealing by the district , a matter of about twenty minutes only , placed the parcel where it was found and so back to town . that charming creature , his wife , quietly shoots mr. pace after dinner—you remember he was shot from behind ? another significant point , that ! —reloads the revolver and puts it back in its place , and then starts off with her desperate little comedy . ”
christie	poirot	“ it ’ s incredible , ” i murmured , fascinated , “ and yet—— ” “ and yet it is true . _bien sur_ , my friend , it is true . but to bring that precious pair to justice , that is another matter . well , japp must do what he can—i have written him fully—but i very much fear , hastings , that we shall be obliged to leave them to fate , or _le bon dieu_ , whichever you prefer . ”
christie	poirot	“ the wicked flourish like a green bay tree , ” i reminded him . “ but at a price , hastings , always at a price , _croyez-moi ! _ ” poirot ’ s forebodings were confirmed . japp , though convinced of the truth of his theory , was unable to get together the necessary evidence to ensure a conviction .
christie	poirot	mr. pace ’ s huge fortune passed into the hands of his murderers . nevertheless , nemesis did overtake them , and when i read in the paper that the hon . roger and mrs. havering were amongst those killed in the crashing of the air mail to paris i knew that justice was satisfied .
christie	poirot	v the million dollar bond robbery “ what a number of bond robberies there have been lately ! ” i observed one morning , laying aside the newspaper . “ poirot , let us forsake the science of detection , and take to crime instead ! ”
christie	poirot	“ you are on the—how do you say it ? —get-rich-quick tack , eh , _mon ami_ ? ” “ well , look at this last _coup_ , the million dollars ’ worth of liberty bonds which the london and scottish bank were sending to new york , and which disappeared in such a remarkable manner on board the _olympia_ . ”
christie	poirot	“ if it were not for the _mal de mer_ , and the difficulty of practising the so excellent method of laverguier for a longer time than the few hours of crossing the channel , i should delight to voyage myself on one of these big liners , ” murmured poirot dreamily .
christie	poirot	“ yes , indeed , ” i said enthusiastically . “ some of them must be perfect palaces ; the swimming-baths , the lounges , the restaurant , the palm courts—really , it must be hard to believe that one is on the sea . ”
christie	poirot	“ me , i always know when i am on the sea , ” said poirot sadly . “ and all those bagatelles that you enumerate , they say nothing to me ; but , my friend , consider for a moment the geniuses that travel as it were incognito ! on board these floating palaces , as you so justly call them , one would meet the élite , the _haute noblesse_ of the criminal world ! ”
christie	poirot	i laughed . “ so that ’ s the way your enthusiasm runs ! you would have liked to cross swords with the man who sneaked the liberty bonds ? ” the landlady interrupted us . “ a young lady as wants to see you , mr. poirot . here ’ s her card . ”
christie	poirot	the card bore the inscription : miss esmée farquhar , and poirot , after diving under the table to retrieve a stray crumb , and putting it carefully in the waste-paper-basket , nodded to the landlady to admit her .
christie	poirot	in another minute one of the most charming girls i have ever seen was ushered into the room . she was perhaps about five-and-twenty , with big brown eyes and a perfect figure . she was well-dressed and perfectly composed in manner .
christie	poirot	“ sit down , i beg of you , mademoiselle . this is my friend , captain hastings , who aids me in my little problems. ” “ i am afraid it is a big problem i have brought you to-day , monsieur poirot , ” said the girl , giving me a pleasant bow as she seated herself . “ i dare say you have read about it in the papers . i am referring to the theft of liberty bonds on the _olympia_. ” some astonishment must have shown itself in poirot ’ s face , for she continued quickly : “ you are doubtless asking yourself what i have to do with a grave institution like the london and scottish bank . in one sense nothing , in another sense everything . you see , monsieur poirot , i am engaged to mr. philip ridgeway . ”
christie	poirot	“ aha ! and mr. philip ridgeway—— ” “ was in charge of the bonds when they were stolen . of course no actual blame can attach to him , it was not his fault in any way . nevertheless , he is half distraught over the matter , and his uncle , i know , insists that he must carelessly have mentioned having them in his possession . it is a terrible set-back in his career . ”
christie	poirot	“ who is his uncle ? ” “ mr . vavasour , joint general manager of the london and scottish bank. ” “ suppose , miss farquhar , that you recount to me the whole story ? ” “ very well . as you know , the bank wished to extend their credits in america , and for this purpose decided to send over a million dollars in liberty bonds . mr. vavasour selected his nephew , who had occupied a position of trust in the bank for many years and who was conversant with all the details of the bank ’ s dealings in new york , to make the trip . the olympia sailed from liverpool on the 23rd , and the bonds were handed over to philip on the morning of that day by mr. vavasour and mr. shaw , the two joint general managers of the london and scottish bank . they were counted , enclosed in a package , and sealed in his presence , and he then locked the package at once in his portmanteau . ”
christie	poirot	“ a portmanteau with an ordinary lock ? ” “ no , mr. shaw insisted on a special lock being fitted to it by hubbs ’ s . philip , as i say , placed the package at the bottom of the trunk . it was stolen just a few hours before reaching new york . a rigorous search of the whole ship was made , but without result . the bonds seemed literally to have vanished into thin air . ”
christie	poirot	poirot made a grimace . “ but they did not vanish absolutely , since i gather that they were sold in small parcels within half an hour of the docking of the _olympia_ ! well , undoubtedly the next thing is for me to see mr. ridgeway . ”
christie	poirot	“ i was about to suggest that you should lunch with me at the ‘ cheshire cheese. ’ philip will be there . he is meeting me , but does not yet know that i have been consulting you on his behalf . ”
christie	poirot	we agreed to this suggestion readily enough , and drove there in a taxi . mr. philip ridgeway was there before us , and looked somewhat surprised to see his fiancée arriving with two complete strangers . he was a nice-looking young fellow , tall and spruce , with a touch of greying hair at the temples , though he could not have been much over thirty .
christie	poirot	miss farquhar went up to him and laid her hand on his arm . “ you must forgive my acting without consulting you , philip , ” she said . “ let me introduce you to monsieur hercule poirot , of whom you must often have heard , and his friend , captain hastings . ”
christie	poirot	ridgeway looked very astonished . “ of course i have heard of you , monsieur poirot , ” he said , as he shook hands . “ but i had no idea that esmée was thinking of consulting you about my—our trouble . ”
christie	poirot	“ i was afraid you would not let me do it , philip , ” said miss farquhar meekly . “ so you took care to be on the safe side , ” he observed , with a smile . “ i hope monsieur poirot will be able to throw some light on this extraordinary puzzle , for i confess frankly that i am nearly out of my mind with worry and anxiety about it . ”
christie	poirot	indeed , his face looked drawn and haggard and showed only too clearly the strain under which he was labouring . “ well , well , ” said poirot . “ let us lunch , and over lunch we will put our heads together and see what can be done . i want to hear mr. ridgeway ’ s story from his own lips . ”
christie	poirot	whilst we discussed the excellent steak and kidney pudding of the establishment , philip ridgeway narrated the circumstances leading to the disappearance of the bonds . his story agreed with that of miss farquhar in every particular . when he had finished , poirot took up the thread with a question .
christie	poirot	“ what exactly led you to discover that the bonds had been stolen , mr. ridgeway ? ” he laughed rather bitterly . “ the thing stared me in the face , monsieur poirot . i couldn ’ t have missed it . my cabin trunk was half out from under the bunk and all scratched and cut about where they ’ d tried to force the lock . ”
christie	poirot	“ but i understood that it had been opened with a key ? ” “ that ’ s so . they tried to force it , but couldn ’ t . and , in the end , they must have got it unlocked somehow or other . ”
christie	poirot	“ curious , ” said poirot , his eyes beginning to flicker with the green light i knew so well . “ very curious ! they waste much , much time trying to prise it open , and then—_sapristi ! _ they find that they have the key all the time—for each of hubbs ’ s locks are unique . ”
christie	poirot	“ that ’ s just why they couldn ’ t have had the key . it never left me day or night. ” “ you are sure of that ? ” “ i can swear to it , and besides , if they had had the key or a duplicate , why should they waste time trying to force an obviously unforceable lock ? ”
christie	poirot	“ ah ! there is exactly the question we are asking ourselves ! i venture to prophesy that the solution , if we ever find it , will hinge on that curious fact . i beg of you not to assault me if i ask you one more question : _are you perfectly certain you did not leave the trunk unlocked ? _ ”
christie	poirot	philip ridgeway merely looked at him , and poirot gesticulated apologetically . “ ah , but these things can happen , i assure you ! very well , the bonds were stolen from the trunk . what did the thief do with them ? how did he manage to get ashore with them ? ”
christie	poirot	“ ah ! ” cried ridgeway . “ that ’ s just it . how ? word was passed to the customs authorities , and every soul that left the ship was gone over with a toothcomb ! ” “ and the bonds , i gather , made a bulky package ? ”
christie	poirot	“ certainly they did . they could hardly have been hidden on board—and anyway we know they weren ’ t because they were offered for sale within half an hour of the _olympia ’ s_ arrival , long before i got the cables going and the numbers sent out . one broker swears he bought some of them even before the _olympia_ got in . but you can ’ t send bonds by wireless . ”
christie	poirot	“ not by wireless , but did any tug come alongside ? ” “ only the official ones , and that was after the alarm was given when every one was on the look-out . i was watching out myself for their being passed over to some one that way . my god , monsieur poirot , this thing will drive me mad ! people are beginning to say i stole them myself . ”
christie	poirot	“ but you also were searched on landing , weren ’ t you ? ” asked poirot gently . “ yes. ” the young man stared at him in a puzzled manner . “ you do not catch my meaning , i see , ” said poirot , smiling enigmatically . “ now i should like to make a few inquiries at the bank . ”
christie	poirot	ridgeway produced a card and scribbled a few words on it . “ send this in and my uncle will see you at once. ” poirot thanked him , bade farewell to miss farquhar , and together we started out for threadneedle street and the head office of the london and scottish bank . on production of ridgeway ’ s card , we were led through the labyrinth of counters and desks , skirting paying-in clerks and paying-out clerks and up to a small office on the first floor where the joint general managers received us . they were two grave gentlemen , who had grown grey in the service of the bank . mr. vavasour had a short white beard , mr. shaw was clean shaven .
christie	poirot	“ i understand you are strictly a private inquiry agent ? ” said mr. vavasour . “ quite so , quite so . we have , of course , placed ourselves in the hands of scotland yard . inspector mcneil has charge of the case . a very able officer , i believe . ”
christie	poirot	“ i am sure of it , ” said poirot politely . “ you will permit a few questions , on your nephew ’ s behalf ? about this lock , who ordered it from hubbs ’ s ? ” “ i ordered it myself , ” said mr. shaw . “ i would not trust to any clerk in the matter . as to the keys , mr. ridgeway had one , and the other two are held by my colleague and myself . ”
christie	poirot	“ and no clerk has had access to them ? ” mr. shaw turned inquiringly to mr. vavasour . “ i think i am correct in saying that they have remained in the safe where we placed them on the 23rd , ” said mr. vavasour . “ my colleague was unfortunately taken ill a fortnight ago—in fact on the very day that philip left us . he has only just recovered . ”
christie	poirot	“ severe bronchitis is no joke to a man of my age , ” said mr. shaw ruefully . “ but i am afraid mr. vavasour has suffered from the hard work entailed by my absence , especially with this unexpected worry coming on top of everything . ”
christie	poirot	poirot asked a few more questions . i judged that he was endeavouring to gauge the exact amount of intimacy between uncle and nephew . mr. vavasour ’ s answers were brief and punctilious . his nephew was a trusted official of the bank , and had no debts or money difficulties that he knew of . he had been entrusted with similar missions in the past . finally we were politely bowed out .
christie	poirot	“ i am disappointed , ” said poirot , as we emerged into the street . “ you hoped to discover more ? they are such stodgy old men. ” “ it is not their stodginess which disappoints me , _mon ami_ . i do not expect to find in a bank manager a ‘ keen financier with an eagle glance ’ as your favourite works of fiction put it . no , i am disappointed in the case—it is too easy ! ”
christie	poirot	“ easy ? ” “ yes , do you not find it almost childishly simple ? ” “ you know who stole the bonds ? ” “ i do. ” “ but then—we must—why—— ” “ do not confuse and fluster yourself , hastings . we are not going to do anything at present . ”
christie	poirot	“ but why ? what are you waiting for ? ” “ for the _olympia_ . she is due on her return trip from new york on tuesday. ” “ but if you know who stole the bonds , why wait ? he may escape . ”
christie	poirot	“ to a south sea island where there is no extradition ? no , _mon ami_ , he would find life very uncongenial there . as to why i wait—_eh bien_ to the intelligence of hercule poirot the case is perfectly clear , but for the benefit of others , not so greatly gifted by the good god—the inspector mcneil , for instance—it would be as well to make a few inquiries to establish the facts . one must have consideration for those less gifted than oneself . ”
christie	poirot	“ good lord , poirot ! do you know , i ’ d give a considerable sum of money to see you make a thorough ass of yourself—just for once . you ’ re so confoundedly conceited ! ” “ do not enrage yourself , hastings . in verity , i observe that there are times when you almost detest me ! alas , i suffer the penalties of greatness ! ”
christie	poirot	the little man puffed out his chest , and sighed so comically that i was forced to laugh . tuesday saw us speeding to liverpool in a first-class carriage of the l. & n.w.r . poirot had obstinately refused to enlighten me as to his suspicions—or certainties . he contented himself with expressing surprise that i , too , was not equally _au fait_ with the situation . i disdained to argue , and entrenched my curiosity behind a rampart of pretended indifference .
christie	poirot	once arrived at the quay alongside which lay the big transatlantic liner , poirot became brisk and alert . our proceedings consisted in interviewing four successive stewards and inquiring after a friend of poirot ’ s who had crossed to new york on the 23rd .
christie	poirot	“ an elderly gentleman , wearing glasses . a great invalid , hardly moved out of his cabin. ” the description appeared to tally with one mr. ventnor who had occupied the cabin c 24 which was next to that of philip ridgeway . although unable to see how poirot had deduced mr. ventnor ’ s existence and personal appearance , i was keenly excited .
christie	poirot	“ tell me , ” i cried , “ was this gentleman one of the first to land when you got to new york ? ” the steward shook his head . “ no , indeed , sir , he was one of the last off the boat . ”
christie	poirot	i retired crestfallen , and observed poirot grinning at me . he thanked the steward , a note changed hands , and we took our departure . “ it ’ s all very well , ” i remarked heatedly , “ but that last answer must have damped your precious theory , grin as you please ! ”
christie	poirot	“ as usual , you see nothing , hastings . that last answer is , on the contrary , the coping-stone of my theory. ” i flung up my hands in despair . “ i give it up. ” • • • • • • •
christie	poirot	when we were in the train , speeding towards london , poirot wrote busily for a few minutes , sealing up the result in an envelope . “ this is for the good inspector mcneil . we will leave it at scotland yard in passing , and then to the rendezvous restaurant , where i have asked miss esmée farquhar to do us the honour of dining with us . ”
christie	poirot	“ what about ridgeway ? ” “ what about him ? ” asked poirot with a twinkle . “ why , you surely don ’ t think—you can ’ t—— ” “ the habit of incoherence is growing upon you , hastings . as a matter of fact i _did_ think . if ridgeway had been the thief—which was perfectly possible—the case would have been charming ; a piece of neat methodical work . ”
christie	poirot	“ but not so charming for miss farquhar. ” “ possibly you are right . therefore all is for the best . now , hastings , let us review the case . i can see that you are dying to do so . the sealed package is removed from the trunk and vanishes , as miss farquhar puts it , into thin air . we will dismiss the thin air theory , which is not practicable at the present stage of science , and consider what is likely to have become of it . every one asserts the incredibility of its being smuggled ashore—— ”
christie	poirot	“ yes , but we know—— ” “ _you_ may know , hastings . i do not . i take the view that , since it seemed incredible , it _was_ incredible . two possibilities remain : it was hidden on board—also rather difficult—or it was thrown overboard . ”
christie	poirot	“ with a cork on it , do you mean ? ” “ without a cork. ” i stared . “ but if the bonds were thrown overboard , they couldn ’ t have been sold in new york. ” “ i admire your logical mind , hastings . the bonds were sold in new york , therefore they were not thrown overboard . you see where that leads us ? ”
christie	poirot	“ where we were when we started. ” “ _jamais de la vie ! _ if the package was thrown overboard , and the bonds were sold in new york , the package could not have contained the bonds . is there any evidence that the package _did_ contain the bonds ? remember , mr. ridgeway never opened it from the time it was placed in his hands in london . ”
christie	poirot	“ yes , but then—— ” poirot waved an impatient hand . “ permit me to continue . the last moment that the bonds are seen as bonds is in the office of the london and scottish bank on the morning of the 23rd . they reappear in new york half an hour after the _olympia_ gets in , and according to one man , whom nobody listens to , actually _before_ she gets in . supposing then , that they have never been on the _olympia_ at all ? is there any other way they could get to new york ? yes . the _gigantic_ leaves southampton on the same day as the _olympia_ , and she holds the record for the atlantic . mailed by the _gigantic_ , the bonds would be in new york the day before the _olympia_ arrived . all is clear , the case begins to explain itself . the sealed packet is only a dummy , and the moment of its substitution must be in the office in the bank . it would be an easy matter for any of the three men present to have prepared a duplicate package which could be substituted for the genuine one . _très bien_ , the bonds are mailed to a confederate in new york , with instructions to sell as soon as the _olympia_ is in , but some one must travel on the _olympia_ to engineer the supposed moment of the robbery . ”
christie	poirot	“ but why ? ” “ because if ridgeway merely opens the packet and finds it a dummy , suspicion flies at once to london . no , the man on board in the cabin next door does his work , pretends to force the lock in an obvious manner so as to draw immediate attention to the theft , really unlocks the trunk with a duplicate key , throws the package overboard and waits until the last to leave the boat . naturally he wears glasses to conceal his eyes , and is an invalid since he does not want to run the risk of meeting ridgeway . he steps ashore in new york and returns by the first boat available . ”
christie	poirot	“ but who—which was he ? ” “ the man who had a duplicate key , the man who ordered the lock , the man who has _not_ been severely ill with bronchitis at his home in the country—_enfin_ , that ‘ stodgy ’ old man , mr. shaw ! there are criminals in high places sometimes , my friend . ah , here we are . mademoiselle , i have succeeded ! you permit ? ”
christie	poirot	and , beaming , poirot kissed the astonished girl lightly on either cheek ! vi the adventure of the egyptian tomb i have always considered that one of the most thrilling and dramatic of the many adventures i have shared with poirot was that of our investigation into the strange series of deaths which followed upon the discovery and opening of the tomb of king men-her-ra .
christie	poirot	hard upon the discovery of the tomb of tut-ankh-amen by lord carnarvon , sir john willard and mr. bleibner of new york , pursuing their excavations not far from cairo , in the vicinity of the pyramids of gizeh , came unexpectedly on a series of funeral chambers . the greatest interest was aroused by their discovery . the tomb appeared to be that of king men-her-ra , one of those shadowy kings of the eighth dynasty , when the old kingdom was falling to decay . little was known about this period , and the discoveries were fully reported in the newspapers .
christie	poirot	an event soon occurred which took a profound hold on the public mind . sir john willard died quite suddenly of heart failure . the more sensational newspapers immediately took the opportunity of reviving all the old superstitious stories connected with the ill luck of certain egyptian treasures . the unlucky mummy at the british museum , that hoary old chestnut , was dragged out with fresh zest , was quietly denied by the museum , but nevertheless enjoyed all its usual vogue .
christie	poirot	a fortnight later mr. bleibner died of acute blood poisoning , and a few days afterwards a nephew of his shot himself in new york . the “ curse of men-her-ra ” was the talk of the day , and the magic power of dead and gone egypt was exalted to a fetish point .
christie	poirot	it was then that poirot received a brief note from lady willard , widow of the dead archaeologist , asking him to go and see her at her house in kensington square . i accompanied him .
christie	poirot	lady willard was a tall , thin woman , dressed in deep mourning . her haggard face bore eloquent testimony to her recent grief . “ it is kind of you to have come so promptly , monsieur poirot . ”
christie	poirot	“ i am at your service , lady willard . you wished to consult me ? ” “ you are , i am aware , a detective , but it is not only as a detective that i wish to consult you . you are a man of original views , i know , you have imagination , experience of the world , tell me , monsieur poirot , what are your views on the supernatural ? ”
christie	poirot	poirot hesitated for a moment before he replied . he seemed to be considering . finally he said : “ let us not misunderstand each other , lady willard . it is not a general question that you are asking me there . it has a personal application , has it not ? you are referring obliquely to the death of your late husband ? ”
christie	poirot	“ that is so , ” she admitted . “ you want me to investigate the circumstances of his death ? ” “ i want you to ascertain for me exactly how much is newspaper chatter , and how much may be said to be founded on fact ? three deaths , monsieur poirot—each one explicable taken by itself , but taken together surely an almost unbelievable coincidence , and all within a month of the opening of the tomb ! it may be mere superstition , it may be some potent curse from the past that operates in ways undreamed of by modern science . the fact remains—three deaths ! and i am afraid , monsieur poirot , horribly afraid . it may not yet be the end . ”
christie	poirot	“ for whom do you fear ? ” “ for my son . when the news of my husband ’ s death came i was ill. my son , who has just come down from oxford , went out there . he brought the—the body home , but now he has gone out again , in spite of my prayers and entreaties . he is so fascinated by the work that he intends to take his father ’ s place and carry on the system of excavations . you may think me a foolish , credulous woman , but , monsieur poirot , i am afraid . supposing that the spirit of the dead king is not yet appeased ? perhaps to you i seem to be talking nonsense—— ”
christie	poirot	“ no , indeed , lady willard , ” said poirot quickly . “ i , too , believe in the force of superstition , one of the greatest forces the world has ever known. ” i looked at him in surprise . i should never have credited poirot with being superstitious . but the little man was obviously in earnest .
christie	poirot	“ what you really demand is that i shall protect your son ? i will do my utmost to keep him from harm. ” “ yes , in the ordinary way , but against an occult influence ? ”
christie	poirot	“ in volumes of the middle ages , lady willard , you will find many ways of counteracting black magic . perhaps they knew more than we moderns with all our boasted science . now let us come to facts , that i may have guidance . your husband had always been a devoted egyptologist , hadn ’ t he ? ”
christie	poirot	“ yes , from his youth upwards . he was one of the greatest living authorities upon the subject. ” “ but mr. bleibner , i understand , was more or less of an amateur ? ” “ oh , quite . he was a very wealthy man who dabbled freely in any subject that happened to take his fancy . my husband managed to interest him in egyptology , and it was his money that was so useful in financing the expedition . ”
christie	poirot	“ and the nephew ? what do you know of his tastes ? was he with the party at all ? ” “ i do not think so . in fact i never knew of his existence till i read of his death in the paper , i do not think he and mr. bleibner can have been at all intimate . he never spoke of having any relations . ”
christie	poirot	“ who are the other members of the party ? ” “ well , there is dr. tosswill , a minor official connected with the british museum ; mr. schneider of the metropolitan museum in new york ; a young american secretary ; dr. ames , who accompanies the expedition in his professional capacity ; and hassan , my husband ’ s devoted native servant . ”
christie	poirot	“ do you remember the name of the american secretary ? ” “ harper , i think , but i can not be sure . he had not been with mr. bleibner very long , i know . he was a very pleasant young fellow . ”
christie	poirot	“ thank you , lady willard. ” “ if there is anything else—— ? ” “ for the moment , nothing . leave it now in my hands , and be assured that i will do all that is humanly possible to protect your son . ”
christie	poirot	they were not exactly reassuring words , and i observed lady willard wince as he uttered them . yet , at the same time , the fact that he had not pooh-poohed her fears seemed in itself to be a relief to her .
christie	poirot	for my part i had never before suspected that poirot had so deep a vein of superstition in his nature . i tackled him on the subject as we went homewards . his manner was grave and earnest .
christie	poirot	“ but yes , hastings . i believe in these things . you must not underrate the force of superstition. ” “ what are we going to do about it ? ” “ _toujours pratique_ , the good hastings ! _eh bien_ , to begin with we are going to cable to new york for fuller details of young mr. bleibner ’ s death . ”
christie	poirot	he duly sent off his cable . the reply was full and precise . young rupert bleibner had been in low water for several years . he had been a beach-comber and a remittance man in several south sea islands , but had returned to new york two years ago , where he had rapidly sunk lower and lower . the most significant thing , to my mind , was that he had recently managed to borrow enough money to take him to egypt . “ i ’ ve a good friend there i can borrow from , ” he had declared . here , however , his plans had gone awry . he had returned to new york cursing his skinflint of an uncle who cared more for the bones of dead and gone kings than his own flesh and blood . it was during his sojourn in egypt that the death of sir john willard occurred . rupert had plunged once more into his life of dissipation in new york , and then , without warning , he had committed suicide , leaving behind him a letter which contained some curious phrases . it seemed written in a sudden fit of remorse . he referred to himself as a leper and an outcast , and the letter ended by declaring that such as he were better dead .
christie	poirot	a shadowy theory leapt into my brain . i had never really believed in the vengeance of a long dead egyptian king . i saw here a more modern crime . supposing this young man had decided to do away with his uncle—preferably by poison . by mistake , sir john willard receives the fatal dose . the young man returns to new york , haunted by his crime . the news of his uncle ’ s death reaches him . he realizes how unnecessary his crime has been , and stricken with remorse takes his own life .
christie	poirot	i outlined my solution to poirot . he was interested . “ it is ingenious what you have thought of there—decidedly it is ingenious . it may even be true . but you leave out of count the fatal influence of the tomb . ”
christie	poirot	i shrugged my shoulders . “ you still think that has something to do with it ? ” “ so much so , _mon ami_ , that we start for egypt to-morrow. ” “ what ? ” i cried , astonished . “ i have said it. ” an expression of conscious heroism spread over poirot ’ s face . then he groaned . “ but , oh , ” he lamented , “ the sea ! the hateful sea ! ”
christie	poirot	• • • • • • • it was a week later . beneath our feet was the golden sand of the desert . the hot sun poured down overhead . poirot , the picture of misery , wilted by my side . the little man was not a good traveller . our four days ’ voyage from marseilles had been one long agony to him . he had landed at alexandria the wraith of his former self , even his usual neatness had deserted him . we had arrived in cairo and had driven out at once to the mena house hotel , right in the shadow of the pyramids .
christie	poirot	the charm of egypt had laid hold of me . not so poirot . dressed precisely the same as in london , he carried a small clothes-brush in his pocket and waged an unceasing war on the dust which accumulated on his dark apparel .
christie	poirot	“ and my boots , ” he wailed . “ regard them , hastings . my boots , of the neat patent leather , usually so smart and shining . see , the sand is inside them , which is painful , and outside them , which outrages the eyesight . also the heat , it causes my moustaches to become limp—but limp ! ”
christie	poirot	“ look at the sphinx , ” i urged . “ even i can feel the mystery and the charm it exhales. ” poirot looked at it discontentedly . “ it has not the air happy , ” he declared . “ how could it , half-buried in sand in that untidy fashion . ah , this cursed sand ! ”
christie	poirot	“ come , now , there ’ s a lot of sand in belgium , ” i reminded him , mindful of a holiday spent at knocke-sur-mer in the midst of “ _les dunes impeccables_ ” as the guide-book had phrased it .
christie	poirot	“ not in brussels , ” declared poirot . he gazed at the pyramids thoughtfully . “ it is true that they , at least , are of a shape solid and geometrical , but their surface is of an unevenness most unpleasing . and the palm-trees i like them not . not even do they plant them in rows ! ”
christie	poirot	i cut short his lamentations , by suggesting that we should start for the camp . we were to ride there on camels , and the beasts were patiently kneeling , waiting for us to mount , in charge of several picturesque boys headed by a voluble dragoman .
christie	poirot	i pass over the spectacle of poirot on a camel . he started by groans and lamentations and ended by shrieks , gesticulations and invocations to the virgin mary and every saint in the calendar . in the end , he descended ignominiously and finished the journey on a diminutive donkey . i must admit that a trotting camel is no joke for the amateur . i was stiff for several days .
christie	poirot	at last we neared the scene of the excavations . a sunburnt man with a grey beard , in white clothes and wearing a helmet , came to meet us . “ monsieur poirot and captain hastings ? we received your cable . i ’ m sorry that there was no one to meet you in cairo . an unforeseen event occurred which completely disorganized our plans . ”
christie	poirot	poirot paled . his hand , which had stolen to his clothes-brush , stayed its course . “ not another death ? ” he breathed . “ yes. ” “ sir guy willard ? ” i cried . “ no , captain hastings . my american colleague , mr. schneider . ”
christie	poirot	“ and the cause ? ” demanded poirot . “ tetanus. ” i blanched . all around me i seemed to feel an atmosphere of evil , subtle and menacing . a horrible thought flashed across me . supposing i were the next ?

christie	styles	chapter i. i go to styles the intense interest aroused in the public by what was known at the time as “ the styles case ” has now somewhat subsided . nevertheless , in view of the world-wide notoriety which attended it , i have been asked , both by my friend poirot and the family themselves , to write an account of the whole story . this , we trust , will effectually silence the sensational rumours which still persist .
christie	styles	i will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my being connected with the affair . i had been invalided home from the front ; and , after spending some months in a rather depressing convalescent home , was given a month ’ s sick leave . having no near relations or friends , i was trying to make up my mind what to do , when i ran across john cavendish . i had seen very little of him for some years . indeed , i had never known him particularly well . he was a good fifteen years my senior , for one thing , though he hardly looked his forty-five years . as a boy , though , i had often stayed at styles , his mother ’ s place in essex .
christie	styles	we had a good yarn about old times , and it ended in his inviting me down to styles to spend my leave there . “ the mater will be delighted to see you again—after all those years , ” he added .
christie	styles	“ your mother keeps well ? ” i asked . “ oh , yes . i suppose you know that she has married again ? ” i am afraid i showed my surprise rather plainly . mrs. cavendish , who had married john ’ s father when he was a widower with two sons , had been a handsome woman of middle-age as i remembered her . she certainly could not be a day less than seventy now . i recalled her as an energetic , autocratic personality , somewhat inclined to charitable and social notoriety , with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the lady bountiful . she was a most generous woman , and possessed a considerable fortune of her own .
christie	styles	their country-place , styles court , had been purchased by mr. cavendish early in their married life . he had been completely under his wife ’ s ascendancy , so much so that , on dying , he left the place to her for her lifetime , as well as the larger part of his income ; an arrangement that was distinctly unfair to his two sons . their step-mother , however , had always been most generous to them ; indeed , they were so young at the time of their father ’ s remarriage that they always thought of her as their own mother .
christie	styles	lawrence , the younger , had been a delicate youth . he had qualified as a doctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine , and lived at home while pursuing literary ambitions ; though his verses never had any marked success .
christie	styles	john practised for some time as a barrister , but had finally settled down to the more congenial life of a country squire . he had married two years ago , and had taken his wife to live at styles , though i entertained a shrewd suspicion that he would have preferred his mother to increase his allowance , which would have enabled him to have a home of his own . mrs. cavendish , however , was a lady who liked to make her own plans , and expected other people to fall in with them , and in this case she certainly had the whip hand , namely : the purse strings .
christie	styles	john noticed my surprise at the news of his mother ’ s remarriage and smiled rather ruefully . “ rotten little bounder too ! ” he said savagely . “ i can tell you , hastings , it ’ s making life jolly difficult for us . as for evie—you remember evie ? ”
christie	styles	“ no. ” “ oh , i suppose she was after your time . she ’ s the mater ’ s factotum , companion , jack of all trades ! a great sport—old evie ! not precisely young and beautiful , but as game as they make them . ”
christie	styles	“ you were going to say—— ? ” “ oh , this fellow ! he turned up from nowhere , on the pretext of being a second cousin or something of evie ’ s , though she didn ’ t seem particularly keen to acknowledge the relationship . the fellow is an absolute outsider , anyone can see that . he ’ s got a great black beard , and wears patent leather boots in all weathers ! but the mater cottoned to him at once , took him on as secretary—you know how she ’ s always running a hundred societies ? ”
christie	styles	i nodded . “ well , of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands . no doubt the fellow was very useful to her . but you could have knocked us all down with a feather when , three months ago , she suddenly announced that she and alfred were engaged ! the fellow must be at least twenty years younger than she is ! it ’ s simply bare-faced fortune hunting ; but there you are—she is her own mistress , and she ’ s married him . ”
christie	styles	“ it must be a difficult situation for you all. ” “ difficult ! it ’ s damnable ! ” thus it came about that , three days later , i descended from the train at styles st. mary , an absurd little station , with no apparent reason for existence , perched up in the midst of green fields and country lanes . john cavendish was waiting on the platform , and piloted me out to the car .
christie	styles	“ got a drop or two of petrol still , you see , ” he remarked . “ mainly owing to the mater ’ s activities. ” the village of styles st. mary was situated about two miles from the little station , and styles court lay a mile the other side of it . it was a still , warm day in early july . as one looked out over the flat essex country , lying so green and peaceful under the afternoon sun , it seemed almost impossible to believe that , not so very far away , a great war was running its appointed course . i felt i had suddenly strayed into another world . as we turned in at the lodge gates , john said :
christie	styles	“ i ’ m afraid you ’ ll find it very quiet down here , hastings. ” “ my dear fellow , that ’ s just what i want. ” “ oh , it ’ s pleasant enough if you want to lead the idle life . i drill with the volunteers twice a week , and lend a hand at the farms . my wife works regularly ‘ on the land ’ . she is up at five every morning to milk , and keeps at it steadily until lunchtime . it ’ s a jolly good life taking it all round—if it weren ’ t for that fellow alfred inglethorp ! ” he checked the car suddenly , and glanced at his watch . “ i wonder if we ’ ve time to pick up cynthia . no , she ’ ll have started from the hospital by now . ”
christie	styles	“ cynthia ! that ’ s not your wife ? ” “ no , cynthia is a protégée of my mother ’ s , the daughter of an old schoolfellow of hers , who married a rascally solicitor . he came a cropper , and the girl was left an orphan and penniless . my mother came to the rescue , and cynthia has been with us nearly two years now . she works in the red cross hospital at tadminster , seven miles away . ”
christie	styles	as he spoke the last words , we drew up in front of the fine old house . a lady in a stout tweed skirt , who was bending over a flower bed , straightened herself at our approach .
christie	styles	“ hullo , evie , here ’ s our wounded hero ! mr. hastings—miss howard. ” miss howard shook hands with a hearty , almost painful , grip . i had an impression of very blue eyes in a sunburnt face . she was a pleasant-looking woman of about forty , with a deep voice , almost manly in its stentorian tones , and had a large sensible square body , with feet to match—these last encased in good thick boots . her conversation , i soon found , was couched in the telegraphic style .
christie	styles	“ weeds grow like house afire . can ’ t keep even with ’ em . shall press you in . better be careful. ” “ i ’ m sure i shall be only too delighted to make myself useful , ” i responded .
christie	styles	“ don ’ t say it . never does . wish you hadn ’ t later. ” “ you ’ re a cynic , evie , ” said john , laughing . “ where ’ s tea to-day—inside or out ? ” “ out . too fine a day to be cooped up in the house . ”
christie	styles	“ come on then , you ’ ve done enough gardening for to-day . ‘ the labourer is worthy of his hire ’ , you know . come and be refreshed. ” “ well , ” said miss howard , drawing off her gardening gloves , “ i ’ m inclined to agree with you . ”
christie	styles	she led the way round the house to where tea was spread under the shade of a large sycamore . a figure rose from one of the basket chairs , and came a few steps to meet us .
christie	styles	“ my wife , hastings , ” said john . i shall never forget my first sight of mary cavendish . her tall , slender form , outlined against the bright light ; the vivid sense of slumbering fire that seemed to find expression only in those wonderful tawny eyes of hers , remarkable eyes , different from any other woman ’ s that i have ever known ; the intense power of stillness she possessed , which nevertheless conveyed the impression of a wild untamed spirit in an exquisitely civilised body—all these things are burnt into my memory . i shall never forget them .
christie	styles	she greeted me with a few words of pleasant welcome in a low clear voice , and i sank into a basket chair feeling distinctly glad that i had accepted john ’ s invitation . mrs. cavendish gave me some tea , and her few quiet remarks heightened my first impression of her as a thoroughly fascinating woman . an appreciative listener is always stimulating , and i described , in a humorous manner , certain incidents of my convalescent home , in a way which , i flatter myself , greatly amused my hostess . john , of course , good fellow though he is , could hardly be called a brilliant conversationalist .
christie	styles	at that moment a well remembered voice floated through the open french window near at hand : “ then you ’ ll write to the princess after tea , alfred ? i ’ ll write to lady tadminster for the second day , myself . or shall we wait until we hear from the princess ? in case of a refusal , lady tadminster might open it the first day , and mrs. crosbie the second . then there ’ s the duchess—about the school fête . ”
christie	styles	there was the murmur of a man ’ s voice , and then mrs. inglethorp ’ s rose in reply : “ yes , certainly . after tea will do quite well . you are so thoughtful , alfred dear. ” the french window swung open a little wider , and a handsome white-haired old lady , with a somewhat masterful cast of features , stepped out of it on to the lawn . a man followed her , a suggestion of deference in his manner .
christie	styles	mrs. inglethorp greeted me with effusion . “ why , if it isn ’ t too delightful to see you again , mr. hastings , after all these years . alfred , darling , mr. hastings—my husband. ” i looked with some curiosity at “ alfred darling ” . he certainly struck a rather alien note . i did not wonder at john objecting to his beard . it was one of the longest and blackest i have ever seen . he wore gold-rimmed pince-nez , and had a curious impassivity of feature . it struck me that he might look natural on a stage , but was strangely out of place in real life . his voice was rather deep and unctuous . he placed a wooden hand in mine and said :
christie	styles	“ this is a pleasure , mr. hastings. ” then , turning to his wife : “ emily dearest , i think that cushion is a little damp. ” she beamed fondly on him , as he substituted another with every demonstration of the tenderest care . strange infatuation of an otherwise sensible woman !
christie	styles	with the presence of mr. inglethorp , a sense of constraint and veiled hostility seemed to settle down upon the company . miss howard , in particular , took no pains to conceal her feelings . mrs. inglethorp , however , seemed to notice nothing unusual . her volubility , which i remembered of old , had lost nothing in the intervening years , and she poured out a steady flood of conversation , mainly on the subject of the forthcoming bazaar which she was organizing and which was to take place shortly . occasionally she referred to her husband over a question of days or dates . his watchful and attentive manner never varied . from the very first i took a firm and rooted dislike to him , and i flatter myself that my first judgments are usually fairly shrewd .
christie	styles	presently mrs. inglethorp turned to give some instructions about letters to evelyn howard , and her husband addressed me in his painstaking voice : “ is soldiering your regular profession , mr. hastings ? ” “ no , before the war i was in lloyd ’ s . ”
christie	styles	“ and you will return there after it is over ? ” “ perhaps . either that or a fresh start altogether. ” mary cavendish leant forward . “ what would you really choose as a profession , if you could just consult your inclination ? ”
christie	styles	“ well , that depends. ” “ no secret hobby ? ” she asked . “ tell me—you ’ re drawn to something ? everyone is—usually something absurd. ” “ you ’ ll laugh at me. ” she smiled . “ perhaps. ” “ well , i ’ ve always had a secret hankering to be a detective ! ”
christie	styles	“ the real thing—scotland yard ? or sherlock holmes ? ” “ oh , sherlock holmes by all means . but really , seriously , i am awfully drawn to it . i came across a man in belgium once , a very famous detective , and he quite inflamed me . he was a marvellous little fellow . he used to say that all good detective work was a mere matter of method . my system is based on his—though of course i have progressed rather further . he was a funny little man , a great dandy , but wonderfully clever . ”
christie	styles	“ like a good detective story myself , ” remarked miss howard . “ lots of nonsense written , though . criminal discovered in last chapter . everyone dumbfounded . real crime—you ’ d know at once. ” “ there have been a great number of undiscovered crimes , ” i argued .
christie	styles	“ don ’ t mean the police , but the people that are right in it . the family . you couldn ’ t really hoodwink them . they ’ d know. ” “ then , ” i said , much amused , “ you think that if you were mixed up in a crime , say a murder , you ’ d be able to spot the murderer right off ? ”
christie	styles	“ of course i should . mightn ’ t be able to prove it to a pack of lawyers . but i ’ m certain i ’ d know . i ’ d feel it in my fingertips if he came near me . ”
christie	styles	“ it might be a ‘ she ’ , ” i suggested . “ might . but murder ’ s a violent crime . associate it more with a man. ” “ not in a case of poisoning. ” mrs. cavendish ’ s clear voice startled me . “ dr . bauerstein was saying yesterday that , owing to the general ignorance of the more uncommon poisons among the medical profession , there were probably countless cases of poisoning quite unsuspected . ”
christie	styles	“ why , mary , what a gruesome conversation ! ” cried mrs. inglethorp . “ it makes me feel as if a goose were walking over my grave . oh , there ’ s cynthia ! ” a young girl in v.a.d . uniform ran lightly across the lawn .
christie	styles	“ why , cynthia , you are late to-day . this is mr. hastings—miss murdoch. ” cynthia murdoch was a fresh-looking young creature , full of life and vigour . she tossed off her little v.a.d . cap , and i admired the great loose waves of her auburn hair , and the smallness and whiteness of the hand she held out to claim her tea . with dark eyes and eyelashes she would have been a beauty .
christie	styles	she flung herself down on the ground beside john , and as i handed her a plate of sandwiches she smiled up at me . “ sit down here on the grass , do . it ’ s ever so much nicer . ”
christie	styles	i dropped down obediently . “ you work at tadminster , don ’ t you , miss murdoch ? ” she nodded . “ for my sins. ” “ do they bully you , then ? ” i asked , smiling . “ i should like to see them ! ” cried cynthia with dignity .
christie	styles	“ i have got a cousin who is nursing , ” i remarked . “ and she is terrified of ‘ sisters ’ . ” “ i don ’ t wonder . sisters _are_ , you know , mr. hastings . they simp-ly _are_ ! you ’ ve no idea ! but i ’ m not a nurse , thank heaven , i work in the dispensary . ”
christie	styles	“ how many people do you poison ? ” i asked , smiling . cynthia smiled too . “ oh , hundreds ! ” she said . “ cynthia , ” called mrs. inglethorp , “ do you think you could write a few notes for me ? ”
christie	styles	“ certainly , aunt emily. ” she jumped up promptly , and something in her manner reminded me that her position was a dependent one , and that mrs. inglethorp , kind as she might be in the main , did not allow her to forget it .
christie	styles	my hostess turned to me . “ john will show you your room . supper is at half-past seven . we have given up late dinner for some time now . lady tadminster , our member ’ s wife—she was the late lord abbotsbury ’ s daughter—does the same . she agrees with me that one must set an example of economy . we are quite a war household ; nothing is wasted here—every scrap of waste paper , even , is saved and sent away in sacks . ”
christie	styles	i expressed my appreciation , and john took me into the house and up the broad staircase , which forked right and left half-way to different wings of the building . my room was in the left wing , and looked out over the park .
christie	styles	john left me , and a few minutes later i saw him from my window walking slowly across the grass arm in arm with cynthia murdoch . i heard mrs. inglethorp call “ cynthia ” impatiently , and the girl started and ran back to the house . at the same moment , a man stepped out from the shadow of a tree and walked slowly in the same direction . he looked about forty , very dark with a melancholy clean-shaven face . some violent emotion seemed to be mastering him . he looked up at my window as he passed , and i recognized him , though he had changed much in the fifteen years that had elapsed since we last met . it was john ’ s younger brother , lawrence cavendish . i wondered what it was that had brought that singular expression to his face .
christie	styles	then i dismissed him from my mind , and returned to the contemplation of my own affairs . the evening passed pleasantly enough ; and i dreamed that night of that enigmatical woman , mary cavendish .
christie	styles	the next morning dawned bright and sunny , and i was full of the anticipation of a delightful visit . i did not see mrs. cavendish until lunch-time , when she volunteered to take me for a walk , and we spent a charming afternoon roaming in the woods , returning to the house about five .
christie	styles	as we entered the large hall , john beckoned us both into the smoking-room . i saw at once by his face that something disturbing had occurred . we followed him in , and he shut the door after us .
christie	styles	“ look here , mary , there ’ s the deuce of a mess . evie ’ s had a row with alfred inglethorp , and she ’ s off. ” “ evie ? off ? ” john nodded gloomily . “ yes ; you see she went to the mater , and—oh , —here ’ s evie herself . ”
christie	styles	miss howard entered . her lips were set grimly together , and she carried a small suit-case . she looked excited and determined , and slightly on the defensive . “ at any rate , ” she burst out , “ i ’ ve spoken my mind ! ”
christie	styles	“ my dear evelyn , ” cried mrs. cavendish , “ this can ’ t be true ! ” miss howard nodded grimly . “ true enough ! afraid i said some things to emily she won ’ t forget or forgive in a hurry . don ’ t mind if they ’ ve only sunk in a bit . probably water off a duck ’ s back , though . i said right out : ‘ you ’ re an old woman , emily , and there ’ s no fool like an old fool . the man ’ s twenty years younger than you , and don ’ t you fool yourself as to what he married you for . money ! well , don ’ t let him have too much of it . farmer raikes has got a very pretty young wife . just ask your alfred how much time he spends over there. ’ she was very angry . natural ! i went on , ‘ i ’ m going to warn you , whether you like it or not . that man would as soon murder you in your bed as look at you . he ’ s a bad lot . you can say what you like to me , but remember what i ’ ve told you . he ’ s a bad lot ! ’ ”
christie	styles	“ what did she say ? ” miss howard made an extremely expressive grimace . “ ‘ darling alfred ’ — ‘ dearest alfred ’ — ‘ wicked calumnies ’ — ‘ wicked lies ’ — ‘ wicked woman ’ —to accuse her ‘ dear husband ! ’ the sooner i left her house the better . so i ’ m off . ”
christie	styles	“ but not now ? ” “ this minute ! ” for a moment we sat and stared at her . finally john cavendish , finding his persuasions of no avail , went off to look up the trains . his wife followed him , murmuring something about persuading mrs. inglethorp to think better of it .
christie	styles	as she left the room , miss howard ’ s face changed . she leant towards me eagerly . “ mr . hastings , you ’ re honest . i can trust you ? ” i was a little startled . she laid her hand on my arm , and sank her voice to a whisper .
christie	styles	“ look after her , mr. hastings . my poor emily . they ’ re a lot of sharks—all of them . oh , i know what i ’ m talking about . there isn ’ t one of them that ’ s not hard up and trying to get money out of her . i ’ ve protected her as much as i could . now i ’ m out of the way , they ’ ll impose upon her . ”
christie	styles	“ of course , miss howard , ” i said , “ i ’ ll do everything i can , but i ’ m sure you ’ re excited and overwrought. ” she interrupted me by slowly shaking her forefinger . “ young man , trust me . i ’ ve lived in the world rather longer than you have . all i ask you is to keep your eyes open . you ’ ll see what i mean . ”
christie	styles	the throb of the motor came through the open window , and miss howard rose and moved to the door . john ’ s voice sounded outside . with her hand on the handle , she turned her head over her shoulder , and beckoned to me .
christie	styles	“ above all , mr. hastings , watch that devil—her husband ! ” there was no time for more . miss howard was swallowed up in an eager chorus of protests and good-byes . the inglethorps did not appear .
christie	styles	as the motor drove away , mrs. cavendish suddenly detached herself from the group , and moved across the drive to the lawn to meet a tall bearded man who had been evidently making for the house . the colour rose in her cheeks as she held out her hand to him .
christie	styles	“ who is that ? ” i asked sharply , for instinctively i distrusted the man . “ that ’ s dr. bauerstein , ” said john shortly . “ and who is dr. bauerstein ? ” “ he ’ s staying in the village doing a rest cure , after a bad nervous breakdown . he ’ s a london specialist ; a very clever man—one of the greatest living experts on poisons , i believe . ”
christie	styles	“ and he ’ s a great friend of mary ’ s , ” put in cynthia , the irrepressible . john cavendish frowned and changed the subject . “ come for a stroll , hastings . this has been a most rotten business . she always had a rough tongue , but there is no stauncher friend in england than evelyn howard . ”
christie	styles	he took the path through the plantation , and we walked down to the village through the woods which bordered one side of the estate . as we passed through one of the gates on our way home again , a pretty young woman of gipsy type coming in the opposite direction bowed and smiled .
christie	styles	“ that ’ s a pretty girl , ” i remarked appreciatively . john ’ s face hardened . “ that is mrs. raikes. ” “ the one that miss howard—— ” “ exactly , ” said john , with rather unnecessary abruptness . i thought of the white-haired old lady in the big house , and that vivid wicked little face that had just smiled into ours , and a vague chill of foreboding crept over me . i brushed it aside .
christie	styles	“ styles is really a glorious old place , ” i said to john . he nodded rather gloomily . “ yes , it ’ s a fine property . it ’ ll be mine some day—should be mine now by rights , if my father had only made a decent will . and then i shouldn ’ t be so damned hard up as i am now . ”
christie	styles	“ hard up , are you ? ” “ my dear hastings , i don ’ t mind telling you that i ’ m at my wits ’ end for money. ” “ couldn ’ t your brother help you ? ” “ lawrence ? he ’ s gone through every penny he ever had , publishing rotten verses in fancy bindings . no , we ’ re an impecunious lot . my mother ’ s always been awfully good to us , i must say . that is , up to now . since her marriage , of course—— ” he broke off , frowning .
christie	styles	for the first time i felt that , with evelyn howard , something indefinable had gone from the atmosphere . her presence had spelt security . now that security was removed—and the air seemed rife with suspicion . the sinister face of dr. bauerstein recurred to me unpleasantly . a vague suspicion of everyone and everything filled my mind . just for a moment i had a premonition of approaching evil .
christie	styles	chapter ii . the 16th and 17th of july i had arrived at styles on the 5th of july . i come now to the events of the 16th and 17th of that month . for the convenience of the reader i will recapitulate the incidents of those days in as exact a manner as possible . they were elicited subsequently at the trial by a process of long and tedious cross-examinations .
christie	styles	i received a letter from evelyn howard a couple of days after her departure , telling me she was working as a nurse at the big hospital in middlingham , a manufacturing town some fifteen miles away , and begging me to let her know if mrs. inglethorp should show any wish to be reconciled .
christie	styles	the only fly in the ointment of my peaceful days was mrs. cavendish ’ s extraordinary , and , for my part , unaccountable preference for the society of dr. bauerstein . what she saw in the man i can not imagine , but she was always asking him up to the house , and often went off for long expeditions with him . i must confess that i was quite unable to see his attraction .
christie	styles	the 16th of july fell on a monday . it was a day of turmoil . the famous bazaar had taken place on saturday , and an entertainment , in connection with the same charity , at which mrs. inglethorp was to recite a war poem , was to be held that night . we were all busy during the morning arranging and decorating the hall in the village where it was to take place . we had a late luncheon and spent the afternoon resting in the garden . i noticed that john ’ s manner was somewhat unusual . he seemed very excited and restless .
christie	styles	after tea , mrs. inglethorp went to lie down to rest before her efforts in the evening and i challenged mary cavendish to a single at tennis . about a quarter to seven , mrs. inglethorp called us that we should be late as supper was early that night . we had rather a scramble to get ready in time ; and before the meal was over the motor was waiting at the door .
christie	styles	the entertainment was a great success , mrs. inglethorp ’ s recitation receiving tremendous applause . there were also some tableaux in which cynthia took part . she did not return with us , having been asked to a supper party , and to remain the night with some friends who had been acting with her in the tableaux .
christie	styles	the following morning , mrs. inglethorp stayed in bed to breakfast , as she was rather overtired ; but she appeared in her briskest mood about 12.30 , and swept lawrence and myself off to a luncheon party .
christie	styles	“ such a charming invitation from mrs. rolleston . lady tadminster ’ s sister , you know . the rollestons came over with the conqueror—one of our oldest families. ” mary had excused herself on the plea of an engagement with dr. bauerstein .
christie	styles	we had a pleasant luncheon , and as we drove away lawrence suggested that we should return by tadminster , which was barely a mile out of our way , and pay a visit to cynthia in her dispensary . mrs. inglethorp replied that this was an excellent idea , but as she had several letters to write she would drop us there , and we could come back with cynthia in the pony-trap .
christie	styles	we were detained under suspicion by the hospital porter , until cynthia appeared to vouch for us , looking very cool and sweet in her long white overall . she took us up to her sanctum , and introduced us to her fellow dispenser , a rather awe-inspiring individual , whom cynthia cheerily addressed as “ nibs . ”
christie	styles	“ what a lot of bottles ! ” i exclaimed , as my eye travelled round the small room . “ do you really know what ’ s in them all ? ” “ say something original , ” groaned cynthia . “ every single person who comes up here says that . we are really thinking of bestowing a prize on the first individual who does _not_ say : ‘ what a lot of bottles ! ’ and i know the next thing you ’ re going to say is : ‘ how many people have you poisoned ? ’ ”
christie	styles	i pleaded guilty with a laugh . “ if you people only knew how fatally easy it is to poison someone by mistake , you wouldn ’ t joke about it . come on , let ’ s have tea . we ’ ve got all sorts of secret stores in that cupboard . no , lawrence—that ’ s the poison cupboard . the big cupboard—that ’ s right . ”
christie	styles	we had a very cheery tea , and assisted cynthia to wash up afterwards . we had just put away the last tea-spoon when a knock came at the door . the countenances of cynthia and nibs were suddenly petrified into a stern and forbidding expression .
christie	styles	“ come in , ” said cynthia , in a sharp professional tone . a young and rather scared looking nurse appeared with a bottle which she proffered to nibs , who waved her towards cynthia with the somewhat enigmatical remark :
christie	styles	“ _i_ ’ m not really here to-day. ” cynthia took the bottle and examined it with the severity of a judge . “ this should have been sent up this morning. ” “ sister is very sorry . she forgot . ”
christie	styles	“ sister should read the rules outside the door. ” i gathered from the little nurse ’ s expression that there was not the least likelihood of her having the hardihood to retail this message to the dreaded “ sister ” .
christie	styles	“ so now it can ’ t be done until to-morrow , ” finished cynthia . “ don ’ t you think you could possibly let us have it to-night ? ” “ well , ” said cynthia graciously , “ we are very busy , but if we have time it shall be done . ”
christie	styles	the little nurse withdrew , and cynthia promptly took a jar from the shelf , refilled the bottle , and placed it on the table outside the door . i laughed . “ discipline must be maintained ? ”
christie	styles	“ exactly . come out on our little balcony . you can see all the outside wards there. ” i followed cynthia and her friend and they pointed out the different wards to me . lawrence remained behind , but after a few moments cynthia called to him over her shoulder to come and join us . then she looked at her watch .
christie	styles	“ nothing more to do , nibs ? ” “ no. ” “ all right . then we can lock up and go. ” i had seen lawrence in quite a different light that afternoon . compared to john , he was an astoundingly difficult person to get to know . he was the opposite of his brother in almost every respect , being unusually shy and reserved . yet he had a certain charm of manner , and i fancied that , if one really knew him well , one could have a deep affection for him . i had always fancied that his manner to cynthia was rather constrained , and that she on her side was inclined to be shy of him . but they were both gay enough this afternoon , and chatted together like a couple of children .
christie	styles	as we drove through the village , i remembered that i wanted some stamps , so accordingly we pulled up at the post office . as i came out again , i cannoned into a little man who was just entering . i drew aside and apologised , when suddenly , with a loud exclamation , he clasped me in his arms and kissed me warmly .
christie	styles	“ _mon ami_ hastings ! ” he cried . “ it is indeed _mon ami_ hastings ! ” “ poirot ! ” i exclaimed . i turned to the pony-trap . “ this is a very pleasant meeting for me , miss cynthia . this is my old friend , monsieur poirot , whom i have not seen for years . ”
christie	styles	“ oh , we know monsieur poirot , ” said cynthia gaily . “ but i had no idea he was a friend of yours. ” “ yes , indeed , ” said poirot seriously . “ i know mademoiselle cynthia . it is by the charity of that good mrs. inglethorp that i am here. ” then , as i looked at him inquiringly : “ yes , my friend , she had kindly extended hospitality to seven of my countrypeople who , alas , are refugees from their native land . we belgians will always remember her with gratitude . ”
christie	styles	poirot was an extraordinary looking little man . he was hardly more than five feet , four inches , but carried himself with great dignity . his head was exactly the shape of an egg , and he always perched it a little on one side . his moustache was very stiff and military . the neatness of his attire was almost incredible . i believe a speck of dust would have caused him more pain than a bullet wound . yet this quaint dandified little man who , i was sorry to see , now limped badly , had been in his time one of the most celebrated members of the belgian police . as a detective , his _flair_ had been extraordinary , and he had achieved triumphs by unravelling some of the most baffling cases of the day .
christie	styles	he pointed out to me the little house inhabited by him and his fellow belgians , and i promised to go and see him at an early date . then he raised his hat with a flourish to cynthia , and we drove away .
christie	styles	“ he ’ s a dear little man , ” said cynthia . “ i ’ d no idea you knew him. ” “ you ’ ve been entertaining a celebrity unawares , ” i replied . and , for the rest of the way home , i recited to them the various exploits and triumphs of hercule poirot .
christie	styles	we arrived back in a very cheerful mood . as we entered the hall , mrs. inglethorp came out of her boudoir . she looked flushed and upset . “ oh , it ’ s you , ” she said .
christie	styles	“ is there anything the matter , aunt emily ? ” asked cynthia . “ certainly not , ” said mrs. inglethorp sharply . “ what should there be ? ” then catching sight of dorcas , the parlourmaid , going into the dining-room , she called to her to bring some stamps into the boudoir .
christie	styles	“ yes , m ’ m. ” the old servant hesitated , then added diffidently : “ don ’ t you think , m ’ m , you ’ d better get to bed ? you ’ re looking very tired. ” “ perhaps you ’ re right , dorcas—yes—no—not now . i ’ ve some letters i must finish by post-time . have you lighted the fire in my room as i told you ? ”
christie	styles	“ yes , m ’ m. ” “ then i ’ ll go to bed directly after supper. ” she went into the boudoir again , and cynthia stared after her . “ goodness gracious ! i wonder what ’ s up ? ” she said to lawrence .
christie	styles	he did not seem to have heard her , for without a word he turned on his heel and went out of the house . i suggested a quick game of tennis before supper and , cynthia agreeing , i ran upstairs to fetch my racquet .
christie	styles	mrs. cavendish was coming down the stairs . it may have been my fancy , but she , too , was looking odd and disturbed . “ had a good walk with dr. bauerstein ? ” i asked , trying to appear as indifferent as i could .
christie	styles	“ i didn ’ t go , ” she replied abruptly . “ where is mrs. inglethorp ? ” “ in the boudoir. ” her hand clenched itself on the banisters , then she seemed to nerve herself for some encounter , and went rapidly past me down the stairs across the hall to the boudoir , the door of which she shut behind her .
christie	styles	as i ran out to the tennis court a few moments later , i had to pass the open boudoir window , and was unable to help overhearing the following scrap of dialogue . mary cavendish was saying in the voice of a woman desperately controlling herself :
christie	styles	“ then you won ’ t show it to me ? ” to which mrs. inglethorp replied : “ my dear mary , it has nothing to do with that matter. ” “ then show it to me. ” “ i tell you it is not what you imagine . it does not concern you in the least . ”
christie	styles	to which mary cavendish replied , with a rising bitterness : “ of course , i might have known you would shield him. ” cynthia was waiting for me , and greeted me eagerly with : “ i say ! there ’ s been the most awful row ! i ’ ve got it all out of dorcas . ”
christie	styles	“ what kind of a row ? ” “ between aunt emily and _him_ . i do hope she ’ s found him out at last ! ” “ was dorcas there , then ? ” “ of course not . she ‘ happened to be near the door ’ . it was a real old bust-up . i do wish i knew what it was all about . ”
christie	styles	i thought of mrs. raikes ’ s gipsy face , and evelyn howard ’ s warnings , but wisely decided to hold my peace , whilst cynthia exhausted every possible hypothesis , and cheerfully hoped , “ aunt emily will send him away , and will never speak to him again . ”
christie	styles	i was anxious to get hold of john , but he was nowhere to be seen . evidently something very momentous had occurred that afternoon . i tried to forget the few words i had overheard ; but , do what i would , i could not dismiss them altogether from my mind . what was mary cavendish ’ s concern in the matter ?
christie	styles	mr. inglethorp was in the drawing-room when i came down to supper . his face was impassive as ever , and the strange unreality of the man struck me afresh . mrs. inglethorp came down last . she still looked agitated , and during the meal there was a somewhat constrained silence . inglethorp was unusually quiet . as a rule , he surrounded his wife with little attentions , placing a cushion at her back , and altogether playing the part of the devoted husband . immediately after supper , mrs. inglethorp retired to her boudoir again .
christie	styles	“ send my coffee in here , mary , ” she called . “ i ’ ve just five minutes to catch the post. ” cynthia and i went and sat by the open window in the drawing-room . mary cavendish brought our coffee to us . she seemed excited .
christie	styles	“ do you young people want lights , or do you enjoy the twilight ? ” she asked . “ will you take mrs. inglethorp her coffee , cynthia ? i will pour it out. ” “ do not trouble , mary , ” said inglethorp . “ i will take it to emily. ” he poured it out , and went out of the room carrying it carefully .
christie	styles	lawrence followed him , and mrs. cavendish sat down by us . we three sat for some time in silence . it was a glorious night , hot and still . mrs. cavendish fanned herself gently with a palm leaf .
christie	styles	“ it ’ s almost too hot , ” she murmured . “ we shall have a thunderstorm. ” alas , that these harmonious moments can never endure ! my paradise was rudely shattered by the sound of a well known , and heartily disliked , voice in the hall .
christie	styles	“ dr . bauerstein ! ” exclaimed cynthia . “ what a funny time to come. ” i glanced jealously at mary cavendish , but she seemed quite undisturbed , the delicate pallor of her cheeks did not vary .
christie	styles	in a few moments , alfred inglethorp had ushered the doctor in , the latter laughing , and protesting that he was in no fit state for a drawing-room . in truth , he presented a sorry spectacle , being literally plastered with mud .
christie	styles	“ what have you been doing , doctor ? ” cried mrs. cavendish . “ i must make my apologies , ” said the doctor . “ i did not really mean to come in , but mr. inglethorp insisted. ” “ well , bauerstein , you are in a plight , ” said john , strolling in from the hall . “ have some coffee , and tell us what you have been up to . ”
christie	styles	“ thank you , i will. ” he laughed rather ruefully , as he described how he had discovered a very rare species of fern in an inaccessible place , and in his efforts to obtain it had lost his footing , and slipped ignominiously into a neighbouring pond .
christie	styles	“ the sun soon dried me off , ” he added , “ but i ’ m afraid my appearance is very disreputable. ” at this juncture , mrs. inglethorp called to cynthia from the hall , and the girl ran out .
christie	styles	“ just carry up my despatch-case , will you , dear ? i ’ m going to bed. ” the door into the hall was a wide one . i had risen when cynthia did , john was close by me . there were therefore three witnesses who could swear that mrs. inglethorp was carrying her coffee , as yet untasted , in her hand .
christie	styles	my evening was utterly and entirely spoilt by the presence of dr. bauerstein . it seemed to me the man would never go . he rose at last , however , and i breathed a sigh of relief .
christie	styles	“ i ’ ll walk down to the village with you , ” said mr. inglethorp . “ i must see our agent over those estate accounts. ” he turned to john . “ no one need sit up . i will take the latch-key . ”
christie	styles	chapter iii . the night of the tragedy to make this part of my story clear , i append the following plan of the first floor of styles . the servants ’ rooms are reached through the door b . they have no communication with the right wing , where the inglethorps ’ rooms were situated .
christie	styles	[ illustration ] it seemed to be the middle of the night when i was awakened by lawrence cavendish . he had a candle in his hand , and the agitation of his face told me at once that something was seriously wrong .
christie	styles	“ what ’ s the matter ? ” i asked , sitting up in bed , and trying to collect my scattered thoughts . “ we are afraid my mother is very ill. she seems to be having some kind of fit . unfortunately she has locked herself in . ”
christie	styles	“ i ’ ll come at once. ” i sprang out of bed ; and , pulling on a dressing-gown , followed lawrence along the passage and the gallery to the right wing of the house . john cavendish joined us , and one or two of the servants were standing round in a state of awe-stricken excitement . lawrence turned to his brother .
christie	styles	“ what do you think we had better do ? ” never , i thought , had his indecision of character been more apparent . john rattled the handle of mrs. inglethorp ’ s door violently , but with no effect . it was obviously locked or bolted on the inside . the whole household was aroused by now . the most alarming sounds were audible from the interior of the room . clearly something must be done .
christie	styles	“ try going through mr. inglethorp ’ s room , sir , ” cried dorcas . “ oh , the poor mistress ! ” suddenly i realized that alfred inglethorp was not with us—that he alone had given no sign of his presence . john opened the door of his room . it was pitch dark , but lawrence was following with the candle , and by its feeble light we saw that the bed had not been slept in , and that there was no sign of the room having been occupied .
christie	styles	we went straight to the connecting door . that , too , was locked or bolted on the inside . what was to be done ? “ oh , dear , sir , ” cried dorcas , wringing her hands , “ what ever shall we do ? ”
christie	styles	“ we must try and break the door in , i suppose . it ’ ll be a tough job , though . here , let one of the maids go down and wake baily and tell him to go for dr. wilkins at once . now then , we ’ ll have a try at the door . half a moment , though , isn ’ t there a door into miss cynthia ’ s rooms ? ”
christie	styles	“ yes , sir , but that ’ s always bolted . it ’ s never been undone. ” “ well , we might just see. ” he ran rapidly down the corridor to cynthia ’ s room . mary cavendish was there , shaking the girl—who must have been an unusually sound sleeper—and trying to wake her .
christie	styles	in a moment or two he was back . “ no good . that ’ s bolted too . we must break in the door . i think this one is a shade less solid than the one in the passage . ”
christie	styles	we strained and heaved together . the framework of the door was solid , and for a long time it resisted our efforts , but at last we felt it give beneath our weight , and finally , with a resounding crash , it was burst open .
christie	styles	we stumbled in together , lawrence still holding his candle . mrs. inglethorp was lying on the bed , her whole form agitated by violent convulsions , in one of which she must have overturned the table beside her . as we entered , however , her limbs relaxed , and she fell back upon the pillows .
christie	styles	john strode across the room , and lit the gas . turning to annie , one of the housemaids , he sent her downstairs to the dining-room for brandy . then he went across to his mother whilst i unbolted the door that gave on the corridor .
christie	styles	i turned to lawrence , to suggest that i had better leave them now that there was no further need of my services , but the words were frozen on my lips . never have i seen such a ghastly look on any man ’ s face . he was white as chalk , the candle he held in his shaking hand was sputtering onto the carpet , and his eyes , petrified with terror , or some such kindred emotion , stared fixedly over my head at a point on the further wall . it was as though he had seen something that turned him to stone . i instinctively followed the direction of his eyes , but i could see nothing unusual . the still feebly flickering ashes in the grate , and the row of prim ornaments on the mantelpiece , were surely harmless enough .
christie	styles	the violence of mrs. inglethorp ’ s attack seemed to be passing . she was able to speak in short gasps . “ better now—very sudden—stupid of me—to lock myself in. ” a shadow fell on the bed and , looking up , i saw mary cavendish standing near the door with her arm around cynthia . she seemed to be supporting the girl , who looked utterly dazed and unlike herself . her face was heavily flushed , and she yawned repeatedly .
christie	styles	“ poor cynthia is quite frightened , ” said mrs. cavendish in a low clear voice . she herself , i noticed , was dressed in her white land smock . then it must be later than i thought . i saw that a faint streak of daylight was showing through the curtains of the windows , and that the clock on the mantelpiece pointed to close upon five o ’ clock .
christie	styles	a strangled cry from the bed startled me . a fresh access of pain seized the unfortunate old lady . the convulsions were of a violence terrible to behold . everything was confusion . we thronged round her , powerless to help or alleviate . a final convulsion lifted her from the bed , until she appeared to rest upon her head and her heels , with her body arched in an extraordinary manner . in vain mary and john tried to administer more brandy . the moments flew . again the body arched itself in that peculiar fashion .
christie	styles	at that moment , dr. bauerstein pushed his way authoritatively into the room . for one instant he stopped dead , staring at the figure on the bed , and , at the same instant , mrs. inglethorp cried out in a strangled voice , her eyes fixed on the doctor :
christie	styles	“ alfred—alfred—— ” then she fell back motionless on the pillows . with a stride , the doctor reached the bed , and seizing her arms worked them energetically , applying what i knew to be artificial respiration . he issued a few short sharp orders to the servants . an imperious wave of his hand drove us all to the door . we watched him , fascinated , though i think we all knew in our hearts that it was too late , and that nothing could be done now . i could see by the expression on his face that he himself had little hope .
christie	styles	finally he abandoned his task , shaking his head gravely . at that moment , we heard footsteps outside , and dr. wilkins , mrs. inglethorp ’ s own doctor , a portly , fussy little man , came bustling in .
christie	styles	in a few words dr. bauerstein explained how he had happened to be passing the lodge gates as the car came out , and had run up to the house as fast as he could , whilst the car went on to fetch dr. wilkins . with a faint gesture of the hand , he indicated the figure on the bed .
christie	styles	“ ve—ry sad . ve—ry sad , ” murmured dr. wilkins . “ poor dear lady . always did far too much—far too much—against my advice . i warned her . her heart was far from strong . ‘ take it easy , ’ i said to her , ‘ take—it—easy ’ . but no—her zeal for good works was too great . nature rebelled . na—ture—re—belled . ”
christie	styles	dr. bauerstein , i noticed , was watching the local doctor narrowly . he still kept his eyes fixed on him as he spoke . “ the convulsions were of a peculiar violence , dr. wilkins . i am sorry you were not here in time to witness them . they were quite—tetanic in character . ”
christie	styles	“ ah ! ” said dr. wilkins wisely . “ i should like to speak to you in private , ” said dr. bauerstein . he turned to john . “ you do not object ? ” “ certainly not. ” we all trooped out into the corridor , leaving the two doctors alone , and i heard the key turned in the lock behind us .
christie	styles	we went slowly down the stairs . i was violently excited . i have a certain talent for deduction , and dr. bauerstein ’ s manner had started a flock of wild surmises in my mind . mary cavendish laid her hand upon my arm .
christie	styles	“ what is it ? why did dr. bauerstein seem so—peculiar ? ” i looked at her . “ do you know what i think ? ” “ what ? ” “ listen ! ” i looked round , the others were out of earshot . i lowered my voice to a whisper . “ i believe she has been poisoned ! i ’ m certain dr. bauerstein suspects it . ”
christie	styles	“ _what ? _ ” she shrank against the wall , the pupils of her eyes dilating wildly . then , with a sudden cry that startled me , she cried out : “ no , no—not that—not that ! ” and breaking from me , fled up the stairs . i followed her , afraid that she was going to faint . i found her leaning against the bannisters , deadly pale . she waved me away impatiently .
christie	styles	“ no , no—leave me . i ’ d rather be alone . let me just be quiet for a minute or two . go down to the others. ” i obeyed her reluctantly . john and lawrence were in the dining-room . i joined them . we were all silent , but i suppose i voiced the thoughts of us all when i at last broke it by saying :
christie	styles	“ where is mr. inglethorp ? ” john shook his head . “ he ’ s not in the house. ” our eyes met . where _was_ alfred inglethorp ? his absence was strange and inexplicable . i remembered mrs. inglethorp ’ s dying words . what lay beneath them ? what more could she have told us , if she had had time ?
christie	styles	at last we heard the doctors descending the stairs . dr. wilkins was looking important and excited , and trying to conceal an inward exultation under a manner of decorous calm . dr. bauerstein remained in the background , his grave bearded face unchanged . dr. wilkins was the spokesman for the two . he addressed himself to john :
christie	styles	“ mr . cavendish , i should like your consent to a post-mortem. ” “ is that necessary ? ” asked john gravely . a spasm of pain crossed his face . “ absolutely , ” said dr. bauerstein . “ you mean by that—— ? ”
christie	styles	“ that neither dr. wilkins nor myself could give a death certificate under the circumstances. ” john bent his head . “ in that case , i have no alternative but to agree. ” “ thank you , ” said dr. wilkins briskly . “ we propose that it should take place to-morrow night—or rather to-night. ” and he glanced at the daylight . “ under the circumstances , i am afraid an inquest can hardly be avoided—these formalities are necessary , but i beg that you won ’ t distress yourselves . ”
christie	styles	there was a pause , and then dr. bauerstein drew two keys from his pocket , and handed them to john . “ these are the keys of the two rooms . i have locked them and , in my opinion , they would be better kept locked for the present . ”
christie	styles	the doctors then departed . i had been turning over an idea in my head , and i felt that the moment had now come to broach it . yet i was a little chary of doing so . john , i knew , had a horror of any kind of publicity , and was an easygoing optimist , who preferred never to meet trouble half-way . it might be difficult to convince him of the soundness of my plan . lawrence , on the other hand , being less conventional , and having more imagination , i felt i might count upon as an ally . there was no doubt that the moment had come for me to take the lead .
christie	styles	“ john , ” i said , “ i am going to ask you something. ” “ well ? ” “ you remember my speaking of my friend poirot ? the belgian who is here ? he has been a most famous detective . ”
christie	styles	“ yes. ” “ i want you to let me call him in—to investigate this matter. ” “ what—now ? before the post-mortem ? ” “ yes , time is an advantage if—if—there has been foul play. ” “ rubbish ! ” cried lawrence angrily . “ in my opinion the whole thing is a mare ’ s nest of bauerstein ’ s ! wilkins hadn ’ t an idea of such a thing , until bauerstein put it into his head . but , like all specialists , bauerstein ’ s got a bee in his bonnet . poisons are his hobby , so of course he sees them everywhere . ”
christie	styles	i confess that i was surprised by lawrence ’ s attitude . he was so seldom vehement about anything . john hesitated . “ i can ’ t feel as you do , lawrence , ” he said at last . “ i ’ m inclined to give hastings a free hand , though i should prefer to wait a bit . we don ’ t want any unnecessary scandal . ”
christie	styles	“ no , no , ” i cried eagerly , “ you need have no fear of that . poirot is discretion itself. ” “ very well , then , have it your own way . i leave it in your hands . though , if it is as we suspect , it seems a clear enough case . god forgive me if i am wronging him ! ”
christie	styles	i looked at my watch . it was six o ’ clock . i determined to lose no time . five minutes ’ delay , however , i allowed myself . i spent it in ransacking the library until i discovered a medical book which gave a description of strychnine poisoning .
christie	styles	chapter iv . poirot investigates the house which the belgians occupied in the village was quite close to the park gates . one could save time by taking a narrow path through the long grass , which cut off the detours of the winding drive . so i , accordingly , went that way . i had nearly reached the lodge , when my attention was arrested by the running figure of a man approaching me . it was mr. inglethorp . where had he been ? how did he intend to explain his absence ?
christie	styles	he accosted me eagerly . “ my god ! this is terrible ! my poor wife ! i have only just heard. ” “ where have you been ? ” i asked . “ denby kept me late last night . it was one o ’ clock before we ’ d finished . then i found that i ’ d forgotten the latch-key after all . i didn ’ t want to arouse the household , so denby gave me a bed . ”
christie	styles	“ how did you hear the news ? ” i asked . “ wilkins knocked denby up to tell him . my poor emily ! she was so self-sacrificing—such a noble character . she over-taxed her strength. ” a wave of revulsion swept over me . what a consummate hypocrite the man was !
christie	styles	“ i must hurry on , ” i said , thankful that he did not ask me whither i was bound . in a few minutes i was knocking at the door of leastways cottage .
christie	styles	getting no answer , i repeated my summons impatiently . a window above me was cautiously opened , and poirot himself looked out . he gave an exclamation of surprise at seeing me . in a few brief words , i explained the tragedy that had occurred , and that i wanted his help .
christie	styles	“ wait , my friend , i will let you in , and you shall recount to me the affair whilst i dress. ” in a few moments he had unbarred the door , and i followed him up to his room . there he installed me in a chair , and i related the whole story , keeping back nothing , and omitting no circumstance , however insignificant , whilst he himself made a careful and deliberate toilet .
christie	styles	i told him of my awakening , of mrs. inglethorp ’ s dying words , of her husband ’ s absence , of the quarrel the day before , of the scrap of conversation between mary and her mother-in-law that i had overheard , of the former quarrel between mrs. inglethorp and evelyn howard , and of the latter ’ s innuendoes .
christie	styles	i was hardly as clear as i could wish . i repeated myself several times , and occasionally had to go back to some detail that i had forgotten . poirot smiled kindly on me .
christie	styles	“ the mind is confused ? is it not so ? take time , _mon ami_ . you are agitated ; you are excited—it is but natural . presently , when we are calmer , we will arrange the facts , neatly , each in his proper place . we will examine—and reject . those of importance we will put on one side ; those of no importance , pouf ! ” —he screwed up his cherub-like face , and puffed comically enough— “ blow them away ! ”
christie	styles	“ that ’ s all very well , ” i objected , “ but how are you going to decide what is important , and what isn ’ t ? that always seems the difficulty to me. ” poirot shook his head energetically . he was now arranging his moustache with exquisite care .
christie	styles	“ not so . _voyons ! _ one fact leads to another—so we continue . does the next fit in with that ? _a merveille ! _ good ! we can proceed . this next little fact—no ! ah , that is curious ! there is something missing—a link in the chain that is not there . we examine . we search . and that little curious fact , that possibly paltry little detail that will not tally , we put it here ! ” he made an extravagant gesture with his hand . “ it is significant ! it is tremendous ! ”
christie	styles	“ y—es—— ” “ ah ! ” poirot shook his forefinger so fiercely at me that i quailed before it . “ beware ! peril to the detective who says : ‘ it is so small—it does not matter . it will not agree . i will forget it. ’ that way lies confusion ! everything matters . ”
christie	styles	“ i know . you always told me that . that ’ s why i have gone into all the details of this thing whether they seemed to me relevant or not. ” “ and i am pleased with you . you have a good memory , and you have given me the facts faithfully . of the order in which you present them , i say nothing—truly , it is deplorable ! but i make allowances—you are upset . to that i attribute the circumstance that you have omitted one fact of paramount importance . ”
christie	styles	“ what is that ? ” i asked . “ you have not told me if mrs. inglethorp ate well last night. ” i stared at him . surely the war had affected the little man ’ s brain . he was carefully engaged in brushing his coat before putting it on , and seemed wholly engrossed in the task .
christie	styles	“ i don ’ t remember , ” i said . “ and , anyway , i don ’ t see—— ” “ you do not see ? but it is of the first importance. ” “ i can ’ t see why , ” i said , rather nettled . “ as far as i can remember , she didn ’ t eat much . she was obviously upset , and it had taken her appetite away . that was only natural . ”
christie	styles	“ yes , ” said poirot thoughtfully , “ it was only natural. ” he opened a drawer , and took out a small despatch-case , then turned to me . “ now i am ready . we will proceed to the château , and study matters on the spot . excuse me , _mon ami_ , you dressed in haste , and your tie is on one side . permit me. ” with a deft gesture , he rearranged it .
christie	styles	“ _ça y est ! _ now , shall we start ? ” we hurried up the village , and turned in at the lodge gates . poirot stopped for a moment , and gazed sorrowfully over the beautiful expanse of park , still glittering with morning dew .
christie	styles	“ so beautiful , so beautiful , and yet , the poor family , plunged in sorrow , prostrated with grief. ” he looked at me keenly as he spoke , and i was aware that i reddened under his prolonged gaze .
christie	styles	was the family prostrated by grief ? was the sorrow at mrs. inglethorp ’ s death so great ? i realized that there was an emotional lack in the atmosphere . the dead woman had not the gift of commanding love . her death was a shock and a distress , but she would not be passionately regretted .
christie	styles	poirot seemed to follow my thoughts . he nodded his head gravely . “ no , you are right , ” he said , “ it is not as though there was a blood tie . she has been kind and generous to these cavendishes , but she was not their own mother . blood tells—always remember that—blood tells . ”
christie	styles	“ poirot , ” i said , “ i wish you would tell me why you wanted to know if mrs. inglethorp ate well last night ? i have been turning it over in my mind , but i can ’ t see how it has anything to do with the matter ? ”
christie	styles	he was silent for a minute or two as we walked along , but finally he said : “ i do not mind telling you—though , as you know , it is not my habit to explain until the end is reached . the present contention is that mrs. inglethorp died of strychnine poisoning , presumably administered in her coffee . ”
christie	styles	“ yes ? ” “ well , what time was the coffee served ? ” “ about eight o ’ clock. ” “ therefore she drank it between then and half-past eight—certainly not much later . well , strychnine is a fairly rapid poison . its effects would be felt very soon , probably in about an hour . yet , in mrs. inglethorp ’ s case , the symptoms do not manifest themselves until five o ’ clock the next morning : nine hours ! but a heavy meal , taken at about the same time as the poison , might retard its effects , though hardly to that extent . still , it is a possibility to be taken into account . but , according to you , she ate very little for supper , and yet the symptoms do not develop until early the next morning ! now that is a curious circumstance , my friend . something may arise at the autopsy to explain it . in the meantime , remember it . ”
christie	styles	as we neared the house , john came out and met us . his face looked weary and haggard . “ this is a very dreadful business , monsieur poirot , ” he said . “ hastings has explained to you that we are anxious for no publicity ? ”
christie	styles	“ i comprehend perfectly. ” “ you see , it is only suspicion so far . we have nothing to go upon. ” “ precisely . it is a matter of precaution only. ” john turned to me , taking out his cigarette-case , and lighting a cigarette as he did so .
christie	styles	“ you know that fellow inglethorp is back ? ” “ yes . i met him. ” john flung the match into an adjacent flower bed , a proceeding which was too much for poirot ’ s feelings . he retrieved it , and buried it neatly .
christie	styles	“ it ’ s jolly difficult to know how to treat him. ” “ that difficulty will not exist long , ” pronounced poirot quietly . john looked puzzled , not quite understanding the portent of this cryptic saying . he handed the two keys which dr. bauerstein had given him to me .
christie	styles	“ show monsieur poirot everything he wants to see. ” “ the rooms are locked ? ” asked poirot . “ dr . bauerstein considered it advisable. ” poirot nodded thoughtfully . “ then he is very sure . well , that simplifies matters for us . ”
christie	styles	we went up together to the room of the tragedy . for convenience i append a plan of the room and the principal articles of furniture in it . [ illustration ] poirot locked the door on the inside , and proceeded to a minute inspection of the room . he darted from one object to the other with the agility of a grasshopper . i remained by the door , fearing to obliterate any clues . poirot , however , did not seem grateful to me for my forbearance .
christie	styles	“ what have you , my friend , ” he cried , “ that you remain there like—how do you say it ? —ah , yes , the stuck pig ? ” i explained that i was afraid of obliterating any foot-marks .
christie	styles	“ foot-marks ? but what an idea ! there has already been practically an army in the room ! what foot-marks are we likely to find ? no , come here and aid me in my search . i will put down my little case until i need it . ”
christie	styles	he did so , on the round table by the window , but it was an ill-advised proceeding ; for , the top of it being loose , it tilted up , and precipitated the despatch-case on the floor .
christie	styles	“ _eh voilà une table ! _ ” cried poirot . “ ah , my friend , one may live in a big house and yet have no comfort. ” after which piece of moralizing , he resumed his search .
christie	styles	a small purple despatch-case , with a key in the lock , on the writing-table , engaged his attention for some time . he took out the key from the lock , and passed it to me to inspect . i saw nothing peculiar , however . it was an ordinary key of the yale type , with a bit of twisted wire through the handle .
christie	styles	next , he examined the framework of the door we had broken in , assuring himself that the bolt had really been shot . then he went to the door opposite leading into cynthia ’ s room . that door was also bolted , as i had stated . however , he went to the length of unbolting it , and opening and shutting it several times ; this he did with the utmost precaution against making any noise . suddenly something in the bolt itself seemed to rivet his attention . he examined it carefully , and then , nimbly whipping out a pair of small forceps from his case , he drew out some minute particle which he carefully sealed up in a tiny envelope .
christie	styles	on the chest of drawers there was a tray with a spirit lamp and a small saucepan on it . a small quantity of a dark fluid remained in the saucepan , and an empty cup and saucer that had been drunk out of stood near it .
christie	styles	i wondered how i could have been so unobservant as to overlook this . here was a clue worth having . poirot delicately dipped his finger into liquid , and tasted it gingerly . he made a grimace .
christie	styles	“ cocoa—with—i think—rum in it. ” he passed on to the debris on the floor , where the table by the bed had been overturned . a reading-lamp , some books , matches , a bunch of keys , and the crushed fragments of a coffee-cup lay scattered about .
christie	styles	“ ah , this is curious , ” said poirot . “ i must confess that i see nothing particularly curious about it. ” “ you do not ? observe the lamp—the chimney is broken in two places ; they lie there as they fell . but see , the coffee-cup is absolutely smashed to powder . ”
christie	styles	“ well , ” i said wearily , “ i suppose someone must have stepped on it. ” “ exactly , ” said poirot , in an odd voice . “ someone stepped on it. ” he rose from his knees , and walked slowly across to the mantelpiece , where he stood abstractedly fingering the ornaments , and straightening them—a trick of his when he was agitated .
christie	styles	“ _mon ami_ , ” he said , turning to me , “ somebody stepped on that cup , grinding it to powder , and the reason they did so was either because it contained strychnine or—which is far more serious—because it did not contain strychnine ! ”
christie	styles	i made no reply . i was bewildered , but i knew that it was no good asking him to explain . in a moment or two he roused himself , and went on with his investigations . he picked up the bunch of keys from the floor , and twirling them round in his fingers finally selected one , very bright and shining , which he tried in the lock of the purple despatch-case . it fitted , and he opened the box , but after a moment ’ s hesitation , closed and relocked it , and slipped the bunch of keys , as well as the key that had originally stood in the lock , into his own pocket .
christie	styles	“ i have no authority to go through these papers . but it should be done—at once ! ” he then made a very careful examination of the drawers of the wash-stand . crossing the room to the left-hand window , a round stain , hardly visible on the dark brown carpet , seemed to interest him particularly . he went down on his knees , examining it minutely—even going so far as to smell it .
christie	styles	finally , he poured a few drops of the cocoa into a test tube , sealing it up carefully . his next proceeding was to take out a little notebook . “ we have found in this room , ” he said , writing busily , “ six points of interest . shall i enumerate them , or will you ? ”
christie	styles	“ oh , you , ” i replied hastily . “ very well , then . one , a coffee-cup that has been ground into powder ; two , a despatch-case with a key in the lock ; three , a stain on the floor . ”
christie	styles	“ that may have been done some time ago , ” i interrupted . “ no , for it is still perceptibly damp and smells of coffee . four , a fragment of some dark green fabric—only a thread or two , but recognizable . ”
christie	styles	“ ah ! ” i cried . “ that was what you sealed up in the envelope. ” “ yes . it may turn out to be a piece of one of mrs. inglethorp ’ s own dresses , and quite unimportant . we shall see . five , _this_ ! ” with a dramatic gesture , he pointed to a large splash of candle grease on the floor by the writing-table . “ it must have been done since yesterday , otherwise a good housemaid would have at once removed it with blotting-paper and a hot iron . one of my best hats once—but that is not to the point . ”
christie	styles	“ it was very likely done last night . we were very agitated . or perhaps mrs. inglethorp herself dropped her candle. ” “ you brought only one candle into the room ? ” “ yes . lawrence cavendish was carrying it . but he was very upset . he seemed to see something over here ” —i indicated the mantelpiece— “ that absolutely paralysed him . ”
christie	styles	“ that is interesting , ” said poirot quickly . “ yes , it is suggestive ” —his eye sweeping the whole length of the wall— “ but it was not his candle that made this great patch , for you perceive that this is white grease ; whereas monsieur lawrence ’ s candle , which is still on the dressing-table , is pink . on the other hand , mrs. inglethorp had no candlestick in the room , only a reading-lamp . ”
christie	styles	“ then , ” i said , “ what do you deduce ? ” to which my friend only made a rather irritating reply , urging me to use my own natural faculties . “ and the sixth point ? ” i asked . “ i suppose it is the sample of cocoa . ”
christie	styles	“ no , ” said poirot thoughtfully . “ i might have included that in the six , but i did not . no , the sixth point i will keep to myself for the present. ” he looked quickly round the room . “ there is nothing more to be done here , i think , unless ” —he stared earnestly and long at the dead ashes in the grate . “ the fire burns—and it destroys . but by chance—there might be—let us see ! ”
christie	styles	deftly , on hands and knees , he began to sort the ashes from the grate into the fender , handling them with the greatest caution . suddenly , he gave a faint exclamation . “ the forceps , hastings ! ”
christie	styles	i quickly handed them to him , and with skill he extracted a small piece of half charred paper . “ there , _mon ami ! _ ” he cried . “ what do you think of that ? ” i scrutinized the fragment . this is an exact reproduction of it : —
christie	styles	[ illustration ] i was puzzled . it was unusually thick , quite unlike ordinary notepaper . suddenly an idea struck me . “ poirot ! ” i cried . “ this is a fragment of a will ! ” “ exactly. ” i looked up at him sharply .
christie	styles	“ you are not surprised ? ” “ no , ” he said gravely , “ i expected it. ” i relinquished the piece of paper , and watched him put it away in his case , with the same methodical care that he bestowed on everything . my brain was in a whirl . what was this complication of a will ? who had destroyed it ? the person who had left the candle grease on the floor ? obviously . but how had anyone gained admission ? all the doors had been bolted on the inside .
christie	styles	“ now , my friend , ” said poirot briskly , “ we will go . i should like to ask a few questions of the parlourmaid—dorcas , her name is , is it not ? ” we passed through alfred inglethorp ’ s room , and poirot delayed long enough to make a brief but fairly comprehensive examination of it . we went out through that door , locking both it and that of mrs. inglethorp ’ s room as before .
christie	styles	i took him down to the boudoir which he had expressed a wish to see , and went myself in search of dorcas . when i returned with her , however , the boudoir was empty .
christie	styles	“ poirot , ” i cried , “ where are you ? ” “ i am here , my friend. ” he had stepped outside the french window , and was standing , apparently lost in admiration , before the various shaped flower beds .
christie	styles	“ admirable ! ” he murmured . “ admirable ! what symmetry ! observe that crescent ; and those diamonds—their neatness rejoices the eye . the spacing of the plants , also , is perfect . it has been recently done ; is it not so ? ”
christie	styles	“ yes , i believe they were at it yesterday afternoon . but come in—dorcas is here. ” “ _eh bien , eh bien ! _ do not grudge me a moment ’ s satisfaction of the eye. ” “ yes , but this affair is more important . ”
christie	styles	“ and how do you know that these fine begonias are not of equal importance ? ” i shrugged my shoulders . there was really no arguing with him if he chose to take that line .
christie	styles	“ you do not agree ? but such things have been . well , we will come in and interview the brave dorcas. ” dorcas was standing in the boudoir , her hands folded in front of her , and her grey hair rose in stiff waves under her white cap . she was the very model and picture of a good old-fashioned servant .
christie	styles	in her attitude towards poirot , she was inclined to be suspicious , but he soon broke down her defences . he drew forward a chair . “ pray be seated , mademoiselle. ” “ thank you , sir . ”
christie	styles	“ you have been with your mistress many years , is it not so ? ” “ ten years , sir. ” “ that is a long time , and very faithful service . you were much attached to her , were you not ? ”
christie	styles	“ she was a very good mistress to me , sir. ” “ then you will not object to answering a few questions . i put them to you with mr. cavendish ’ s full approval. ” “ oh , certainly , sir . ”
christie	styles	“ then i will begin by asking you about the events of yesterday afternoon . your mistress had a quarrel ? ” “ yes , sir . but i don ’ t know that i ought—— ” dorcas hesitated . poirot looked at her keenly .
christie	styles	“ my good dorcas , it is necessary that i should know every detail of that quarrel as fully as possible . do not think that you are betraying your mistress ’ s secrets . your mistress lies dead , and it is necessary that we should know all—if we are to avenge her . nothing can bring her back to life , but we do hope , if there has been foul play , to bring the murderer to justice . ”
christie	styles	“ amen to that , ” said dorcas fiercely . “ and , naming no names , there ’ s _one_ in this house that none of us could ever abide ! and an ill day it was when first _he_ darkened the threshold . ”
christie	styles	poirot waited for her indignation to subside , and then , resuming his business-like tone , he asked : “ now , as to this quarrel ? what is the first you heard of it ? ” “ well , sir , i happened to be going along the hall outside yesterday—— ”
christie	styles	“ what time was that ? ” “ i couldn ’ t say exactly , sir , but it wasn ’ t tea-time by a long way . perhaps four o ’ clock—or it may have been a bit later . well , sir , as i said , i happened to be passing along , when i heard voices very loud and angry in here . i didn ’ t exactly mean to listen , but—well , there it is . i stopped . the door was shut , but the mistress was speaking very sharp and clear , and i heard what she said quite plainly . ‘ you have lied to me , and deceived me , ’ she said . i didn ’ t hear what mr. inglethorp replied . he spoke a good bit lower than she did—but she answered : ‘ how dare you ? i have kept you and clothed you and fed you ! you owe everything to me ! and this is how you repay me ! by bringing disgrace upon our name ! ’ again i didn ’ t hear what he said , but she went on : ‘ nothing that you can say will make any difference . i see my duty clearly . my mind is made up . you need not think that any fear of publicity , or scandal between husband and wife will deter me. ’ then i thought i heard them coming out , so i went off quickly . ”
christie	styles	“ you are sure it was mr. inglethorp ’ s voice you heard ? ” “ oh , yes , sir , whose else ’ s could it be ? ” “ well , what happened next ? ” “ later , i came back to the hall ; but it was all quiet . at five o ’ clock , mrs. inglethorp rang the bell and told me to bring her a cup of tea—nothing to eat—to the boudoir . she was looking dreadful—so white and upset . ‘ dorcas , ’ she says , ‘ i ’ ve had a great shock. ’ ‘ i ’ m sorry for that , m ’ m , ’ i says . ‘ you ’ ll feel better after a nice hot cup of tea , m ’ m. ’ she had something in her hand . i don ’ t know if it was a letter , or just a piece of paper , but it had writing on it , and she kept staring at it , almost as if she couldn ’ t believe what was written there . she whispered to herself , as though she had forgotten i was there : ‘ these few words—and everything ’ s changed. ’ and then she says to me : ‘ never trust a man , dorcas , they ’ re not worth it ! ’ i hurried off , and got her a good strong cup of tea , and she thanked me , and said she ’ d feel better when she ’ d drunk it . ‘ i don ’ t know what to do , ’ she says . ‘ scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing , dorcas . i ’ d rather hush it up if i could. ’ mrs. cavendish came in just then , so she didn ’ t say any more . ”
christie	styles	“ she still had the letter , or whatever it was , in her hand ? ” “ yes , sir. ” “ what would she be likely to do with it afterwards ? ” “ well , i don ’ t know , sir , i expect she would lock it up in that purple case of hers . ”
christie	styles	“ is that where she usually kept important papers ? ” “ yes , sir . she brought it down with her every morning , and took it up every night. ” “ when did she lose the key of it ? ”
christie	styles	“ she missed it yesterday at lunch-time , sir , and told me to look carefully for it . she was very much put out about it. ” “ but she had a duplicate key ? ” “ oh , yes , sir . ”
christie	styles	dorcas was looking very curiously at him and , to tell the truth , so was i . what was all this about a lost key ? poirot smiled . “ never mind , dorcas , it is my business to know things . is this the key that was lost ? ” he drew from his pocket the key that he had found in the lock of the despatch-case upstairs .
christie	styles	dorcas ’ s eyes looked as though they would pop out of her head . “ that ’ s it , sir , right enough . but where did you find it ? i looked everywhere for it. ” “ ah , but you see it was not in the same place yesterday as it was to-day . now , to pass to another subject , had your mistress a dark green dress in her wardrobe ? ”
christie	styles	dorcas was rather startled by the unexpected question . “ no , sir. ” “ are you quite sure ? ” “ oh , yes , sir. ” “ has anyone else in the house got a green dress ? ” dorcas reflected . “ miss cynthia has a green evening dress . ”
christie	styles	“ light or dark green ? ” “ a light green , sir ; a sort of chiffon , they call it. ” “ ah , that is not what i want . and nobody else has anything green ? ” “ no , sir—not that i know of . ”
christie	styles	poirot ’ s face did not betray a trace of whether he was disappointed or otherwise . he merely remarked : “ good , we will leave that and pass on . have you any reason to believe that your mistress was likely to take a sleeping powder last night ? ”
christie	styles	“ not _last_ night , sir , i know she didn ’ t. ” “ why do you know so positively ? ” “ because the box was empty . she took the last one two days ago , and she didn ’ t have any more made up . ”
christie	styles	“ you are quite sure of that ? ” “ positive , sir. ” “ then that is cleared up ! by the way , your mistress didn ’ t ask you to sign any paper yesterday ? ” “ to sign a paper ? no , sir . ”
christie	styles	“ when mr. hastings and mr. lawrence came in yesterday evening , they found your mistress busy writing letters . i suppose you can give me no idea to whom these letters were addressed ? ”
christie	styles	“ i ’ m afraid i couldn ’ t , sir . i was out in the evening . perhaps annie could tell you , though she ’ s a careless girl . never cleared the coffee-cups away last night . that ’ s what happens when i ’ m not here to look after things . ”
christie	styles	poirot lifted his hand . “ since they have been left , dorcas , leave them a little longer , i pray you . i should like to examine them. ” “ very well , sir. ” “ what time did you go out last evening ? ”
christie	styles	“ about six o ’ clock , sir. ” “ thank you , dorcas , that is all i have to ask you. ” he rose and strolled to the window . “ i have been admiring these flower beds . how many gardeners are employed here , by the way ? ”
christie	styles	“ only three now , sir . five , we had , before the war , when it was kept as a gentleman ’ s place should be . i wish you could have seen it then , sir . a fair sight it was . but now there ’ s only old manning , and young william , and a new-fashioned woman gardener in breeches and such-like . ah , these are dreadful times ! ”
christie	styles	“ the good times will come again , dorcas . at least , we hope so . now , will you send annie to me here ? ” “ yes , sir . thank you , sir. ” “ how did you know that mrs. inglethorp took sleeping powders ? ” i asked , in lively curiosity , as dorcas left the room . “ and about the lost key and the duplicate ? ”
christie	styles	“ one thing at a time . as to the sleeping powders , i knew by this. ” he suddenly produced a small cardboard box , such as chemists use for powders . “ where did you find it ? ”
christie	styles	“ in the wash-stand drawer in mrs. inglethorp ’ s bedroom . it was number six of my catalogue. ” “ but i suppose , as the last powder was taken two days ago , it is not of much importance ? ”
christie	styles	“ probably not , but do you notice anything that strikes you as peculiar about this box ? ” i examined it closely . “ no , i can ’ t say that i do. ” “ look at the label . ”
christie	styles	i read the label carefully : “ ‘ one powder to be taken at bedtime , if required . mrs. inglethorp. ’ no , i see nothing unusual. ” “ not the fact that there is no chemist ’ s name ? ”
christie	styles	“ ah ! ” i exclaimed . “ to be sure , that is odd ! ” “ have you ever known a chemist to send out a box like that , without his printed name ? ” “ no , i can ’ t say that i have . ”
christie	styles	i was becoming quite excited , but poirot damped my ardour by remarking : “ yet the explanation is quite simple . so do not intrigue yourself , my friend. ” an audible creaking proclaimed the approach of annie , so i had no time to reply .
christie	styles	annie was a fine , strapping girl , and was evidently labouring under intense excitement , mingled with a certain ghoulish enjoyment of the tragedy . poirot came to the point at once , with a business-like briskness .
christie	styles	“ i sent for you , annie , because i thought you might be able to tell me something about the letters mrs. inglethorp wrote last night . how many were there ? and can you tell me any of the names and addresses ? ”
christie	styles	annie considered . “ there were four letters , sir . one was to miss howard , and one was to mr. wells , the lawyer , and the other two i don ’ t think i remember , sir—oh , yes , one was to ross ’ s , the caterers in tadminster . the other one , i don ’ t remember . ”
christie	styles	“ think , ” urged poirot . annie racked her brains in vain . “ i ’ m sorry , sir , but it ’ s clean gone . i don ’ t think i can have noticed it. ” “ it does not matter , ” said poirot , not betraying any sign of disappointment . “ now i want to ask you about something else . there is a saucepan in mrs. inglethorp ’ s room with some cocoa in it . did she have that every night ? ”
christie	styles	“ yes , sir , it was put in her room every evening , and she warmed it up in the night—whenever she fancied it. ” “ what was it ? plain cocoa ? ” “ yes , sir , made with milk , with a teaspoonful of sugar , and two teaspoonfuls of rum in it . ”
christie	styles	“ who took it to her room ? ” “ i did , sir. ” “ always ? ” “ yes , sir. ” “ at what time ? ” “ when i went to draw the curtains , as a rule , sir. ” “ did you bring it straight up from the kitchen then ? ”
christie	styles	“ no , sir , you see there ’ s not much room on the gas stove , so cook used to make it early , before putting the vegetables on for supper . then i used to bring it up , and put it on the table by the swing door , and take it into her room later . ”
christie	styles	“ the swing door is in the left wing , is it not ? ” “ yes , sir. ” “ and the table , is it on this side of the door , or on the farther—servants ’ side ? ” “ it ’ s this side , sir . ”
christie	styles	“ what time did you bring it up last night ? ” “ about quarter-past seven , i should say , sir. ” “ and when did you take it into mrs. inglethorp ’ s room ? ” “ when i went to shut up , sir . about eight o ’ clock . mrs. inglethorp came up to bed before i ’ d finished . ”
christie	styles	“ then , between seven-fifteen and eight o ’ clock , the cocoa was standing on the table in the left wing ? ” “ yes , sir. ” annie had been growing redder and redder in the face , and now she blurted out unexpectedly :
christie	styles	“ and if there _was_ salt in it , sir , it wasn ’ t me . i never took the salt near it. ” “ what makes you think there was salt in it ? ” asked poirot . “ seeing it on the tray , sir . ”
christie	styles	“ you saw some salt on the tray ? ” “ yes . coarse kitchen salt , it looked . i never noticed it when i took the tray up , but when i came to take it into the mistress ’ s room i saw it at once , and i suppose i ought to have taken it down again , and asked cook to make some fresh . but i was in a hurry , because dorcas was out , and i thought maybe the cocoa itself was all right , and the salt had only gone on the tray . so i dusted it off with my apron , and took it in . ”
christie	styles	i had the utmost difficulty in controlling my excitement . unknown to herself , annie had provided us with an important piece of evidence . how she would have gaped if she had realized that her “ coarse kitchen salt ” was strychnine , one of the most deadly poisons known to mankind . i marvelled at poirot ’ s calm . his self-control was astonishing . i awaited his next question with impatience , but it disappointed me .
christie	styles	“ when you went into mrs. inglethorp ’ s room , was the door leading into miss cynthia ’ s room bolted ? ” “ oh ! yes , sir ; it always was . it had never been opened. ” “ and the door into mr. inglethorp ’ s room ? did you notice if that was bolted too ? ”
christie	styles	annie hesitated . “ i couldn ’ t rightly say , sir ; it was shut but i couldn ’ t say whether it was bolted or not. ” “ when you finally left the room , did mrs. inglethorp bolt the door after you ? ”
christie	styles	“ no , sir , not then , but i expect she did later . she usually did lock it at night . the door into the passage , that is. ” “ did you notice any candle grease on the floor when you did the room yesterday ? ”
christie	styles	“ candle grease ? oh , no , sir . mrs. inglethorp didn ’ t have a candle , only a reading-lamp. ” “ then , if there had been a large patch of candle grease on the floor , you think you would have been sure to have seen it ? ”
christie	styles	“ yes , sir , and i would have taken it out with a piece of blotting-paper and a hot iron. ” then poirot repeated the question he had put to dorcas : “ did your mistress ever have a green dress ? ”
christie	styles	“ no , sir. ” “ nor a mantle , nor a cape , nor a—how do you call it ? —a sports coat ? ” “ not green , sir. ” “ nor anyone else in the house ? ” annie reflected . “ no , sir. ” “ you are sure of that ? ”
christie	styles	“ quite sure. ” “ _bien ! _ that is all i want to know . thank you very much. ” with a nervous giggle , annie took herself creakingly out of the room . my pent-up excitement burst forth .
christie	styles	“ poirot , ” i cried , “ i congratulate you ! this is a great discovery. ” “ what is a great discovery ? ” “ why , that it was the cocoa and not the coffee that was poisoned . that explains everything ! of course it did not take effect until the early morning , since the cocoa was only drunk in the middle of the night . ”
christie	styles	“ so you think that the cocoa—mark well what i say , hastings , the _cocoa_—contained strychnine ? ” “ of course ! that salt on the tray , what else could it have been ? ” “ it might have been salt , ” replied poirot placidly .
christie	styles	i shrugged my shoulders . if he was going to take the matter that way , it was no good arguing with him . the idea crossed my mind , not for the first time , that poor old poirot was growing old . privately i thought it lucky that he had associated with him someone of a more receptive type of mind .
christie	styles	poirot was surveying me with quietly twinkling eyes . “ you are not pleased with me , _mon ami ? _ ” “ my dear poirot , ” i said coldly , “ it is not for me to dictate to you . you have a right to your own opinion , just as i have to mine . ”
christie	styles	“ a most admirable sentiment , ” remarked poirot , rising briskly to his feet . “ now i have finished with this room . by the way , whose is the smaller desk in the corner ? ” “ mr . inglethorp ’ s . ”
christie	styles	“ ah ! ” he tried the roll top tentatively . “ locked . but perhaps one of mrs. inglethorp ’ s keys would open it. ” he tried several , twisting and turning them with a practiced hand , and finally uttering an ejaculation of satisfaction . “ _voilà ! _ it is not the key , but it will open it at a pinch. ” he slid back the roll top , and ran a rapid eye over the neatly filed papers . to my surprise , he did not examine them , merely remarking approvingly as he relocked the desk : “ decidedly , he is a man of method , this mr. inglethorp ! ”
christie	styles	a “ man of method ” was , in poirot ’ s estimation , the highest praise that could be bestowed on any individual . i felt that my friend was not what he had been as he rambled on disconnectedly :
christie	styles	“ there were no stamps in his desk , but there might have been , eh , _mon ami ? _ there might have been ? yes ” —his eyes wandered round the room— “ this boudoir has nothing more to tell us . it did not yield much . only this . ”
christie	styles	he pulled a crumpled envelope out of his pocket , and tossed it over to me . it was rather a curious document . a plain , dirty looking old envelope with a few words scrawled across it , apparently at random . the following is a facsimile of it .
christie	styles	[ illustration ] chapter v. “ it isn ’ t strychnine , is it ? ” “ where did you find this ? ” i asked poirot , in lively curiosity . “ in the waste-paper basket . you recognise the handwriting ? ” “ yes , it is mrs. inglethorp ’ s . but what does it mean ? ”
christie	styles	poirot shrugged his shoulders . “ i can not say—but it is suggestive. ” a wild idea flashed across me . was it possible that mrs. inglethorp ’ s mind was deranged ? had she some fantastic idea of demoniacal possession ? and , if that were so , was it not also possible that she might have taken her own life ?
christie	styles	i was about to expound these theories to poirot , when his own words distracted me . “ come , ” he said , “ now to examine the coffee-cups ! ” “ my dear poirot ! what on earth is the good of that , now that we know about the cocoa ? ”
christie	styles	“ oh , _là là ! _ that miserable cocoa ! ” cried poirot flippantly . he laughed with apparent enjoyment , raising his arms to heaven in mock despair , in what i could not but consider the worst possible taste .
christie	styles	“ and , anyway , ” i said , with increasing coldness , “ as mrs. inglethorp took her coffee upstairs with her , i do not see what you expect to find , unless you consider it likely that we shall discover a packet of strychnine on the coffee tray ! ”
christie	styles	poirot was sobered at once . “ come , come , my friend , ” he said , slipping his arms through mine . “ _ne vous fâchez pas ! _ allow me to interest myself in my coffee-cups , and i will respect your cocoa . there ! is it a bargain ? ”
christie	styles	he was so quaintly humorous that i was forced to laugh ; and we went together to the drawing-room , where the coffee-cups and tray remained undisturbed as we had left them .
christie	styles	poirot made me recapitulate the scene of the night before , listening very carefully , and verifying the position of the various cups . “ so mrs. cavendish stood by the tray—and poured out . yes . then she came across to the window where you sat with mademoiselle cynthia . yes . here are the three cups . and the cup on the mantelpiece , half drunk , that would be mr. lawrence cavendish ’ s . and the one on the tray ? ”
christie	styles	“ john cavendish ’ s . i saw him put it down there. ” “ good . one , two , three , four , five—but where , then , is the cup of mr. inglethorp ? ” “ he does not take coffee. ” “ then all are accounted for . one moment , my friend . ”
christie	styles	with infinite care , he took a drop or two from the grounds in each cup , sealing them up in separate test tubes , tasting each in turn as he did so . his physiognomy underwent a curious change . an expression gathered there that i can only describe as half puzzled , and half relieved .
christie	styles	“ _bien ! _ ” he said at last . “ it is evident ! i had an idea—but clearly i was mistaken . yes , altogether i was mistaken . yet it is strange . but no matter ! ” and , with a characteristic shrug , he dismissed whatever it was that was worrying him from his mind . i could have told him from the beginning that this obsession of his over the coffee was bound to end in a blind alley , but i restrained my tongue . after all , though he was old , poirot had been a great man in his day .
christie	styles	“ breakfast is ready , ” said john cavendish , coming in from the hall . “ you will breakfast with us , monsieur poirot ? ” poirot acquiesced . i observed john . already he was almost restored to his normal self . the shock of the events of the last night had upset him temporarily , but his equable poise soon swung back to the normal . he was a man of very little imagination , in sharp contrast with his brother , who had , perhaps , too much .
christie	styles	ever since the early hours of the morning , john had been hard at work , sending telegrams—one of the first had gone to evelyn howard—writing notices for the papers , and generally occupying himself with the melancholy duties that a death entails .
christie	styles	“ may i ask how things are proceeding ? ” he said . “ do your investigations point to my mother having died a natural death—or—or must we prepare ourselves for the worst ? ” “ i think , mr. cavendish , ” said poirot gravely , “ that you would do well not to buoy yourself up with any false hopes . can you tell me the views of the other members of the family ? ”
christie	styles	“ my brother lawrence is convinced that we are making a fuss over nothing . he says that everything points to its being a simple case of heart failure. ” “ he does , does he ? that is very interesting—very interesting , ” murmured poirot softly . “ and mrs. cavendish ? ”
christie	styles	a faint cloud passed over john ’ s face . “ i have not the least idea what my wife ’ s views on the subject are. ” the answer brought a momentary stiffness in its train . john broke the rather awkward silence by saying with a slight effort :
christie	styles	“ i told you , didn ’ t i , that mr. inglethorp has returned ? ” poirot bent his head . “ it ’ s an awkward position for all of us . of course one has to treat him as usual—but , hang it all , one ’ s gorge does rise at sitting down to eat with a possible murderer ! ”
christie	styles	poirot nodded sympathetically . “ i quite understand . it is a very difficult situation for you , mr. cavendish . i would like to ask you one question . mr. inglethorp ’ s reason for not returning last night was , i believe , that he had forgotten the latch-key . is not that so ? ”
christie	styles	“ yes. ” “ i suppose you are quite sure that the latch-key _was_ forgotten—that he did not take it after all ? ” “ i have no idea . i never thought of looking . we always keep it in the hall drawer . i ’ ll go and see if it ’ s there now . ”
christie	styles	poirot held up his hand with a faint smile . “ no , no , mr. cavendish , it is too late now . i am certain that you would find it . if mr. inglethorp did take it , he has had ample time to replace it by now . ”
christie	styles	“ but do you think—— ” “ i think nothing . if anyone had chanced to look this morning before his return , and seen it there , it would have been a valuable point in his favour . that is all . ”
christie	styles	john looked perplexed . “ do not worry , ” said poirot smoothly . “ i assure you that you need not let it trouble you . since you are so kind , let us go and have some breakfast . ”
christie	styles	everyone was assembled in the dining-room . under the circumstances , we were naturally not a cheerful party . the reaction after a shock is always trying , and i think we were all suffering from it . decorum and good breeding naturally enjoined that our demeanour should be much as usual , yet i could not help wondering if this self-control were really a matter of great difficulty . there were no red eyes , no signs of secretly indulged grief . i felt that i was right in my opinion that dorcas was the person most affected by the personal side of the tragedy .
christie	styles	i pass over alfred inglethorp , who acted the bereaved widower in a manner that i felt to be disgusting in its hypocrisy . did he know that we suspected him , i wondered . surely he could not be unaware of the fact , conceal it as we would . did he feel some secret stirring of fear , or was he confident that his crime would go unpunished ? surely the suspicion in the atmosphere must warn him that he was already a marked man .
christie	styles	but did everyone suspect him ? what about mrs. cavendish ? i watched her as she sat at the head of the table , graceful , composed , enigmatic . in her soft grey frock , with white ruffles at the wrists falling over her slender hands , she looked very beautiful . when she chose , however , her face could be sphinx-like in its inscrutability . she was very silent , hardly opening her lips , and yet in some queer way i felt that the great strength of her personality was dominating us all .
christie	styles	and little cynthia ? did she suspect ? she looked very tired and ill , i thought . the heaviness and languor of her manner were very marked . i asked her if she were feeling ill , and she answered frankly :
christie	styles	“ yes , i ’ ve got the most beastly headache. ” “ have another cup of coffee , mademoiselle ? ” said poirot solicitously . “ it will revive you . it is unparalleled for the _mal de tête_. ” he jumped up and took her cup .
christie	styles	“ no sugar , ” said cynthia , watching him , as he picked up the sugar-tongs . “ no sugar ? you abandon it in the war-time , eh ? ” “ no , i never take it in coffee. ” “ _sacré ! _ ” murmured poirot to himself , as he brought back the replenished cup .
christie	styles	only i heard him , and glancing up curiously at the little man i saw that his face was working with suppressed excitement , and his eyes were as green as a cat ’ s . he had heard or seen something that had affected him strongly—but what was it ? i do not usually label myself as dense , but i must confess that nothing out of the ordinary had attracted _my_ attention .
christie	styles	in another moment , the door opened and dorcas appeared . “ mr . wells to see you , sir , ” she said to john . i remembered the name as being that of the lawyer to whom mrs. inglethorp had written the night before .
christie	styles	john rose immediately . “ show him into my study. ” then he turned to us . “ my mother ’ s lawyer , ” he explained . and in a lower voice : “ he is also coroner—you understand . perhaps you would like to come with me ? ”
christie	styles	we acquiesced and followed him out of the room . john strode on ahead and i took the opportunity of whispering to poirot : “ there will be an inquest then ? ” poirot nodded absently . he seemed absorbed in thought ; so much so that my curiosity was aroused .
christie	styles	“ what is it ? you are not attending to what i say. ” “ it is true , my friend . i am much worried. ” “ why ? ” “ because mademoiselle cynthia does not take sugar in her coffee . ”
christie	styles	“ what ? you can not be serious ? ” “ but i am most serious . ah , there is something there that i do not understand . my instinct was right. ” “ what instinct ? ” “ the instinct that led me to insist on examining those coffee-cups . _chut ! _ no more now ! ”
christie	styles	we followed john into his study , and he closed the door behind us . mr. wells was a pleasant man of middle-age , with keen eyes , and the typical lawyer ’ s mouth . john introduced us both , and explained the reason of our presence .
christie	styles	“ you will understand , wells , ” he added , “ that this is all strictly private . we are still hoping that there will turn out to be no need for investigation of any kind . ”
christie	styles	“ quite so , quite so , ” said mr. wells soothingly . “ i wish we could have spared you the pain and publicity of an inquest , but of course it ’ s quite unavoidable in the absence of a doctor ’ s certificate . ”
christie	styles	“ yes , i suppose so. ” “ clever man , bauerstein . great authority on toxicology , i believe. ” “ indeed , ” said john with a certain stiffness in his manner . then he added rather hesitatingly : “ shall we have to appear as witnesses—all of us , i mean ? ”
christie	styles	“ you , of course—and ah—er—mr.—er—inglethorp. ” a slight pause ensued before the lawyer went on in his soothing manner : “ any other evidence will be simply confirmatory , a mere matter of form. ” “ i see . ”
christie	styles	a faint expression of relief swept over john ’ s face . it puzzled me , for i saw no occasion for it . “ if you know of nothing to the contrary , ” pursued mr. wells , “ i had thought of friday . that will give us plenty of time for the doctor ’ s report . the post-mortem is to take place to-night , i believe ? ”
christie	styles	“ yes. ” “ then that arrangement will suit you ? ” “ perfectly. ” “ i need not tell you , my dear cavendish , how distressed i am at this most tragic affair. ” “ can you give us no help in solving it , monsieur ? ” interposed poirot , speaking for the first time since we had entered the room .
christie	styles	“ i ? ” “ yes , we heard that mrs. inglethorp wrote to you last night . you should have received the letter this morning. ” “ i did , but it contains no information . it is merely a note asking me to call upon her this morning , as she wanted my advice on a matter of great importance . ”
christie	styles	“ she gave you no hint as to what that matter might be ? ” “ unfortunately , no. ” “ that is a pity , ” said john . “ a great pity , ” agreed poirot gravely . there was silence . poirot remained lost in thought for a few minutes . finally he turned to the lawyer again .
christie	styles	“ mr . wells , there is one thing i should like to ask you—that is , if it is not against professional etiquette . in the event of mrs. inglethorp ’ s death , who would inherit her money ? ”
christie	styles	the lawyer hesitated a moment , and then replied : “ the knowledge will be public property very soon , so if mr. cavendish does not object—— ” “ not at all , ” interpolated john . “ i do not see any reason why i should not answer your question . by her last will , dated august of last year , after various unimportant legacies to servants , etc. , she gave her entire fortune to her stepson , mr. john cavendish . ”
christie	styles	“ was not that—pardon the question , mr. cavendish—rather unfair to her other stepson , mr. lawrence cavendish ? ” “ no , i do not think so . you see , under the terms of their father ’ s will , while john inherited the property , lawrence , at his stepmother ’ s death , would come into a considerable sum of money . mrs. inglethorp left her money to her elder stepson , knowing that he would have to keep up styles . it was , to my mind , a very fair and equitable distribution . ”
christie	styles	poirot nodded thoughtfully . “ i see . but i am right in saying , am i not , that by your english law that will was automatically revoked when mrs. inglethorp remarried ? ” mr. wells bowed his head .
christie	styles	“ as i was about to proceed , monsieur poirot , that document is now null and void. ” “ _hein ! _ ” said poirot . he reflected for a moment , and then asked : “ was mrs. inglethorp herself aware of that fact ? ”
christie	styles	“ i do not know . she may have been. ” “ she was , ” said john unexpectedly . “ we were discussing the matter of wills being revoked by marriage only yesterday. ” “ ah ! one more question , mr. wells . you say ‘ her last will. ’ had mrs. inglethorp , then , made several former wills ? ”
christie	styles	“ on an average , she made a new will at least once a year , ” said mr. wells imperturbably . “ she was given to changing her mind as to her testamentary dispositions , now benefiting one , now another member of her family . ”
christie	styles	“ suppose , ” suggested poirot , “ that , unknown to you , she had made a new will in favour of someone who was not , in any sense of the word , a member of the family—we will say miss howard , for instance—would you be surprised ? ”
christie	styles	“ not in the least. ” “ ah ! ” poirot seemed to have exhausted his questions . i drew close to him , while john and the lawyer were debating the question of going through mrs. inglethorp ’ s papers .
christie	styles	“ do you think mrs. inglethorp made a will leaving all her money to miss howard ? ” i asked in a low voice , with some curiosity . poirot smiled . “ no. ” “ then why did you ask ? ”
christie	styles	“ hush ! ” john cavendish had turned to poirot . “ will you come with us , monsieur poirot ? we are going through my mother ’ s papers . mr. inglethorp is quite willing to leave it entirely to mr. wells and myself . ”
christie	styles	“ which simplifies matters very much , ” murmured the lawyer . “ as technically , of course , he was entitled—— ” he did not finish the sentence . “ we will look through the desk in the boudoir first , ” explained john , “ and go up to her bedroom afterwards . she kept her most important papers in a purple despatch-case , which we must look through carefully . ”
christie	styles	“ yes , ” said the lawyer , “ it is quite possible that there may be a later will than the one in my possession. ” “ there _is_ a later will. ” it was poirot who spoke .
christie	styles	“ what ? ” john and the lawyer looked at him startled . “ or , rather , ” pursued my friend imperturbably , “ there _was_ one. ” “ what do you mean—there was one ? where is it now ? ” “ burnt ! ” “ burnt ? ”
christie	styles	“ yes . see here. ” he took out the charred fragment we had found in the grate in mrs. inglethorp ’ s room , and handed it to the lawyer with a brief explanation of when and where he had found it .
christie	styles	“ but possibly this is an old will ? ” “ i do not think so . in fact i am almost certain that it was made no earlier than yesterday afternoon. ” “ what ? ” “ impossible ! ” broke simultaneously from both men .
christie	styles	poirot turned to john . “ if you will allow me to send for your gardener , i will prove it to you. ” “ oh , of course—but i don ’ t see—— ” poirot raised his hand .
christie	styles	“ do as i ask you . afterwards you shall question as much as you please. ” “ very well. ” he rang the bell . dorcas answered it in due course . “ dorcas , will you tell manning to come round and speak to me here . ”
christie	styles	“ yes , sir. ” dorcas withdrew . we waited in a tense silence . poirot alone seemed perfectly at his ease , and dusted a forgotten corner of the bookcase . the clumping of hobnailed boots on the gravel outside proclaimed the approach of manning . john looked questioningly at poirot . the latter nodded .
christie	styles	“ come inside , manning , ” said john , “ i want to speak to you. ” manning came slowly and hesitatingly through the french window , and stood as near it as he could . he held his cap in his hands , twisting it very carefully round and round . his back was much bent , though he was probably not as old as he looked , but his eyes were sharp and intelligent , and belied his slow and rather cautious speech .
christie	styles	“ manning , ” said john , “ this gentleman will put some questions to you which i want you to answer. ” “ yessir , ” mumbled manning . poirot stepped forward briskly . manning ’ s eye swept over him with a faint contempt .
christie	styles	“ you were planting a bed of begonias round by the south side of the house yesterday afternoon , were you not , manning ? ” “ yes , sir , me and willum. ” “ and mrs. inglethorp came to the window and called you , did she not ? ”
christie	styles	“ yes , sir , she did. ” “ tell me in your own words exactly what happened after that. ” “ well , sir , nothing much . she just told willum to go on his bicycle down to the village , and bring back a form of will , or such-like—i don ’ t know what exactly—she wrote it down for him . ”
christie	styles	“ well ? ” “ well , he did , sir. ” “ and what happened next ? ” “ we went on with the begonias , sir. ” “ did not mrs. inglethorp call you again ? ” “ yes , sir , both me and willum , she called . ”
christie	styles	“ and then ? ” “ she made us come right in , and sign our names at the bottom of a long paper—under where she ’ d signed. ” “ did you see anything of what was written above her signature ? ” asked poirot sharply .
christie	styles	“ no , sir , there was a bit of blotting paper over that part. ” “ and you signed where she told you ? ” “ yes , sir , first me and then willum. ” “ what did she do with it afterwards ? ”
christie	styles	“ well , sir , she slipped it into a long envelope , and put it inside a sort of purple box that was standing on the desk. ” “ what time was it when she first called you ? ”
christie	styles	“ about four , i should say , sir. ” “ not earlier ? couldn ’ t it have been about half-past three ? ” “ no , i shouldn ’ t say so , sir . it would be more likely to be a bit after four—not before it . ”
christie	styles	“ thank you , manning , that will do , ” said poirot pleasantly . the gardener glanced at his master , who nodded , whereupon manning lifted a finger to his forehead with a low mumble , and backed cautiously out of the window .
christie	styles	we all looked at each other . “ good heavens ! ” murmured john . “ what an extraordinary coincidence. ” “ how—a coincidence ? ” “ that my mother should have made a will on the very day of her death ! ”
christie	styles	mr. wells cleared his throat and remarked drily : “ are you so sure it is a coincidence , cavendish ? ” “ what do you mean ? ” “ your mother , you tell me , had a violent quarrel with—someone yesterday afternoon—— ”
christie	styles	“ what do you mean ? ” cried john again . there was a tremor in his voice , and he had gone very pale . “ in consequence of that quarrel , your mother very suddenly and hurriedly makes a new will . the contents of that will we shall never know . she told no one of its provisions . this morning , no doubt , she would have consulted me on the subject—but she had no chance . the will disappears , and she takes its secret with her to her grave . cavendish , i much fear there is no coincidence there . monsieur poirot , i am sure you agree with me that the facts are very suggestive . ”
christie	styles	“ suggestive , or not , ” interrupted john , “ we are most grateful to monsieur poirot for elucidating the matter . but for him , we should never have known of this will . i suppose , i may not ask you , monsieur , what first led you to suspect the fact ? ”
christie	styles	poirot smiled and answered : “ a scribbled over old envelope , and a freshly planted bed of begonias. ” john , i think , would have pressed his questions further , but at that moment the loud purr of a motor was audible , and we all turned to the window as it swept past .
christie	styles	“ evie ! ” cried john . “ excuse me , wells. ” he went hurriedly out into the hall . poirot looked inquiringly at me . “ miss howard , ” i explained . “ ah , i am glad she has come . there is a woman with a head and a heart too , hastings . though the good god gave her no beauty ! ”
christie	styles	i followed john ’ s example , and went out into the hall , where miss howard was endeavouring to extricate herself from the voluminous mass of veils that enveloped her head . as her eyes fell on me , a sudden pang of guilt shot through me . this was the woman who had warned me so earnestly , and to whose warning i had , alas , paid no heed ! how soon , and how contemptuously , i had dismissed it from my mind . now that she had been proved justified in so tragic a manner , i felt ashamed . she had known alfred inglethorp only too well . i wondered whether , if she had remained at styles , the tragedy would have taken place , or would the man have feared her watchful eyes ?
christie	styles	i was relieved when she shook me by the hand , with her well remembered painful grip . the eyes that met mine were sad , but not reproachful ; that she had been crying bitterly , i could tell by the redness of her eyelids , but her manner was unchanged from its old gruffness .
christie	styles	“ started the moment i got the wire . just come off night duty . hired car . quickest way to get here. ” “ have you had anything to eat this morning , evie ? ” asked john .
christie	styles	“ no. ” “ i thought not . come along , breakfast ’ s not cleared away yet , and they ’ ll make you some fresh tea. ” he turned to me . “ look after her , hastings , will you ? wells is waiting for me . oh , here ’ s monsieur poirot . he ’ s helping us , you know , evie . ”
christie	styles	miss howard shook hands with poirot , but glanced suspiciously over her shoulder at john . “ what do you mean—helping us ? ” “ helping us to investigate. ” “ nothing to investigate . have they taken him to prison yet ? ”
christie	styles	“ taken who to prison ? ” “ who ? alfred inglethorp , of course ! ” “ my dear evie , do be careful . lawrence is of the opinion that my mother died from heart seizure. ” “ more fool , lawrence ! ” retorted miss howard . “ of course alfred inglethorp murdered poor emily—as i always told you he would . ”
christie	styles	“ my dear evie , don ’ t shout so . whatever we may think or suspect , it is better to say as little as possible for the present . the inquest isn ’ t until friday. ” “ not until fiddlesticks ! ” the snort miss howard gave was truly magnificent . “ you ’ re all off your heads . the man will be out of the country by then . if he ’ s any sense , he won ’ t stay here tamely and wait to be hanged . ”
christie	styles	john cavendish looked at her helplessly . “ i know what it is , ” she accused him , “ you ’ ve been listening to the doctors . never should . what do they know ? nothing at all—or just enough to make them dangerous . i ought to know—my own father was a doctor . that little wilkins is about the greatest fool that even i have ever seen . heart seizure ! sort of thing he would say . anyone with any sense could see at once that her husband had poisoned her . i always said he ’ d murder her in her bed , poor soul . now he ’ s done it . and all you can do is to murmur silly things about ‘ heart seizure ’ and ‘ inquest on friday. ’ you ought to be ashamed of yourself , john cavendish . ”
christie	styles	“ what do you want me to do ? ” asked john , unable to help a faint smile . “ dash it all , evie , i can ’ t haul him down to the local police station by the scruff of his neck . ”
christie	styles	“ well , you might do something . find out how he did it . he ’ s a crafty beggar . dare say he soaked fly papers . ask cook if she ’ s missed any. ” it occurred to me very forcibly at that moment that to harbour miss howard and alfred inglethorp under the same roof , and keep the peace between them , was likely to prove a herculean task , and i did not envy john . i could see by the expression of his face that he fully appreciated the difficulty of the position . for the moment , he sought refuge in retreat , and left the room precipitately .
christie	styles	dorcas brought in fresh tea . as she left the room , poirot came over from the window where he had been standing , and sat down facing miss howard . “ mademoiselle , ” he said gravely , “ i want to ask you something . ”
christie	styles	“ ask away , ” said the lady , eyeing him with some disfavour . “ i want to be able to count upon your help. ” “ i ’ ll help you to hang alfred with pleasure , ” she replied gruffly . “ hanging ’ s too good for him . ought to be drawn and quartered , like in good old times . ”
christie	styles	“ we are at one then , ” said poirot , “ for i , too , want to hang the criminal. ” “ alfred inglethorp ? ” “ him , or another. ” “ no question of another . poor emily was never murdered until _he_ came along . i don ’ t say she wasn ’ t surrounded by sharks—she was . but it was only her purse they were after . her life was safe enough . but along comes mr. alfred inglethorp—and within two months—hey presto ! ”
christie	styles	“ believe me , miss howard , ” said poirot very earnestly , “ if mr. inglethorp is the man , he shall not escape me . on my honour , i will hang him as high as haman ! ”
christie	styles	“ that ’ s better , ” said miss howard more enthusiastically . “ but i must ask you to trust me . now your help may be very valuable to me . i will tell you why . because , in all this house of mourning , yours are the only eyes that have wept . ”
christie	styles	miss howard blinked , and a new note crept into the gruffness of her voice . “ if you mean that i was fond of her—yes , i was . you know , emily was a selfish old woman in her way . she was very generous , but she always wanted a return . she never let people forget what she had done for them—and , that way she missed love . don ’ t think she ever realized it , though , or felt the lack of it . hope not , anyway . i was on a different footing . i took my stand from the first . ‘ so many pounds a year i ’ m worth to you . well and good . but not a penny piece besides—not a pair of gloves , nor a theatre ticket. ’ she didn ’ t understand—was very offended sometimes . said i was foolishly proud . it wasn ’ t that—but i couldn ’ t explain . anyway , i kept my self-respect . and so , out of the whole bunch , i was the only one who could allow myself to be fond of her . i watched over her . i guarded her from the lot of them , and then a glib-tongued scoundrel comes along , and pooh ! all my years of devotion go for nothing . ”
christie	styles	poirot nodded sympathetically . “ i understand , mademoiselle , i understand all you feel . it is most natural . you think that we are lukewarm—that we lack fire and energy—but trust me , it is not so . ”
christie	styles	john stuck his head in at this juncture , and invited us both to come up to mrs. inglethorp ’ s room , as he and mr. wells had finished looking through the desk in the boudoir .
christie	styles	as we went up the stairs , john looked back to the dining-room door , and lowered his voice confidentially : “ look here , what ’ s going to happen when these two meet ? ” i shook my head helplessly .
christie	styles	“ i ’ ve told mary to keep them apart if she can. ” “ will she be able to do so ? ” “ the lord only knows . there ’ s one thing , inglethorp himself won ’ t be too keen on meeting her . ”
christie	styles	“ you ’ ve got the keys still , haven ’ t you , poirot ? ” i asked , as we reached the door of the locked room . taking the keys from poirot , john unlocked it , and we all passed in . the lawyer went straight to the desk , and john followed him .
christie	styles	“ my mother kept most of her important papers in this despatch-case , i believe , ” he said . poirot drew out the small bunch of keys . “ permit me . i locked it , out of precaution , this morning . ”
christie	styles	“ but it ’ s not locked now. ” “ impossible ! ” “ see. ” and john lifted the lid as he spoke . “ _milles tonnerres ! _ ” cried poirot , dumbfounded . “ and i—who have both the keys in my pocket ! ” he flung himself upon the case . suddenly he stiffened . “ _eh voilà une affaire ! _ this lock has been forced . ”
christie	styles	“ what ? ” poirot laid down the case again . “ but who forced it ? why should they ? when ? but the door was locked ? ” these exclamations burst from us disjointedly . poirot answered them categorically—almost mechanically .
christie	styles	“ who ? that is the question . why ? ah , if i only knew . when ? since i was here an hour ago . as to the door being locked , it is a very ordinary lock . probably any other of the doorkeys in this passage would fit it . ”
christie	styles	we stared at one another blankly . poirot had walked over to the mantelpiece . he was outwardly calm , but i noticed his hands , which from long force of habit were mechanically straightening the spill vases on the mantelpiece , were shaking violently .
christie	styles	“ see here , it was like this , ” he said at last . “ there was something in that case—some piece of evidence , slight in itself perhaps , but still enough of a clue to connect the murderer with the crime . it was vital to him that it should be destroyed before it was discovered and its significance appreciated . therefore , he took the risk , the great risk , of coming in here . finding the case locked , he was obliged to force it , thus betraying his presence . for him to take that risk , it must have been something of great importance . ”
christie	styles	“ but what was it ? ” “ ah ! ” cried poirot , with a gesture of anger . “ that , i do not know ! a document of some kind , without doubt , possibly the scrap of paper dorcas saw in her hand yesterday afternoon . and i— ” his anger burst forth freely— “ miserable animal that i am ! i guessed nothing ! i have behaved like an imbecile ! i should never have left that case here . i should have carried it away with me . ah , triple pig ! and now it is gone . it is destroyed—but is it destroyed ? is there not yet a chance—we must leave no stone unturned— ”
christie	styles	he rushed like a madman from the room , and i followed him as soon as i had sufficiently recovered my wits . but , by the time i had reached the top of the stairs , he was out of sight .
christie	styles	mary cavendish was standing where the staircase branched , staring down into the hall in the direction in which he had disappeared . “ what has happened to your extraordinary little friend , mr. hastings ? he has just rushed past me like a mad bull . ”
christie	styles	“ he ’ s rather upset about something , ” i remarked feebly . i really did not know how much poirot would wish me to disclose . as i saw a faint smile gather on mrs. cavendish ’ s expressive mouth , i endeavoured to try and turn the conversation by saying : “ they haven ’ t met yet , have they ? ”
christie	styles	“ who ? ” “ mr . inglethorp and miss howard. ” she looked at me in rather a disconcerting manner . “ do you think it would be such a disaster if they did meet ? ” “ well , don ’ t you ? ” i said , rather taken aback .
christie	styles	“ no. ” she was smiling in her quiet way . “ i should like to see a good flare up . it would clear the air . at present we are all thinking so much , and saying so little . ”
christie	styles	“ john doesn ’ t think so , ” i remarked . “ he ’ s anxious to keep them apart. ” “ oh , john ! ” something in her tone fired me , and i blurted out : “ old john ’ s an awfully good sort . ”
christie	styles	she studied me curiously for a minute or two , and then said , to my great surprise : “ you are loyal to your friend . i like you for that. ” “ aren ’ t you my friend too ? ”
christie	styles	“ i am a very bad friend. ” “ why do you say that ? ” “ because it is true . i am charming to my friends one day , and forget all about them the next . ”
christie	styles	i don ’ t know what impelled me , but i was nettled , and i said foolishly and not in the best of taste : “ yet you seem to be invariably charming to dr. bauerstein ! ”
christie	styles	instantly i regretted my words . her face stiffened . i had the impression of a steel curtain coming down and blotting out the real woman . without a word , she turned and went swiftly up the stairs , whilst i stood like an idiot gaping after her .
christie	styles	i was recalled to other matters by a frightful row going on below . i could hear poirot shouting and expounding . i was vexed to think that my diplomacy had been in vain . the little man appeared to be taking the whole house into his confidence , a proceeding of which i , for one , doubted the wisdom . once again i could not help regretting that my friend was so prone to lose his head in moments of excitement . i stepped briskly down the stairs . the sight of me calmed poirot almost immediately . i drew him aside .
christie	styles	“ my dear fellow , ” i said , “ is this wise ? surely you don ’ t want the whole house to know of this occurrence ? you are actually playing into the criminal ’ s hands. ” “ you think so , hastings ? ”
christie	styles	“ i am sure of it. ” “ well , well , my friend , i will be guided by you. ” “ good . although , unfortunately , it is a little too late now. ” “ sure. ” he looked so crestfallen and abashed that i felt quite sorry , though i still thought my rebuke a just and wise one .
christie	styles	“ well , ” he said at last , “ let us go , _mon ami_. ” “ you have finished here ? ” “ for the moment , yes . you will walk back with me to the village ? ” “ willingly. ” he picked up his little suit-case , and we went out through the open window in the drawing-room . cynthia murdoch was just coming in , and poirot stood aside to let her pass .
christie	styles	“ excuse me , mademoiselle , one minute. ” “ yes ? ” she turned inquiringly . “ did you ever make up mrs. inglethorp ’ s medicines ? ” a slight flush rose in her face , as she answered rather constrainedly : “ no . ”
christie	styles	“ only her powders ? ” the flush deepened as cynthia replied : “ oh , yes , i did make up some sleeping powders for her once. ” “ these ? ” poirot produced the empty box which had contained powders .
christie	styles	she nodded . “ can you tell me what they were ? sulphonal ? veronal ? ” “ no , they were bromide powders. ” “ ah ! thank you , mademoiselle ; good morning. ” as we walked briskly away from the house , i glanced at him more than once . i had often before noticed that , if anything excited him , his eyes turned green like a cat ’ s . they were shining like emeralds now .
christie	styles	“ my friend , ” he broke out at last , “ i have a little idea , a very strange , and probably utterly impossible idea . and yet—it fits in. ” i shrugged my shoulders . i privately thought that poirot was rather too much given to these fantastic ideas . in this case , surely , the truth was only too plain and apparent .
christie	styles	“ so that is the explanation of the blank label on the box , ” i remarked . “ very simple , as you said . i really wonder that i did not think of it myself . ”
christie	styles	poirot did not appear to be listening to me . “ they have made one more discovery , _là-bas_ , ” he observed , jerking his thumb over his shoulder in the direction of styles . “ mr . wells told me as we were going upstairs . ”
christie	styles	“ what was it ? ” “ locked up in the desk in the boudoir , they found a will of mrs. inglethorp ’ s , dated before her marriage , leaving her fortune to alfred inglethorp . it must have been made just at the time they were engaged . it came quite as a surprise to wells—and to john cavendish also . it was written on one of those printed will forms , and witnessed by two of the servants—not dorcas . ”
christie	styles	“ did mr. inglethorp know of it ? ” “ he says not. ” “ one might take that with a grain of salt , ” i remarked sceptically . “ all these wills are very confusing . tell me , how did those scribbled words on the envelope help you to discover that a will was made yesterday afternoon ? ”
christie	styles	poirot smiled . “ _mon ami_ , have you ever , when writing a letter , been arrested by the fact that you did not know how to spell a certain word ? ” “ yes , often . i suppose everyone has . ”
christie	styles	“ exactly . and have you not , in such a case , tried the word once or twice on the edge of the blotting-paper , or a spare scrap of paper , to see if it looked right ? well , that is what mrs. inglethorp did . you will notice that the word ‘ possessed ’ is spelt first with one ‘ s ’ and subsequently with two—correctly . to make sure , she had further tried it in a sentence , thus : ‘ i am possessed. ’ now , what did that tell me ? it told me that mrs. inglethorp had been writing the word ‘ possessed ’ that afternoon , and , having the fragment of paper found in the grate fresh in my mind , the possibility of a will— ( a document almost certain to contain that word ) —occurred to me at once . this possibility was confirmed by a further circumstance . in the general confusion , the boudoir had not been swept that morning , and near the desk were several traces of brown mould and earth . the weather had been perfectly fine for some days , and no ordinary boots would have left such a heavy deposit .
christie	styles	“ i strolled to the window , and saw at once that the begonia beds had been newly planted . the mould in the beds was exactly similar to that on the floor of the boudoir , and also i learnt from you that they _had_ been planted yesterday afternoon . i was now sure that one , or possibly both of the gardeners—for there were two sets of footprints in the bed—had entered the boudoir , for if mrs. inglethorp had merely wished to speak to them she would in all probability have stood at the window , and they would not have come into the room at all . i was now quite convinced that she had made a fresh will , and had called the two gardeners in to witness her signature . events proved that i was right in my supposition . ”
christie	styles	“ that was very ingenious , ” i could not help admitting . “ i must confess that the conclusions i drew from those few scribbled words were quite erroneous. ” he smiled . “ you gave too much rein to your imagination . imagination is a good servant , and a bad master . the simplest explanation is always the most likely . ”
christie	styles	“ another point—how did you know that the key of the despatch-case had been lost ? ” “ i did not know it . it was a guess that turned out to be correct . you observed that it had a piece of twisted wire through the handle . that suggested to me at once that it had possibly been wrenched off a flimsy key-ring . now , if it had been lost and recovered , mrs. inglethorp would at once have replaced it on her bunch ; but on her bunch i found what was obviously the duplicate key , very new and bright , which led me to the hypothesis that somebody else had inserted the original key in the lock of the despatch-case . ”
christie	styles	“ yes , ” i said , “ alfred inglethorp , without doubt. ” poirot looked at me curiously . “ you are very sure of his guilt ? ” “ well , naturally . every fresh circumstance seems to establish it more clearly . ”
christie	styles	“ on the contrary , ” said poirot quietly , “ there are several points in his favour. ” “ oh , come now ! ” “ yes. ” “ i see only one. ” “ and that ? ” “ that he was not in the house last night . ”
christie	styles	“ ‘ bad shot ! ’ as you english say ! you have chosen the one point that to my mind tells against him. ” “ how is that ? ” “ because if mr. inglethorp knew that his wife would be poisoned last night , he would certainly have arranged to be away from the house . his excuse was an obviously trumped up one . that leaves us two possibilities : either he knew what was going to happen or he had a reason of his own for his absence . ”
christie	styles	“ and that reason ? ” i asked sceptically . poirot shrugged his shoulders . “ how should i know ? discreditable , without doubt . this mr. inglethorp , i should say , is somewhat of a scoundrel—but that does not of necessity make him a murderer . ”
christie	styles	i shook my head , unconvinced . “ we do not agree , eh ? ” said poirot . “ well , let us leave it . time will show which of us is right . now let us turn to other aspects of the case . what do you make of the fact that all the doors of the bedroom were bolted on the inside ? ”
christie	styles	“ well—— ” i considered . “ one must look at it logically. ” “ true. ” “ i should put it this way . the doors _were_ bolted—our own eyes have told us that—yet the presence of the candle grease on the floor , and the destruction of the will , prove that during the night someone entered the room . you agree so far ? ”
christie	styles	“ perfectly . put with admirable clearness . proceed. ” “ well , ” i said , encouraged , “ as the person who entered did not do so by the window , nor by miraculous means , it follows that the door must have been opened from inside by mrs. inglethorp herself . that strengthens the conviction that the person in question was her husband . she would naturally open the door to her own husband . ”
christie	styles	poirot shook his head . “ why should she ? she had bolted the door leading into his room—a most unusual proceeding on her part—she had had a most violent quarrel with him that very afternoon . no , he was the last person she would admit . ”
christie	styles	“ but you agree with me that the door must have been opened by mrs. inglethorp herself ? ” “ there is another possibility . she may have forgotten to bolt the door into the passage when she went to bed , and have got up later , towards morning , and bolted it then . ”
christie	styles	“ poirot , is that seriously your opinion ? ” “ no , i do not say it is so , but it might be . now , to turn to another feature , what do you make of the scrap of conversation you overheard between mrs. cavendish and her mother-in-law ? ”
christie	styles	“ i had forgotten that , ” i said thoughtfully . “ that is as enigmatical as ever . it seems incredible that a woman like mrs. cavendish , proud and reticent to the last degree , should interfere so violently in what was certainly not her affair . ”
christie	styles	“ precisely . it was an astonishing thing for a woman of her breeding to do. ” “ it is certainly curious , ” i agreed . “ still , it is unimportant , and need not be taken into account . ”
christie	styles	a groan burst from poirot . “ what have i always told you ? everything must be taken into account . if the fact will not fit the theory—let the theory go. ” “ well , we shall see , ” i said , nettled .
christie	styles	“ yes , we shall see. ” we had reached leastways cottage , and poirot ushered me upstairs to his own room . he offered me one of the tiny russian cigarettes he himself occasionally smoked . i was amused to notice that he stowed away the used matches most carefully in a little china pot . my momentary annoyance vanished .
christie	styles	poirot had placed our two chairs in front of the open window which commanded a view of the village street . the fresh air blew in warm and pleasant . it was going to be a hot day .
christie	styles	suddenly my attention was arrested by a weedy looking young man rushing down the street at a great pace . it was the expression on his face that was extraordinary—a curious mingling of terror and agitation .
christie	styles	“ look , poirot ! ” i said . he leant forward . “ _tiens ! _ ” he said . “ it is mr. mace , from the chemist ’ s shop . he is coming here. ” the young man came to a halt before leastways cottage , and , after hesitating a moment , pounded vigorously at the door .
christie	styles	“ a little minute , ” cried poirot from the window . “ i come. ” motioning to me to follow him , he ran swiftly down the stairs and opened the door . mr. mace began at once .
christie	styles	“ oh , mr. poirot , i ’ m sorry for the inconvenience , but i heard that you ’ d just come back from the hall ? ” “ yes , we have. ” the young man moistened his dry lips . his face was working curiously .
christie	styles	“ it ’ s all over the village about old mrs. inglethorp dying so suddenly . they do say— ” he lowered his voice cautiously— “ that it ’ s poison ? ” poirot ’ s face remained quite impassive . “ only the doctors can tell us that , mr. mace . ”
christie	styles	“ yes , exactly—of course—— ” the young man hesitated , and then his agitation was too much for him . he clutched poirot by the arm , and sank his voice to a whisper : “ just tell me this , mr. poirot , it isn ’ t—it isn ’ t strychnine , is it ? ”
christie	styles	i hardly heard what poirot replied . something evidently of a non-committal nature . the young man departed , and as he closed the door poirot ’ s eyes met mine . “ yes , ” he said , nodding gravely . “ he will have evidence to give at the inquest . ”
christie	styles	we went slowly upstairs again . i was opening my lips , when poirot stopped me with a gesture of his hand . “ not now , not now , _mon ami_ . i have need of reflection . my mind is in some disorder—which is not well . ”
christie	styles	for about ten minutes he sat in dead silence , perfectly still , except for several expressive motions of his eyebrows , and all the time his eyes grew steadily greener . at last he heaved a deep sigh .
christie	styles	“ it is well . the bad moment has passed . now all is arranged and classified . one must never permit confusion . the case is not clear yet—no . for it is of the most complicated ! it puzzles _me_ . _me_ , hercule poirot ! there are two facts of significance . ”
christie	styles	“ and what are they ? ” “ the first is the state of the weather yesterday . that is very important. ” “ but it was a glorious day ! ” i interrupted . “ poirot , you ’ re pulling my leg ! ”
christie	styles	“ not at all . the thermometer registered 80 degrees in the shade . do not forget that , my friend . it is the key to the whole riddle ! ” “ and the second point ? ” i asked .
christie	styles	“ the important fact that monsieur inglethorp wears very peculiar clothes , has a black beard , and uses glasses. ” “ poirot , i can not believe you are serious. ” “ i am absolutely serious , my friend . ”
christie	styles	“ but this is childish ! ” “ no , it is very momentous. ” “ and supposing the coroner ’ s jury returns a verdict of wilful murder against alfred inglethorp . what becomes of your theories , then ? ” “ they would not be shaken because twelve stupid men had happened to make a mistake ! but that will not occur . for one thing , a country jury is not anxious to take responsibility upon itself , and mr. inglethorp stands practically in the position of local squire . also , ” he added placidly , “ _i_ should not allow it ! ”
christie	styles	“ _you_ would not allow it ? ” “ no. ” i looked at the extraordinary little man , divided between annoyance and amusement . he was so tremendously sure of himself . as though he read my thoughts , he nodded gently .
christie	styles	“ oh , yes , _mon ami_ , i would do what i say. ” he got up and laid his hand on my shoulder . his physiognomy underwent a complete change . tears came into his eyes . “ in all this , you see , i think of that poor mrs. inglethorp who is dead . she was not extravagantly loved—no . but she was very good to us belgians—i owe her a debt . ”
christie	styles	i endeavoured to interrupt , but poirot swept on . “ let me tell you this , hastings . she would never forgive me if i let alfred inglethorp , her husband , be arrested _now_—when a word from me could save him ! ”
christie	styles	chapter vi . the inquest in the interval before the inquest , poirot was unfailing in his activity . twice he was closeted with mr. wells . he also took long walks into the country . i rather resented his not taking me into his confidence , the more so as i could not in the least guess what he was driving at .
christie	styles	it occurred to me that he might have been making inquiries at raikes ’ s farm ; so , finding him out when i called at leastways cottage on wednesday evening , i walked over there by the fields , hoping to meet him . but there was no sign of him , and i hesitated to go right up to the farm itself . as i walked away , i met an aged rustic , who leered at me cunningly .
christie	styles	“ you ’ m from the hall , bain ’ t you ? ” he asked . “ yes . i ’ m looking for a friend of mine whom i thought might have walked this way. ” “ a little chap ? as waves his hands when he talks ? one of them belgies from the village ? ”
christie	styles	“ yes , ” i said eagerly . “ he has been here , then ? ” “ oh , ay , he ’ s been here , right enough . more ’ n once too . friend of yours , is he ? ah , you gentlemen from the hall—you ’ m a pretty lot ! ” and he leered more jocosely than ever .
christie	styles	“ why , do the gentlemen from the hall come here often ? ” i asked , as carelessly as i could . he winked at me knowingly . “ _one_ does , mister . naming no names , mind . and a very liberal gentleman too ! oh , thank you , sir , i ’ m sure . ”
christie	styles	i walked on sharply . evelyn howard had been right then , and i experienced a sharp twinge of disgust , as i thought of alfred inglethorp ’ s liberality with another woman ’ s money . had that piquant gipsy face been at the bottom of the crime , or was it the baser mainspring of money ? probably a judicious mixture of both .
christie	styles	on one point , poirot seemed to have a curious obsession . he once or twice observed to me that he thought dorcas must have made an error in fixing the time of the quarrel . he suggested to her repeatedly that it was four-thirty , and not four o ’ clock when she had heard the voices .
christie	styles	but dorcas was unshaken . quite an hour , or even more , had elapsed between the time when she had heard the voices and five o ’ clock , when she had taken tea to her mistress .
christie	styles	the inquest was held on friday at the stylites arms in the village . poirot and i sat together , not being required to give evidence . the preliminaries were gone through . the jury viewed the body , and john cavendish gave evidence of identification .
christie	styles	further questioned , he described his awakening in the early hours of the morning , and the circumstances of his mother ’ s death . the medical evidence was next taken . there was a breathless hush , and every eye was fixed on the famous london specialist , who was known to be one of the greatest authorities of the day on the subject of toxicology .
christie	styles	in a few brief words , he summed up the result of the post-mortem . shorn of its medical phraseology and technicalities , it amounted to the fact that mrs. inglethorp had met her death as the result of strychnine poisoning . judging from the quantity recovered , she must have taken not less than three-quarters of a grain of strychnine , but probably one grain or slightly over .
christie	styles	“ is it possible that she could have swallowed the poison by accident ? ” asked the coroner . “ i should consider it very unlikely . strychnine is not used for domestic purposes , as some poisons are , and there are restrictions placed on its sale . ”
christie	styles	“ does anything in your examination lead you to determine how the poison was administered ? ” “ no. ” “ you arrived at styles before dr. wilkins , i believe ? ” “ that is so . the motor met me just outside the lodge gates , and i hurried there as fast as i could . ”
christie	styles	“ will you relate to us exactly what happened next ? ” “ i entered mrs. inglethorp ’ s room . she was at that moment in a typical tetanic convulsion . she turned towards me , and gasped out : ‘ alfred—alfred—— ’ ”
christie	styles	“ could the strychnine have been administered in mrs. inglethorp ’ s after-dinner coffee which was taken to her by her husband ? ” “ possibly , but strychnine is a fairly rapid drug in its action . the symptoms appear from one to two hours after it has been swallowed . it is retarded under certain conditions , none of which , however , appear to have been present in this case . i presume mrs. inglethorp took the coffee after dinner about eight o ’ clock , whereas the symptoms did not manifest themselves until the early hours of the morning , which , on the face of it , points to the drug having been taken much later in the evening . ”
christie	styles	“ mrs . inglethorp was in the habit of drinking a cup of cocoa in the middle of the night . could the strychnine have been administered in that ? ” “ no , i myself took a sample of the cocoa remaining in the saucepan and had it analysed . there was no strychnine present . ”
christie	styles	i heard poirot chuckle softly beside me . “ how did you know ? ” i whispered . “ listen. ” “ i should say ” —the doctor was continuing— “ that i would have been considerably surprised at any other result . ”
christie	styles	“ why ? ” “ simply because strychnine has an unusually bitter taste . it can be detected in a solution of one in seventy thousand , and can only be disguised by some strongly flavoured substance . cocoa would be quite powerless to mask it . ”
christie	styles	one of the jury wanted to know if the same objection applied to coffee . “ no . coffee has a bitter taste of its own which would probably cover the taste of strychnine . ”
christie	styles	“ then you consider it more likely that the drug was administered in the coffee , but that for some unknown reason its action was delayed. ” “ yes , but , the cup being completely smashed , there is no possibility of analyzing its contents . ”
christie	styles	this concluded dr. bauerstein ’ s evidence . dr. wilkins corroborated it on all points . sounded as to the possibility of suicide , he repudiated it utterly . the deceased , he said , suffered from a weak heart , but otherwise enjoyed perfect health , and was of a cheerful and well-balanced disposition . she would be one of the last people to take her own life .
christie	styles	lawrence cavendish was next called . his evidence was quite unimportant , being a mere repetition of that of his brother . just as he was about to step down , he paused , and said rather hesitatingly :
christie	styles	“ i should like to make a suggestion if i may ? ” he glanced deprecatingly at the coroner , who replied briskly : “ certainly , mr. cavendish , we are here to arrive at the truth of this matter , and welcome anything that may lead to further elucidation . ”
christie	styles	“ it is just an idea of mine , ” explained lawrence . “ of course i may be quite wrong , but it still seems to me that my mother ’ s death might be accounted for by natural means . ”
christie	styles	“ how do you make that out , mr. cavendish ? ” “ my mother , at the time of her death , and for some time before it , was taking a tonic containing strychnine. ” “ ah ! ” said the coroner .
christie	styles	the jury looked up , interested . “ i believe , ” continued lawrence , “ that there have been cases where the cumulative effect of a drug , administered for some time , has ended by causing death . also , is it not possible that she may have taken an overdose of her medicine by accident ? ”
christie	styles	“ this is the first we have heard of the deceased taking strychnine at the time of her death . we are much obliged to you , mr. cavendish. ” dr. wilkins was recalled and ridiculed the idea .
christie	styles	“ what mr. cavendish suggests is quite impossible . any doctor would tell you the same . strychnine is , in a certain sense , a cumulative poison , but it would be quite impossible for it to result in sudden death in this way . there would have to be a long period of chronic symptoms which would at once have attracted my attention . the whole thing is absurd . ”
christie	styles	“ and the second suggestion ? that mrs. inglethorp may have inadvertently taken an overdose ? ” “ three , or even four doses , would not have resulted in death . mrs. inglethorp always had an extra large amount of medicine made up at a time , as she dealt with coot ’ s , the cash chemists in tadminster . she would have had to take very nearly the whole bottle to account for the amount of strychnine found at the post-mortem . ”
christie	styles	“ then you consider that we may dismiss the tonic as not being in any way instrumental in causing her death ? ” “ certainly . the supposition is ridiculous. ” the same juryman who had interrupted before here suggested that the chemist who made up the medicine might have committed an error .
christie	styles	“ that , of course , is always possible , ” replied the doctor . but dorcas , who was the next witness called , dispelled even that possibility . the medicine had not been newly made up . on the contrary , mrs. inglethorp had taken the last dose on the day of her death .
christie	styles	so the question of the tonic was finally abandoned , and the coroner proceeded with his task . having elicited from dorcas how she had been awakened by the violent ringing of her mistress ’ s bell , and had subsequently roused the household , he passed to the subject of the quarrel on the preceding afternoon .
christie	styles	dorcas ’ s evidence on this point was substantially what poirot and i had already heard , so i will not repeat it here . the next witness was mary cavendish . she stood very upright , and spoke in a low , clear , and perfectly composed voice . in answer to the coroner ’ s question , she told how , her alarm clock having aroused her at four-thirty as usual , she was dressing , when she was startled by the sound of something heavy falling .
christie	styles	“ that would have been the table by the bed ? ” commented the coroner . “ i opened my door , ” continued mary , “ and listened . in a few minutes a bell rang violently . dorcas came running down and woke my husband , and we all went to my mother-in-law ’ s room , but it was locked—— ”
christie	styles	the coroner interrupted her . “ i really do not think we need trouble you further on that point . we know all that can be known of the subsequent happenings . but i should be obliged if you would tell us all you overheard of the quarrel the day before . ”
christie	styles	“ i ? ” there was a faint insolence in her voice . she raised her hand and adjusted the ruffle of lace at her neck , turning her head a little as she did so . and quite spontaneously the thought flashed across my mind : “ she is gaining time ! ”
christie	styles	“ yes . i understand , ” continued the coroner deliberately , “ that you were sitting reading on the bench just outside the long window of the boudoir . that is so , is it not ? ” this was news to me and glancing sideways at poirot , i fancied that it was news to him as well .
christie	styles	there was the faintest pause , the mere hesitation of a moment , before she answered : “ yes , that is so. ” “ and the boudoir window was open , was it not ? ” surely her face grew a little paler as she answered :
christie	styles	“ yes. ” “ then you can not have failed to hear the voices inside , especially as they were raised in anger . in fact , they would be more audible where you were than in the hall . ”
christie	styles	“ possibly. ” “ will you repeat to us what you overheard of the quarrel ? ” “ i really do not remember hearing anything. ” “ do you mean to say you did not hear voices ? ” “ oh , yes , i heard the voices , but i did not hear what they said. ” a faint spot of colour came into her cheek . “ i am not in the habit of listening to private conversations . ”
christie	styles	the coroner persisted . “ and you remember nothing at all ? _nothing_ , mrs. cavendish ? not one stray word or phrase to make you realize that it _was_ a private conversation ? ” she paused , and seemed to reflect , still outwardly as calm as ever .
christie	styles	“ yes ; i remember . mrs. inglethorp said something—i do not remember exactly what—about causing scandal between husband and wife. ” “ ah ! ” the coroner leant back satisfied . “ that corresponds with what dorcas heard . but excuse me , mrs. cavendish , although you realized it was a private conversation , you did not move away ? you remained where you were ? ”
christie	styles	i caught the momentary gleam of her tawny eyes as she raised them . i felt certain that at that moment she would willingly have torn the little lawyer , with his insinuations , into pieces , but she replied quietly enough :
christie	styles	“ no . i was very comfortable where i was . i fixed my mind on my book. ” “ and that is all you can tell us ? ” “ that is all. ” the examination was over , though i doubted if the coroner was entirely satisfied with it . i think he suspected that mary cavendish could tell more if she chose .
christie	styles	amy hill , shop assistant , was next called , and deposed to having sold a will form on the afternoon of the 17th to william earl , under-gardener at styles . william earl and manning succeeded her , and testified to witnessing a document . manning fixed the time at about four-thirty , william was of the opinion that it was rather earlier .
christie	styles	cynthia murdoch came next . she had , however , little to tell . she had known nothing of the tragedy , until awakened by mrs. cavendish . “ you did not hear the table fall ? ” “ no . i was fast asleep . ”
christie	styles	the coroner smiled . “ a good conscience makes a sound sleeper , ” he observed . “ thank you , miss murdoch , that is all. ” “ miss howard. ” miss howard produced the letter written to her by mrs. inglethorp on the evening of the 17th . poirot and i had , of course already seen it . it added nothing to our knowledge of the tragedy . the following is a facsimile :
christie	styles	styles court essex hand written note : july 17th my dear evelyn can we not bury the hachet ? i have found it hard to forgive the things you said against my dear husband but i am an old woman & very fond of you yours affectionately , emily inglethorpe
christie	styles	it was handed to the jury who scrutinized it attentively . “ i fear it does not help us much , ” said the coroner , with a sigh . “ there is no mention of any of the events of that afternoon . ”
christie	styles	“ plain as a pikestaff to me , ” said miss howard shortly . “ it shows clearly enough that my poor old friend had just found out she ’ d been made a fool of ! ” “ it says nothing of the kind in the letter , ” the coroner pointed out .
christie	styles	“ no , because emily never could bear to put herself in the wrong . but _i_ know her . she wanted me back . but she wasn ’ t going to own that i ’ d been right . she went round about . most people do . don ’ t believe in it myself . ”
christie	styles	mr. wells smiled faintly . so , i noticed , did several of the jury . miss howard was obviously quite a public character . “ anyway , all this tomfoolery is a great waste of time , ” continued the lady , glancing up and down the jury disparagingly . “ talk—talk—talk ! when all the time we know perfectly well—— ”
christie	styles	the coroner interrupted her in an agony of apprehension : “ thank you , miss howard , that is all. ” i fancy he breathed a sigh of relief when she complied . then came the sensation of the day . the coroner called albert mace , chemist ’ s assistant .
christie	styles	it was our agitated young man of the pale face . in answer to the coroner ’ s questions , he explained that he was a qualified pharmacist , but had only recently come to this particular shop , as the assistant formerly there had just been called up for the army .
christie	styles	these preliminaries completed , the coroner proceeded to business . “ mr . mace , have you lately sold strychnine to any unauthorized person ? ” “ yes , sir. ” “ when was this ? ” “ last monday night. ” “ monday ? not tuesday ? ”
christie	styles	“ no , sir , monday , the 16th. ” “ will you tell us to whom you sold it ? ” you could have heard a pin drop . “ yes , sir . it was to mr. inglethorp. ” every eye turned simultaneously to where alfred inglethorp was sitting , impassive and wooden . he started slightly , as the damning words fell from the young man ’ s lips . i half thought he was going to rise from his chair , but he remained seated , although a remarkably well acted expression of astonishment rose on his face .
christie	styles	“ you are sure of what you say ? ” asked the coroner sternly . “ quite sure , sir. ” “ are you in the habit of selling strychnine indiscriminately over the counter ? ” the wretched young man wilted visibly under the coroner ’ s frown .
christie	styles	“ oh , no , sir—of course not . but , seeing it was mr. inglethorp of the hall , i thought there was no harm in it . he said it was to poison a dog . ”
christie	styles	inwardly i sympathized . it was only human nature to endeavour to please “ the hall ” —especially when it might result in custom being transferred from coot ’ s to the local establishment . “ is it not customary for anyone purchasing poison to sign a book ? ”
christie	styles	“ yes , sir , mr. inglethorp did so. ” “ have you got the book here ? ” “ yes , sir. ” it was produced ; and , with a few words of stern censure , the coroner dismissed the wretched mr. mace .
christie	styles	then , amidst a breathless silence , alfred inglethorp was called . did he realize , i wondered , how closely the halter was being drawn around his neck ? the coroner went straight to the point .
christie	styles	“ on monday evening last , did you purchase strychnine for the purpose of poisoning a dog ? ” inglethorp replied with perfect calmness : “ no , i did not . there is no dog at styles , except an outdoor sheepdog , which is in perfect health . ”
christie	styles	“ you deny absolutely having purchased strychnine from albert mace on monday last ? ” “ i do. ” “ do you also deny _this_ ? ” the coroner handed him the register in which his signature was inscribed .
christie	styles	“ certainly i do . the hand-writing is quite different from mine . i will show you. ” he took an old envelope out of his pocket , and wrote his name on it , handing it to the jury . it was certainly utterly dissimilar .
christie	styles	“ then what is your explanation of mr. mace ’ s statement ? ” alfred inglethorp replied imperturbably : “ mr . mace must have been mistaken. ” the coroner hesitated for a moment , and then said : “ mr . inglethorp , as a mere matter of form , would you mind telling us where you were on the evening of monday , july 16th ? ”
christie	styles	“ really—i can not remember. ” “ that is absurd , mr. inglethorp , ” said the coroner sharply . “ think again. ” inglethorp shook his head . “ i can not tell you . i have an idea that i was out walking . ”
christie	styles	“ in what direction ? ” “ i really can ’ t remember. ” the coroner ’ s face grew graver . “ were you in company with anyone ? ” “ no. ” “ did you meet anyone on your walk ? ” “ no. ” “ that is a pity , ” said the coroner dryly . “ i am to take it then that you decline to say where you were at the time that mr. mace positively recognized you as entering the shop to purchase strychnine ? ”
christie	styles	“ if you like to take it that way , yes. ” “ be careful , mr. inglethorp. ” poirot was fidgeting nervously . “ _sacré ! _ ” he murmured . “ does this imbecile of a man _want_ to be arrested ? ”
christie	styles	inglethorp was indeed creating a bad impression . his futile denials would not have convinced a child . the coroner , however , passed briskly to the next point , and poirot drew a deep breath of relief .
christie	styles	“ you had a discussion with your wife on tuesday afternoon ? ” “ pardon me , ” interrupted alfred inglethorp , “ you have been misinformed . i had no quarrel with my dear wife . the whole story is absolutely untrue . i was absent from the house the entire afternoon . ”
christie	styles	“ have you anyone who can testify to that ? ” “ you have my word , ” said inglethorp haughtily . the coroner did not trouble to reply . “ there are two witnesses who will swear to having heard your disagreement with mrs. inglethorp . ”
christie	styles	“ those witnesses were mistaken. ” i was puzzled . the man spoke with such quiet assurance that i was staggered . i looked at poirot . there was an expression of exultation on his face which i could not understand . was he at last convinced of alfred inglethorp ’ s guilt ?
christie	styles	“ mr . inglethorp , ” said the coroner , “ you have heard your wife ’ s dying words repeated here . can you explain them in any way ? ” “ certainly i can. ” “ you can ? ” “ it seems to me very simple . the room was dimly lighted . dr. bauerstein is much of my height and build , and , like me , wears a beard . in the dim light , and suffering as she was , my poor wife mistook him for me . ”
christie	styles	“ ah ! ” murmured poirot to himself . “ but it is an idea , that ! ” “ you think it is true ? ” i whispered . “ i do not say that . but it is truly an ingenious supposition . ”
christie	styles	“ you read my wife ’ s last words as an accusation ” —inglethorp was continuing— “ they were , on the contrary , an appeal to me. ” the coroner reflected a moment , then he said : “ i believe , mr. inglethorp , that you yourself poured out the coffee , and took it to your wife that evening ? ”
christie	styles	“ i poured it out , yes . but i did not take it to her . i meant to do so , but i was told that a friend was at the hall door , so i laid down the coffee on the hall table . when i came through the hall again a few minutes later , it was gone . ”
christie	styles	this statement might , or might not , be true , but it did not seem to me to improve matters much for inglethorp . in any case , he had had ample time to introduce the poison .
christie	styles	at that point , poirot nudged me gently , indicating two men who were sitting together near the door . one was a little , sharp , dark , ferret-faced man , the other was tall and fair .
christie	styles	i questioned poirot mutely . he put his lips to my ear . “ do you know who that little man is ? ” i shook my head . “ that is detective inspector james japp of scotland yard—jimmy japp . the other man is from scotland yard too . things are moving quickly , my friend . ”
christie	styles	i stared at the two men intently . there was certainly nothing of the policeman about them . i should never have suspected them of being official personages . i was still staring , when i was startled and recalled by the verdict being given :
christie	styles	“ wilful murder against some person or persons unknown. ” chapter vii . poirot pays his debts as we came out of the stylites arms , poirot drew me aside by a gentle pressure of the arm . i understood his object . he was waiting for the scotland yard men .
christie	styles	in a few moments , they emerged , and poirot at once stepped forward , and accosted the shorter of the two . “ i fear you do not remember me , inspector japp. ” “ why , if it isn ’ t mr. poirot ! ” cried the inspector . he turned to the other man . “ you ’ ve heard me speak of mr. poirot ? it was in 1904 he and i worked together—the abercrombie forgery case—you remember , he was run down in brussels . ah , those were great days , moosier . then , do you remember ‘ baron ’ altara ? there was a pretty rogue for you ! he eluded the clutches of half the police in europe . but we nailed him in antwerp—thanks to mr. poirot here . ”
christie	styles	as these friendly reminiscences were being indulged in , i drew nearer , and was introduced to detective-inspector japp , who , in his turn , introduced us both to his companion , superintendent summerhaye . “ i need hardly ask what you are doing here , gentlemen , ” remarked poirot .
christie	styles	japp closed one eye knowingly . “ no , indeed . pretty clear case i should say. ” but poirot answered gravely : “ there i differ from you. ” “ oh , come ! ” said summerhaye , opening his lips for the first time . “ surely the whole thing is clear as daylight . the man ’ s caught red-handed . how he could be such a fool beats me ! ”
christie	styles	but japp was looking attentively at poirot . “ hold your fire , summerhaye , ” he remarked jocularly . “ me and moosier here have met before—and there ’ s no man ’ s judgment i ’ d sooner take than his . if i ’ m not greatly mistaken , he ’ s got something up his sleeve . isn ’ t that so , moosier ? ”
melville	moby	“ the devil he does , ” says i . “ where is that harpooneer ? is he here ? ” “ he ’ ll be here afore long , ” was the answer . i could not help it , but i began to feel suspicious of this “ dark complexioned ” harpooneer . at any rate , i made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together , he must undress and get into bed before i did .
melville	moby	“ and pray , sir , what in the world is equal to it ? ” —_edmund burke ’ s reference in parliament to the nantucket whale-fishery_ . “ spain—a great whale stranded on the shores of europe. ” —_edmund burke_ . ( _somewhere_ . )
melville	moby	no town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one—i mean a downright bumpkin dandy—a fellow that , in the dog-days , will mow his two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands . now when a country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished reputation , and joins the great whale-fishery , you should see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport . in bespeaking his sea-outfit , he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats ; straps to his canvas trowsers . ah , poor hay-seed ! how bitterly will burst those straps in the first howling gale , when thou art driven , straps , buttons , and all , down the throat of the tempest .
melville	moby	now , with the subordinate phantoms , what wonder remained soon waned away ; for in a whaler wonders soon wane . besides , now and then such unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown nooks and ash-holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of whalers ; and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks , bits of wreck , oars , whaleboats , canoes , blown-off japanese junks , and what not ; that beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin to chat with the captain , and it would not create any unsubduable excitement in the forecastle .
melville	moby	“ nantucket itself , ” said mr. webster , “ is a very striking and peculiar portion of the national interest . there is a population of eight or nine thousand persons living here in the sea , adding largely every year to the national wealth by the boldest and most persevering industry. ” —_report of daniel webster ’ s speech in the u. s. senate , on the application for the erection of a breakwater at nantucket_ . 1828 .
melville	moby	thus we were weaving and weaving away when i started at a sound so strange , long drawn , and musically wild and unearthly , that the ball of free will dropped from my hand , and i stood gazing up at the clouds whence that voice dropped like a wing . high aloft in the cross-trees was that mad gay-header , tashtego . his body was reaching eagerly forward , his hand stretched out like a wand , and at brief sudden intervals he continued his cries . to be sure the same sound was that very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas , from hundreds of whalemen ’ s look-outs perched as high in the air ; but from few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous cadence as from tashtego the indian ’ s .
melville	moby	let us try . but in a matter like this , subtlety appeals to subtlety , and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls . and though , doubtless , some at least of the imaginative impressions about to be presented may have been shared by most men , yet few perhaps were entirely conscious of them at the time , and therefore may not be able to recall them now .
melville	moby	in disposing of the body of a right whale , when brought alongside the ship , the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the case of a sperm whale ; only , in the latter instance , the head is cut off whole , but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck , with all the well known black bone attached to what is called the crown-piece . but nothing like this , in the present case , had been done . the carcases of both whales had dropped astern ; and the head-laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of overburdening panniers .
melville	moby	“ morning to ye , shipmates , morning. ” “ morning it is , ” said i . “ come along , queequeg , let ’ s leave this crazy man . but stop , tell me your name , will you ? ” “ elijah. ” elijah ! thought i , and we walked away , both commenting , after each other ’ s fashion , upon this ragged old sailor ; and agreed that he was nothing but a humbug , trying to be a bugbear . but we had not gone perhaps above a hundred yards , when chancing to turn a corner , and looking back as i did so , who should be seen but elijah following us , though at a distance . somehow , the sight of him struck me so , that i said nothing to queequeg of his being behind , but passed on with my comrade , anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner that we did . he did ; and then it seemed to me that he was dogging us , but with what intent i could not for the life of me imagine . this circumstance , coupled with his ambiguous , half-hinting , half-revealing , shrouded sort of talk , now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments and half-apprehensions , and all connected with the pequod ; and captain ahab ; and the leg he had lost ; and the cape horn fit ; and the silver calabash ; and what captain peleg had said of him , when i left the ship the day previous ; and the prediction of the squaw tistig ; and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail ; and a hundred other shadowy things .
melville	moby	here , then , was this grey-headed , ungodly old man , chasing with curses a job ’ s whale round the world , at the head of a crew , too , chiefly made up of mongrel renegades , and castaways , and cannibals—morally enfeebled also , by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in starbuck , the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in stubb , and the pervading mediocrity in flask . such a crew , so officered , seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac revenge . how it was that they so aboundingly responded to the old man ’ s ire—by what evil magic their souls were possessed , that at times his hate seemed almost theirs ; the white whale as much their insufferable foe as his ; how all this came to be—what the white whale was to them , or how to their unconscious understandings , also , in some dim , unsuspected way , he might have seemed the gliding great demon of the seas of life , —all this to explain , would be to dive deeper than ishmael can go . the subterranean miner that works in us all , how can one tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting , muffled sound of his pick ? who does not feel the irresistible arm drag ? what skiff in tow of a seventy-four can stand still ? for one , i gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the place ; but while yet all a-rush to encounter the whale , could see naught in that brute but the deadliest ill .
melville	moby	“ i do , sir. ” “ very good . now , art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale ’ s throat , and then jump after it ? answer , quick ! ” “ i am , sir , if it should be positively indispensable to do so ; not to be got rid of , that is ; which i don ’ t take to be the fact . ”
melville	moby	“ he ’ s too sound asleep , mr. stubb ; go thou down , and wake him , and tell him . i must see to the deck here . thou know ’ st what to say. ” chapter 124 . the needle .
melville	moby	so , almost every twenty-four hours , when the watches of the night were set , and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below ; and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle , the sailors flung it not rudely down , as by day , but with some cautiousness dropt it to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates ; when this sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail , habitually , the silent steersman would watch the cabin-scuttle ; and ere long the old man would emerge , gripping at the iron banister , to help his crippled way . some considering touch of humanity was in him ; for at times like these , he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck ; because to his wearied mates , seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel , such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony step , that their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of sharks . but once , the mood was on him too deep for common regardings ; and as with heavy , lumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast , stubb , the old second mate , came up from below , with a certain unassured , deprecating humorousness , hinted that if captain ahab was pleased to walk the planks , then , no one could say nay ; but there might be some way of muffling the noise ; hinting something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow , and the insertion into it , of the ivory heel . ah ! stubb , thou didst not know ahab then .
melville	moby	“ the harpoon , ” said ahab , half way rising , and draggingly leaning on one bended arm— “ is it safe ? ” “ aye , sir , for it was not darted ; this is it , ” said stubb , showing it .
melville	moby	then again , there is an imposing quarto , written by one captain colnett , a post captain in the english navy , entitled “ a voyage round cape horn into the south seas , for the purpose of extending the spermaceti whale fisheries. ” in this book is an outline purporting to be a “ picture of a physeter or spermaceti whale , drawn by scale from one killed on the coast of mexico , august , 1793 , and hoisted on deck. ” i doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for the benefit of his marines . to mention but one thing about it , let me say that it has an eye which applied , according to the accompanying scale , to a full grown sperm whale , would make the eye of that whale a bow-window some five feet long . ah , my gallant captain , why did ye not give us jonah looking out of that eye !
melville	moby	i have hinted that i would often jerk poor queequeg from between the whale and the ship—where he would occasionally fall , from the incessant rolling and swaying of both . but this was not the only jamming jeopardy he was exposed to . unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the night , the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent blood which began to flow from the carcass—the rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive .
melville	moby	“ ‘ then i must get some from old rad ; ’ and he rose to go aft . “ ‘ you don ’ t mean to go a begging to _him ! _ ’ said a sailor . “ ‘ why not ? do you think he won ’ t do me a turn , when it ’ s to help himself in the end , shipmate ? ’ and going to the mate , he looked at him quietly , and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock . it was given him—neither twine nor lanyard were seen again ; but the next night an iron ball , closely netted , partly rolled from the pocket of the lakeman ’ s monkey jacket , as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for a pillow . twenty-four hours after , his trick at the silent helm—nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to the seaman ’ s hand—that fatal hour was then to come ; and in the fore-ordaining soul of steelkilt , the mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse , with his forehead crushed in .
melville	moby	“ what has he in his hand there ? ” cried starbuck , pointing to something wavingly held by the german . “ impossible ! —a lamp-feeder ! ” “ not that , ” said stubb , “ no , no , it ’ s a coffee-pot , mr. starbuck ; he ’ s coming off to make us our coffee , is the yarman ; don ’ t you see that big tin can there alongside of him ? —that ’ s his boiling water . oh ! he ’ s all right , is the yarman . ”
melville	moby	“ i fear not thy epidemic , man , ” said ahab from the bulwarks , to captain mayhew , who stood in the boat ’ s stern ; “ come on board. ” but now gabriel started to his feet .
melville	moby	in connection with this appellative of “ whalebone whales , ” it is of great importance to mention , that however such a nomenclature may be convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales , yet it is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the leviathan , founded upon either his baleen , or hump , or fin , or teeth ; notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions , which the whale , in his kinds , presents . how then ? the baleen , hump , back-fin , and teeth ; these are things whose peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales , without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential particulars . thus , the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale , each has a hump ; but there the similitude ceases . then , this same humpbacked whale and the greenland whale , each of these has baleen ; but there again the similitude ceases . and it is just the same with the other parts above mentioned . in various sorts of whales , they form such irregular combinations ; or , in the case of any one of them detached , such an irregular isolation ; as utterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis . on this rock every one of the whale-naturalists has split .
melville	moby	but why should the king have the head , and the queen the tail ? a reason for that , ye lawyers ! in his treatise on “ queen-gold , ” or queen-pinmoney , an old king ’ s bench author , one william prynne , thus discourseth : “ ye tail is ye queen ’ s , that ye queen ’ s wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone. ” now this was written at a time when the black limber bone of the greenland or right whale was largely used in ladies ’ bodices . but this same bone is not in the tail ; it is in the head , which is a sad mistake for a sagacious lawyer like prynne . but is the queen a mermaid , to be presented with a tail ? an allegorical meaning may lurk here .
melville	moby	“ it was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow for her island haven , that the town-ho ’ s leak seemed again increasing , but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day . you must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our atlantic , for example , some skippers think little of pumping their whole way across it ; though of a still , sleepy night , should the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect , the probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it , on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom . nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward , gentlemen , is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length ; that is , if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast , or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded them . it is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waters , some really landless latitude , that her captain begins to feel a little anxious .
melville	moby	“ here they saw such huge troops of whales , that they were forced to proceed with a great deal of caution for fear they should run their ship upon them. ” —_schouten ’ s sixth circumnavigation_ .
melville	moby	a word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the whale . it has already been said , that it is stript from him in long pieces , called blanket-pieces . like most sea-terms , this one is very happy and significant . for the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real blanket or counterpane ; or , still better , an indian poncho slipt over his head , and skirting his extremity . it is by reason of this cosy blanketing of his body , that the whale is enabled to keep himself comfortable in all weathers , in all seas , times , and tides . what would become of a greenland whale , say , in those shuddering , icy seas of the north , if unsupplied with his cosy surtout ? true , other fish are found exceedingly brisk in those hyperborean waters ; but these , be it observed , are your cold-blooded , lungless fish , whose very bellies are refrigerators ; creatures , that warm themselves under the lee of an iceberg , as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire ; whereas , like man , the whale has lungs and warm blood . freeze his blood , and he dies . how wonderful is it then—except after explanation—that this great monster , to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is to man ; how wonderful that he should be found at home , immersed to his lips for life in those arctic waters ! where , when seamen fall overboard , they are sometimes found , months afterwards , perpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice , as a fly is found glued in amber . but more surprising is it to know , as has been proved by experiment , that the blood of a polar whale is warmer than that of a borneo negro in summer .
melville	moby	while he was speaking these words , the howling of the shrieking , slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher , who , when describing jonah ’ s sea-storm , seemed tossed by a storm himself . his deep chest heaved as with a ground-swell ; his tossed arms seemed the warring elements at work ; and the thunders that rolled away from off his swarthy brow , and the light leaping from his eye , made all his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them .
melville	moby	“ what breaks in me ? some sinew cracks ! — ’ tis whole again ; oars ! oars ! burst in upon him ! ” hearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat , the whale wheeled round to present his blank forehead at bay ; but in that evolution , catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship ; seemingly seeing in it the source of all his persecutions ; bethinking it—it may be—a larger and nobler foe ; of a sudden , he bore down upon its advancing prow , smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam .
melville	moby	look at the sailor , called the mincer , who now comes along , and assisted by two allies , heavily backs the grandissimus , as the mariners call it , and with bowed shoulders , staggers off with it as if he were a grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field . extending it upon the forecastle deck , he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt , as an african hunter the pelt of a boa . this done he turns the pelt inside out , like a pantaloon leg ; gives it a good stretching , so as almost to double its diameter ; and at last hangs it , well spread , in the rigging , to dry . ere long , it is taken down ; when removing some three feet of it , towards the pointed extremity , and then cutting two slits for arm-holes at the other end , he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it . the mincer now stands before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling . immemorial to all his order , this investiture alone will adequately protect him , while employed in the peculiar functions of his office .

melville	moby	to sailors , oaths are household words ; they will swear in the trance of the calm , and in the teeth of the tempest ; they will imprecate curses from the topsail-yard-arms , when most they teeter over to a seething sea ; but in all my voyagings , seldom have i heard a common oath when god ’ s burning finger has been laid on the ship ; when his “ mene , mene , tekel upharsin ” has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage .
melville	moby	let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us ; for though the creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely represented of a griffin-like shape , and though the battle is depicted on land and the saint on horseback , yet considering the great ignorance of those times , when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists ; and considering that as in perseus ’ case , st. george ’ s whale might have crawled up out of the sea on the beach ; and considering that the animal ridden by st. george might have been only a large seal , or sea-horse ; bearing all this in mind , it will not appear altogether incompatible with the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene , to hold this so-called dragon no other than the great leviathan himself . in fact , placed before the strict and piercing truth , this whole story will fare like that fish , flesh , and fowl idol of the philistines , dagon by name ; who being planted before the ark of israel , his horse ’ s head and both the palms of his hands fell off from him , and only the stump or fishy part of him remained . thus , then , one of our own noble stamp , even a whaleman , is the tutelary guardian of england ; and by good rights , we harpooneers of nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order of st. george . and therefore , let not the knights of that honorable company ( none of whom , i venture to say , have ever had to do with a whale like their great patron ) , let them never eye a nantucketer with disdain , since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are much better entitled to st. george ’ s decoration than they .

melville	moby	i was a good christian ; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible presbyterian church . how then could i unite with this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood ? but what is worship ? thought i . do you suppose now , ishmael , that the magnanimous god of heaven and earth—pagans and all included—can possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood ? impossible ! but what is worship ? —to do the will of god—_that_ is worship . and what is the will of god ? —to do to my fellow man what i would have my fellow man to do to me—_that_ is the will of god . now , queequeg is my fellow man . and what do i wish that this queequeg would do to me ? why , unite with me in my particular presbyterian form of worship . consequently , i must then unite with him in his ; ergo , i must turn idolator . so i kindled the shavings ; helped prop up the innocent little idol ; offered him burnt biscuit with queequeg ; salamed before him twice or thrice ; kissed his nose ; and that done , we undressed and went to bed , at peace with our own consciences and all the world . but we did not go to sleep without some little chat .
melville	moby	“ terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul . in all his cringing attitudes , the god-fugitive is now too plainly known . the sailors mark him ; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him , and at last , fully to test the truth , by referring the whole matter to high heaven , they fall to casting lots , to see for whose cause this great tempest was upon them . the lot is jonah ’ s ; that discovered , then how furiously they mob him with their questions . ‘ what is thine occupation ? whence comest thou ? thy country ? what people ? but mark now , my shipmates , the behavior of poor jonah . the eager mariners but ask him who he is , and where from ; whereas , they not only receive an answer to those questions , but likewise another answer to a question not put by them , but the unsolicited answer is forced from jonah by the hard hand of god that is upon him .
melville	moby	i was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged elijah was really dogging us or not , and with that intent crossed the way with queequeg , and on that side of it retraced our steps . but elijah passed on , without seeming to notice us . this relieved me ; and once more , and finally as it seemed to me , i pronounced him in my heart , a humbug .

melville	moby	but already the sable wing was before the old man ’ s eyes ; the long hooked bill at his head : with a scream , the black hawk darted away with his prize . an eagle flew thrice round tarquin ’ s head , removing his cap to replace it , and thereupon tanaquil , his wife , declared that tarquin would be king of rome . but only by the replacing of the cap was that omen accounted good . ahab ’ s hat was never restored ; the wild hawk flew on and on with it ; far in advance of the prow : and at last disappeared ; while from the point of that disappearance , a minute black spot was dimly discerned , falling from that vast height into the sea .
melville	moby	cape of good hope , do they call ye ? rather cape tormentoso , as called of yore ; for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had attended us , we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea , where guilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish , seemed condemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store , or beat that black air without any horizon . but calm , snow-white , and unvarying ; still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky ; still beckoning us on from before , the solitary jet would at times be descried .
melville	moby	like captain peleg , captain bildad was a well-to-do , retired whaleman . but unlike captain peleg—who cared not a rush for what are called serious things , and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the veriest of all trifles—captain bildad had not only been originally educated according to the strictest sect of nantucket quakerism , but all his subsequent ocean life , and the sight of many unclad , lovely island creatures , round the horn—all that had not moved this native born quaker one single jot , had not so much as altered one angle of his vest . still , for all this immutableness , was there some lack of common consistency about worthy captain bildad . though refusing , from conscientious scruples , to bear arms against land invaders , yet himself had illimitably invaded the atlantic and pacific ; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed , yet had he in his straight-bodied coat , spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore . how now in the contemplative evening of his days , the pious bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence , i do not know ; but it did not seem to concern him much , and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man ’ s religion is one thing , and this practical world quite another . this world pays dividends . rising from a little cabin-boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab , to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied waistcoat ; from that becoming boat-header , chief-mate , and captain , and finally a ship owner ; bildad , as i hinted before , had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of sixty , and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his well-earned income .
melville	moby	belated , and not innocently , one bitter winter ’ s midnight , on the road running between two country towns , the blacksmith half-stupidly felt the deadly numbness stealing over him , and sought refuge in a leaning , dilapidated barn . the issue was , the loss of the extremities of both feet . out of this revelation , part by part , at last came out the four acts of the gladness , and the one long , and as yet uncatastrophied fifth act of the grief of his life ’ s drama .

melville	moby	the next day was exceedingly still and sultry , and with nothing special to engage them , the pequod ’ s crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep induced by such a vacant sea . for this part of the indian ocean through which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground ; that is , it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises , dolphins , flying-fish , and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters , than those off the rio de la plata , or the in-shore ground off peru .

melville	moby	secondly : people ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is an enormous creature of enormous power ; but i have ever found that when narrating to them some specific example of this two-fold enormousness , they have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness ; when , i declare upon my soul , i had no more idea of being facetious than moses , when he wrote the history of the plagues of egypt .

melville	moby	it may be but an idle whim , but it has always seemed to me , that the extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when beset by three or four boats ; the timidity and liability to queer frights , so common to such whales ; i think that all this indirectly proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition , in which their divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them .
melville	moby	but it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at all reminded one of mowers . seen from the mast-heads , especially when they paused and were stationary for a while , their vast black forms looked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else . and as in the great hunting countries of india , the stranger at a distance will sometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them to be such , taking them for bare , blackened elevations of the soil ; even so , often , with him , who for the first time beholds this species of the leviathans of the sea . and even when recognised at last , their immense magnitude renders it very hard really to believe that such bulky masses of overgrowth can possibly be instinct , in all parts , with the same sort of life that lives in a dog or a horse .
melville	moby	consider all this ; and then turn to this green , gentle , and most docile earth ; consider them both , the sea and the land ; and do you not find a strange analogy to something in yourself ? for as this appalling ocean surrounds the verdant land , so in the soul of man there lies one insular tahiti , full of peace and joy , but encompassed by all the horrors of the half known life . god keep thee ! push not off from that isle , thou canst never return !
melville	moby	“ during the night , radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the bulwarks of the quarter-deck , and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the boat which was hoisted up there , a little above the ship ’ s side . in this attitude , it was well known , he sometimes dozed . there was a considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship , and down between this was the sea . steelkilt calculated his time , and found that his next trick at the helm would come round at two o ’ clock , in the morning of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed . at his leisure , he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in his watches below .
melville	moby	but quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the parsee was nowhere to be found . “ aye , sir , ” said stubb— “ caught among the tangles of your line—i thought i saw him dragging under . ”
melville	moby	the ship named after him was worthy of the honor , being a very fast sailer and a noble craft every way . i boarded her once at midnight somewhere off the patagonian coast , and drank good flip down in the forecastle . it was a fine gam we had , and they were all trumps—every soul on board . a short life to them , and a jolly death . and that fine gam i had—long , very long after old ahab touched her planks with his ivory heel—it minds me of the noble , solid , saxon hospitality of that ship ; and may my parson forget me , and the devil remember me , if i ever lose sight of it . flip ? did i say we had flip ? yes , and we flipped it at the rate of ten gallons the hour ; and when the squall came ( for it ’ s squally off there by patagonia ) , and all hands—visitors and all—were called to reef topsails , we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each other aloft in bowlines ; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our jackets into the sails , so that we hung there , reefed fast in the howling gale , a warning example to all drunken tars . however , the masts did not go overboard ; and by and by we scrambled down , so sober , that we had to pass the flip again , though the savage salt spray bursting down the forecastle scuttle , rather too much diluted and pickled it to my taste .
melville	moby	from the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of the boat , and from its now being more tight than a harpstring , you would have thought the craft had two keels—one cleaving the water , the other the air—as the boat churned on through both opposing elements at once . a continual cascade played at the bows ; a ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake ; and , at the slightest motion from within , even but of a little finger , the vibrating , cracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea . thus they rushed ; each man with might and main clinging to his seat , to prevent being tossed to the foam ; and the tall form of tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double , in order to bring down his centre of gravity . whole atlantics and pacifics seemed passed as they shot on their way , till at length the whale somewhat slackened his flight .
melville	moby	but no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke , than all three tigers—queequeg , tashtego , daggoo—instinctively sprang to their feet , and standing in a diagonal row , simultaneously pointed their barbs ; and darted over the head of the german harpooneer , their three nantucket irons entered the whale . blinding vapors of foam and white-fire ! the three boats , in the first fury of the whale ’ s headlong rush , bumped the german ’ s aside with such force , that both derick and his baffled harpooneer were spilled out , and sailed over by the three flying keels .
melville	moby	marking all this , stubb argued well for his scheme , and turning to the guernsey-man had a little chat with him , during which the stranger mate expressed his detestation of his captain as a conceited ignoramus , who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle . sounding him carefully , stubb further perceived that the guernsey-man had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris . he therefore held his peace on that head , but otherwise was quite frank and confidential with him , so that the two quickly concocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the captain , without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity . according to this little plan of theirs , the guernsey-man , under cover of an interpreter ’ s office , was to tell the captain what he pleased , but as coming from stubb ; and as for stubb , he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview .
melville	moby	chapter 129 . the cabin . ( _ahab moving to go on deck ; pip catches him by the hand to follow._ ) “ lad , lad , i tell thee thou must not follow ahab now . the hour is coming when ahab would not scare thee from him , yet would not have thee by him . there is that in thee , poor lad , which i feel too curing to my malady . like cures like ; and for this hunt , my malady becomes my most desired health . do thou abide below here , where they shall serve thee , as if thou wert the captain . aye , lad , thou shalt sit here in my own screwed chair ; another screw to it , thou must be . ”
melville	moby	again , if the dart be successful , then at the second critical instant , that is , when the whale starts to run , the boatheader and harpooneer likewise start to running fore and aft , to the imminent jeopardy of themselves and every one else . it is then they change places ; and the headsman , the chief officer of the little craft , takes his proper station in the bows of the boat .
melville	moby	chapter 101 . the decanter . ere the english ship fades from sight , be it set down here , that she hailed from london , and was named after the late samuel enderby , merchant of that city , the original of the famous whaling house of enderby & sons ; a house which in my poor whaleman ’ s opinion , comes not far behind the united royal houses of the tudors and bourbons , in point of real historical interest . how long , prior to the year of our lord 1775 , this great whaling house was in existence , my numerous fish-documents do not make plain ; but in that year ( 1775 ) it fitted out the first english ships that ever regularly hunted the sperm whale ; though for some score of years previous ( ever since 1726 ) our valiant coffins and maceys of nantucket and the vineyard had in large fleets pursued that leviathan , but only in the north and south atlantic : not elsewhere . be it distinctly recorded here , that the nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great sperm whale ; and that for half a century they were the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him .
melville	moby	almost simultaneously , with a mighty volition of ungraduated , instantaneous swiftness , the white whale darted through the weltering sea . but when ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with the line , and hold it so ; and commanded the crew to turn round on their seats , and tow the boat up to the mark ; the moment the treacherous line felt that double strain and tug , it snapped in the empty air !
melville	moby	“ ‘ who ’ s there ? ’ cries the captain at his busy desk , hurriedly making out his papers for the customs— ‘ who ’ s there ? ’ oh ! how that harmless question mangles jonah ! for the instant he almost turns to flee again . but he rallies . ‘ i seek a passage in this ship to tarshish ; how soon sail ye , sir ? ’ thus far the busy captain had not looked up to jonah , though the man now stands before him ; but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice , than he darts a scrutinizing glance . ‘ we sail with the next coming tide , ’ at last he slowly answered , still intently eyeing him . ‘ no sooner , sir ? ’ — ‘ soon enough for any honest man that goes a passenger. ’ ha ! jonah , that ’ s another stab . but he swiftly calls away the captain from that scent . ‘ i ’ ll sail with ye , ’ —he says , — ‘ the passage money how much is that ? —i ’ ll pay now. ’ for it is particularly written , shipmates , as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history , ‘ that he paid the fare thereof ’ ere the craft did sail . and taken with the context , this is full of meaning .

melville	moby	moreover : we are to consider , that from the presumed great longevity of whales , their probably attaining the age of a century and more , therefore at any one period of time , several distinct adult generations must be contemporary . and what that is , we may soon gain some idea of , by imagining all the grave-yards , cemeteries , and family vaults of creation yielding up the live bodies of all the men , women , and children who were alive seventy-five years ago ; and adding this countless host to the present human population of the globe .
melville	moby	why tell the whole ? the blows of the basement hammer every day grew more and more between ; and each blow every day grew fainter than the last ; the wife sat frozen at the window , with tearless eyes , glitteringly gazing into the weeping faces of her children ; the bellows fell ; the forge choked up with cinders ; the house was sold ; the mother dived down into the long church-yard grass ; her children twice followed her thither ; and the houseless , familyless old man staggered off a vagabond in crape ; his every woe unreverenced ; his grey head a scorn to flaxen curls !
melville	moby	or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and kings ( which will not wholly account for it ) that makes the white tower of london tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an untravelled american , than those other storied structures , its neighbors—the byward tower , or even the bloody ? and those sublimer towers , the white mountains of new hampshire , whence , in peculiar moods , comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of that name , while the thought of virginia ’ s blue ridge is full of a soft , dewy , distant dreaminess ? or why , irrespective of all latitudes and longitudes , does the name of the white sea exert such a spectralness over the fancy , while that of the yellow sea lulls us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves , followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets ? or , to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance , purely addressed to the fancy , why , in reading the old fairy tales of central europe , does “ the tall pale man ” of the hartz forests , whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides through the green of the groves—why is this phantom more terrible than all the whooping imps of the blocksburg ?
melville	moby	again : as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and prophesies of the storm , is perhaps more awful than the storm itself ; for , indeed , the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm ; and contains it in itself , as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal powder , and the ball , and the explosion ; so the graceful repose of the line , as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought into actual play—this is a thing which carries more of true terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair . but why say more ? all men live enveloped in whale-lines . all are born with halters round their necks ; but it is only when caught in the swift , sudden turn of death , that mortals realize the silent , subtle , ever-present perils of life . and if you be a philosopher , though seated in the whale-boat , you would not at heart feel one whit more of terror , than though seated before your evening fire with a poker , and not a harpoon , by your side .
melville	moby	“ haul in—haul in ! ” cried stubb to the bowsman ! and , facing round towards the whale , all hands began pulling the boat up to him , while yet the boat was being towed on . soon ranging up by his flank , stubb , firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat , darted dart after dart into the flying fish ; at the word of command , the boat alternately sterning out of the way of the whale ’ s horrible wallow , and then ranging up for another fling .
melville	moby	instantly the captain ran forward , and in a loud voice commanded his crew to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles , and at once cast loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship .
melville	moby	now , in his heart , ahab had some glimpse of this , namely : all my means are sane , my motive and my object mad . yet without power to kill , or change , or shun the fact ; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long dissemble ; in some sort , did still . but that thing of his dissembling was only subject to his perceptibility , not to his will determinate . nevertheless , so well did he succeed in that dissembling , that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last , no nantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved , and that to the quick , with the terrible casualty which had overtaken him .
melville	moby	now , from this peculiar sideway position of the whale ’ s eyes , it is plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead , no more than he can one exactly astern . in a word , the position of the whale ’ s eyes corresponds to that of a man ’ s ears ; and you may fancy , for yourself , how it would fare with you , did you sideways survey objects through your ears . you would find that you could only command some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side-line of sight ; and about thirty more behind it . if your bitterest foe were walking straight towards you , with dagger uplifted in broad day , you would not be able to see him , any more than if he were stealing upon you from behind . in a word , you would have two backs , so to speak ; but , at the same time , also , two fronts ( side fronts ) : for what is it that makes the front of a man—what , indeed , but his eyes ?
melville	moby	“ no , we hav ’ n ’ t . he ’ s sick they say , but is getting better , and will be all right again before long. ” “ all right again before long ! ” laughed the stranger , with a solemnly derisive sort of laugh . “ look ye ; when captain ahab is all right , then this left arm of mine will be all right ; not before . ”
melville	moby	“ let us fly , let us fly ! old nick take me if it is not leviathan described by the noble prophet moses in the life of patient job. ” —_rabelais_ . “ this whale ’ s liver was two cartloads. ” —_stowe ’ s annals_ .
melville	moby	i partly surmise also , that this wicked charge against whalers may be likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of greenland , in former times , of a dutch village called schmerenburgh or smeerenberg , which latter name is the one used by the learned fogo von slack , in his great work on smells , a text-book on that subject . as its name imports ( smeer , fat ; berg , to put up ) , this village was founded in order to afford a place for the blubber of the dutch whale fleet to be tried out , without being taken home to holland for that purpose . it was a collection of furnaces , fat-kettles , and oil sheds ; and when the works were in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor . but all this is quite different with a south sea sperm whaler ; which in a voyage of four years perhaps , after completely filling her hold with oil , does not , perhaps , consume fifty days in the business of boiling out ; and in the state that it is casked , the oil is nearly scentless . the truth is , that living or dead , if but decently treated , whales as a species are by no means creatures of ill odor ; nor can whalemen be recognised , as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a jew in the company , by the nose . nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant , when , as a general thing , he enjoys such high health ; taking abundance of exercise ; always out of doors ; though , it is true , seldom in the open air . i say , that the motion of a sperm whale ’ s flukes above water dispenses a perfume , as when a musk-scented lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor . what then shall i liken the sperm whale to for fragrance , considering his magnitude ? must it not be to that famous elephant , with jewelled tusks , and redolent with myrrh , which was led out of an indian town to do honor to alexander the great ?
melville	moby	supper concluded , we received a lamp , and directions from mrs. hussey concerning the nearest way to bed ; but , as queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs , the lady reached forth her arm , and demanded his harpoon ; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers . “ why not ? ” said i ; “ every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon—but why not ? ” “ because it ’ s dangerous , ” says she . “ ever since young stiggs coming from that unfort ’ nt v ’ y ’ ge of his , when he was gone four years and a half , with only three barrels of _ile_ , was found dead in my first floor back , with his harpoon in his side ; ever since then i allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night . so , mr. queequeg ” ( for she had learned his name ) , “ i will just take this here iron , and keep it for you till morning . but the chowder ; clam or cod to-morrow for breakfast , men ? ”
melville	moby	“ bildad , ” cried captain peleg , “ at it again , bildad , eh ? ye have been studying those scriptures , now , for the last thirty years , to my certain knowledge . how far ye got , bildad ? ”
melville	moby	“ thou bildad ! ” roared peleg , starting up and clattering about the cabin . “ blast ye , captain bildad , if i had followed thy advice in these matters , i would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round cape horn . ”
melville	moby	there is , one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea , whose gently awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath ; like those fabled undulations of the ephesian sod over the buried evangelist st. john . and meet it is , that over these sea-pastures , wide-rolling watery prairies and potters ’ fields of all four continents , the waves should rise and fall , and ebb and flow unceasingly ; for here , millions of mixed shades and shadows , drowned dreams , somnambulisms , reveries ; all that we call lives and souls , lie dreaming , dreaming , still ; tossing like slumberers in their beds ; the ever-rolling waves but made so by their restlessness .
melville	moby	another thing . flask was the last person down at the dinner , and flask is the first man up . consider ! for hereby flask ’ s dinner was badly jammed in point of time . starbuck and stubb both had the start of him ; and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear . if stubb even , who is but a peg higher than flask , happens to have but a small appetite , and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast , then flask must bestir himself , he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day ; for it is against holy usage for stubb to precede flask to the deck . therefore it was that flask once admitted in private , that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer , from that moment he had never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry , more or less . for what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger , as keep it immortal in him . peace and satisfaction , thought flask , have for ever departed from my stomach . i am an officer ; but , how i wish i could fish a bit of old-fashioned beef in the forecastle , as i used to when i was before the mast . there ’ s the fruits of promotion now ; there ’ s the vanity of glory : there ’ s the insanity of life ! besides , if it were so that any mere sailor of the pequod had a grudge against flask in flask ’ s official capacity , all that sailor had to do , in order to obtain ample vengeance , was to go aft at dinner-time , and get a peep at flask through the cabin sky-light , sitting silly and dumfoundered before awful ahab .
melville	moby	about midnight that steak was cut and cooked ; and lighted by two lanterns of sperm oil , stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper at the capstan-head , as if that capstan were a sideboard . nor was stubb the only banqueter on whale ’ s flesh that night . mingling their mumblings with his own mastications , thousands on thousands of sharks , swarming round the dead leviathan , smackingly feasted on its fatness . the few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp slapping of their tails against the hull , within a few inches of the sleepers ’ hearts . peering over the side you could just see them ( as before you heard them ) wallowing in the sullen , black waters , and turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head . this particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous . how at such an apparently unassailable surface , they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls , remains a part of the universal problem of all things . the mark they thus leave on the whale , may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw .
melville	moby	according to a careful calculation i have made , and which i partly base upon captain scoresby ’ s estimate , of seventy tons for the largest sized greenland whale of sixty feet in length ; according to my careful calculation , i say , a sperm whale of the largest magnitude , between eighty-five and ninety feet in length , and something less than forty feet in its fullest circumference , such a whale will weigh at least ninety tons ; so that , reckoning thirteen men to a ton , he would considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one thousand one hundred inhabitants .
melville	moby	chapter 48 . the first lowering . the phantoms , for so they then seemed , were flitting on the other side of the deck , and , with a noiseless celerity , were casting loose the tackles and bands of the boat which swung there . this boat had always been deemed one of the spare boats , though technically called the captain ’ s , on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter . the figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart , with one white tooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips . a rumpled chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him , with wide black trowsers of the same dark stuff . but strangely crowning this ebonness was a glistening white plaited turban , the living hair braided and coiled round and round upon his head . less swart in aspect , the companions of this figure were of that vivid , tiger-yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the manillas ; —a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty , and by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents on the water of the devil , their lord , whose counting-room they suppose to be elsewhere .
melville	moby	but was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that short distance of nineveh ? yes . he might have carried him round by the way of the cape of good hope . but not to speak of the passage through the whole length of the mediterranean , and another passage up the persian gulf and red sea , such a supposition would involve the complete circumnavigation of all africa in three days , not to speak of the tigris waters , near the site of nineveh , being too shallow for any whale to swim in . besides , this idea of jonah ’ s weathering the cape of good hope at so early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery of that great headland from bartholomew diaz , its reputed discoverer , and so make modern history a liar .
melville	moby	“ ha ! ha ! ” cried daggoo , all at once , from his now quiet , swinging perch overhead ; and looking further off from the side , we saw an arm thrust upright from the blue waves ; a sight strange to see , as an arm thrust forth from the grass over a grave .
melville	moby	“ captain ahab , ” said the reddening mate , moving further into the cabin , with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward manifestation of itself , but within also seemed more than half distrustful of itself ; “ a better man than i might well pass over in thee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man ; aye , and in a happier , captain ahab . ”
melville	moby	long maintaining an enchanted silence , ahab stood apart ; and every time the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit , he turned to eye the bright sun ’ s rays produced ahead ; and when she profoundly settled by the stern , he turned behind , and saw the sun ’ s rearward place , and how the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating wake .
melville	moby	and since in this famous fishery , each mate or headsman , like a gothic knight of old , is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or harpooneer , who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance , when the former one has been badly twisted , or elbowed in the assault ; and moreover , as there generally subsists between the two , a close intimacy and friendliness ; it is therefore but meet , that in this place we set down who the pequod ’ s harpooneers were , and to what headsman each of them belonged .
melville	moby	“ i have it , i have it , ” cried stubb , with delight , striking something in the subterranean regions , “ a purse ! a purse ! ” dropping his spade , he thrust both hands in , and drew out handfuls of something that looked like ripe windsor soap , or rich mottled old cheese ; very unctuous and savory withal . you might easily dent it with your thumb ; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour . and this , good friends , is ambergris , worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist . some six handfuls were obtained ; but more was unavoidably lost in the sea , and still more , perhaps , might have been secured were it not for impatient ahab ’ s loud command to stubb to desist , and come on board , else the ship would bid them good bye .
melville	moby	chapter 89 . fast-fish and loose-fish . the allusion to the waif and waif-poles in the last chapter but one , necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale fishery , of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge .

melville	moby	first : though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general perils of the grand fishery , yet they have nothing like a fixed , vivid conception of those perils , and the frequency with which they recur . one reason perhaps is , that not one in fifty of the actual disasters and deaths by casualties in the fishery , ever finds a public record at home , however transient and immediately forgotten that record . do you suppose that that poor fellow there , who this moment perhaps caught by the whale-line off the coast of new guinea , is being carried down to the bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan—do you suppose that that poor fellow ’ s name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read to-morrow at your breakfast ? no : because the mails are very irregular between here and new guinea . in fact , did you ever hear what might be called regular news direct or indirect from new guinea ? yet i tell you that upon one particular voyage which i made to the pacific , among many others we spoke thirty different ships , every one of which had had a death by a whale , some of them more than one , and three that had each lost a boat ’ s crew . for god ’ s sake , be economical with your lamps and candles ! not a gallon you burn , but at least one drop of man ’ s blood was spilled for it .
melville	moby	chapter 69 . the funeral . chapter 70 . the sphynx . chapter 71 . the jeroboam ’ s story . chapter 72 . the monkey-rope . chapter 73 . stubb and flask kill a right whale ; and then have a talk over him .
melville	moby	“ i don ’ t think it so strange , after all , on that account , ” said flask . “ if his leg were off at the hip , now , it would be a different thing . that would disable him ; but he has one knee , and good part of the other left , you know . ”
melville	moby	“ ‘ sink the ship ? ’ cried steelkilt . ‘ aye , let her sink . not a man of us turns to , unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us . what say ye , men ? ’ turning to his comrades . a fierce cheer was their response .
melville	moby	“ that ’ s precisely it , ” said the landlord , “ and i told him he couldn ’ t sell it here , the market ’ s overstocked. ” “ with what ? ” shouted i . “ with heads to be sure ; ain ’ t there too many heads in the world ? ”
melville	moby	“ the corpusants have mercy on us all , ” cried stubb , again . at the base of the mainmast , full beneath the doubloon and the flame , the parsee was kneeling in ahab ’ s front , but with his head bowed away from him ; while near by , from the arched and overhanging rigging , where they had just been engaged securing a spar , a number of the seamen , arrested by the glare , now cohered together , and hung pendulous , like a knot of numbed wasps from a drooping , orchard twig . in various enchanted attitudes , like the standing , or stepping , or running skeletons in herculaneum , others remained rooted to the deck ; but all their eyes upcast .
melville	moby	the ribs were hung with trophies ; the vertebræ were carved with arsacidean annals , in strange hieroglyphics ; in the skull , the priests kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame , so that the mystic head again sent forth its vapory spout ; while , suspended from a bough , the terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees , like the hair-hung sword that so affrighted damocles .
melville	moby	“ it is impossible to meet a whale-ship on the ocean without being struck by her near appearance . the vessel under short sail , with look-outs at the mast-heads , eagerly scanning the wide expanse around them , has a totally different air from those engaged in regular voyage. ” —_currents and whaling . u.s. ex . ex_ .
melville	moby	secondly : it is well known in the sperm whale fishery , however ignorant the world ashore may be of it , that there have been several memorable historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at distant times and places popularly cognisable . why such a whale became thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales ; for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be , they soon put an end to his peculiarities by killing him , and boiling him down into a peculiarly valuable oil . no : the reason was this : that from the fatal experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about such a whale as there did about rinaldo rinaldini , insomuch that most fishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea , without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance . like some poor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible great man , they make distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street , lest if they pursued the acquaintance further , they might receive a summary thump for their presumption .
melville	moby	chapter 132 . the symphony . it was a clear steel-blue day . the firmaments of air and sea were hardly separable in that all-pervading azure ; only , the pensive air was transparently pure and soft , with a woman ’ s look , and the robust and man-like sea heaved with long , strong , lingering swells , as samson ’ s chest in his sleep .
melville	moby	* quoin is not a euclidean term . it belongs to the pure nautical mathematics . i know not that it has been defined before . a quoin is a solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the steep inclination of one side , instead of the mutual tapering of both sides .
melville	moby	“ now , mr. starbuck , are you sure everything is right ? captain ahab is all ready—just spoke to him—nothing more to be got from shore , eh ? well , call all hands , then . muster ’ em aft here—blast ’ em ! ”
melville	moby	chapter 73 . stubb and flask kill a right whale ; and then have a talk over him . it must be borne in mind that all this time we have a sperm whale ’ s prodigious head hanging to the pequod ’ s side . but we must let it continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it . for the present other matters press , and the best we can do now for the head , is to pray heaven the tackles may hold .
melville	moby	now , one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic hours , is his wonderful patience of industry . an ancient hawaiian war-club or spear-paddle , in its full multiplicity and elaboration of carving , is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a latin lexicon . for , with but a bit of broken sea-shell or a shark ’ s tooth , that miraculous intricacy of wooden net-work has been achieved ; and it has cost steady years of steady application .
melville	moby	“ his son ! ” cried stubb , “ oh , it ’ s his son he ’ s lost ! i take back the coat and watch—what says ahab ? we must save that boy. ” “ he ’ s drowned with the rest on ’ em , last night , ” said the old manx sailor standing behind them ; “ i heard ; all of ye heard their spirits . ”
melville	moby	i have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris , certain hard , round , bony plates , which at first stubb thought might be sailors ’ trowsers buttons ; but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner .
melville	moby	to me this vast ivory-ribbed chest , with the long , unrelieved spine , extending far away from it in a straight line , not a little resembled the hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks , when only some twenty of her naked bow-ribs are inserted , and the keel is otherwise , for the time , but a long , disconnected timber .
melville	moby	chapter 122 . midnight aloft.—thunder and lightning . _the main-top-sail yard_.—_tashtego passing new lashings around it_ . “ um , um , um . stop that thunder ! plenty too much thunder up here . what ’ s the use of thunder ? um , um , um . we don ’ t want thunder ; we want rum ; give us a glass of rum . um , um , um ! ”
melville	moby	assuredly , we must conclude so , if we are to credit the accounts of such gentlemen as pliny , and the ancient naturalists generally . for pliny tells us of whales that embraced acres of living bulk , and aldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in length—rope walks and thames tunnels of whales ! and even in the days of banks and solander , cooke ’ s naturalists , we find a danish member of the academy of sciences setting down certain iceland whales ( reydan-siskur , or wrinkled bellies ) at one hundred and twenty yards ; that is , three hundred and sixty feet . and lacépède , the french naturalist , in his elaborate history of whales , in the very beginning of his work ( page 3 ) , sets down the right whale at one hundred metres , three hundred and twenty-eight feet . and this work was published so late as a.d. 1825 .
melville	moby	one after another they peered in , for nothing but their own eyes could persuade such ignorance as theirs , and one after another they slunk away . in his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph , you then saw ahab in all his fatal pride .
melville	moby	“ grub , ho ! ” now cried the landlord , flinging open a door , and in we went to breakfast . they say that men who have seen the world , thereby become quite at ease in manner , quite self-possessed in company . not always , though : ledyard , the great new england traveller , and mungo park , the scotch one ; of all men , they possessed the least assurance in the parlor . but perhaps the mere crossing of siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as ledyard did , or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach , in the negro heart of africa , which was the sum of poor mungo ’ s performances—this kind of travel , i say , may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social polish . still , for the most part , that sort of thing is to be had anywhere .
melville	moby	so that there are instances among them of men , who , named with scripture names—a singularly common fashion on the island—and in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the quaker idiom ; still , from the audacious , daring , and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives , strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities , a thousand bold dashes of character , not unworthy a scandinavian sea-king , or a poetical pagan roman . and when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force , with a globular brain and a ponderous heart ; who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters , and beneath constellations never seen here at the north , been led to think untraditionally and independently ; receiving all nature ’ s sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast , and thereby chiefly , but with some help from accidental advantages , to learn a bold and nervous lofty language—that man makes one in a whole nation ’ s census—a mighty pageant creature , formed for noble tragedies . nor will it at all detract from him , dramatically regarded , if either by birth or other circumstances , he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature . for all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness . be sure of this , o young ambition , all mortal greatness is but disease . but , as yet we have not to do with such an one , but with quite another ; and still a man , who , if indeed peculiar , it only results again from another phase of the quaker , modified by individual circumstances .
melville	moby	“ no more , queequeg , ” said i , shuddering ; “ that will do ; ” for i knew the inferences without his further hinting them . i had seen a sailor who had visited that very island , and he told me that it was the custom , when a great battle had been gained there , to barbecue all the slain in the yard or garden of the victor ; and then , one by one , they were placed in great wooden trenchers , and garnished round like a pilau , with breadfruit and cocoanuts ; and with some parsley in their mouths , were sent round with the victor ’ s compliments to all his friends , just as though these presents were so many christmas turkeys .
melville	moby	meantime , now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of ahab ; and ahab still stood like an anvil , receiving every shock , but without the least quivering of his own .
melville	moby	judge , then , to what pitches of inflamed , distracted fury the minds of his more desperate hunters were impelled , when amid the chips of chewed boats , and the sinking limbs of torn comrades , they swam out of the white curds of the whale ’ s direful wrath into the serene , exasperating sunlight , that smiled on , as if at a birth or a bridal .
melville	moby	“ i will have the first sight of the whale myself , ” —he said . “ aye ! ahab must have the doubloon ! ” and with his own hands he rigged a nest of basketed bowlines ; and sending a hand aloft , with a single sheaved block , to secure to the main-mast head , he received the two ends of the downward-reeved rope ; and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for the other end , in order to fasten it at the rail . this done , with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin , he looked round upon his crew , sweeping from one to the other ; pausing his glance long upon daggoo , queequeg , tashtego ; but shunning fedallah ; and then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate , said , — “ take the rope , sir—i give it into thy hands , starbuck. ” then arranging his person in the basket , he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch , starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last ; and afterwards stood near it . and thus , with one hand clinging round the royal mast , ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles , —ahead , astern , this side , and that , —within the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height .
melville	moby	chapter 20 . all astir . a day or two passed , and there was great activity aboard the pequod . not only were the old sails being mended , but new sails were coming on board , and bolts of canvas , and coils of rigging ; in short , everything betokened that the ship ’ s preparations were hurrying to a close . captain peleg seldom or never went ashore , but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp look-out upon the hands : bildad did all the purchasing and providing at the stores ; and the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were working till long after night-fall .
melville	moby	as he stood hovering over you half suspended in air , so wildly and eagerly peering towards the horizon , you would have thought him some prophet or seer beholding the shadows of fate , and by those wild cries announcing their coming .
melville	moby	“ aye , aye ! ” shouted the harpooneers and seamen , running closer to the excited old man : “ a sharp eye for the white whale ; a sharp lance for moby dick ! ” “ god bless ye , ” he seemed to half sob and half shout . “ god bless ye , men . steward ! go draw the great measure of grog . but what ’ s this long face about , mr. starbuck ; wilt thou not chase the white whale ? art not game for moby dick ? ”
melville	moby	nevertheless , the boats pursued , and stubb ’ s was foremost . by great exertion , tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron ; but the stricken whale , without at all sounding , still continued his horizontal flight , with added fleetness . such unintermitted strainings upon the planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it . it became imperative to lance the flying whale , or be content to lose him . but to haul the boat up to his flank was impossible , he swam so fast and furious . what then remained ?
melville	moby	“ so it is , so it is ; if we get it. ” “ i was speaking of the oil in the hold , sir. ” “ and i was not speaking or thinking of that at all . begone ! let it leak ! i ’ m all aleak myself . aye ! leaks in leaks ! not only full of leaky casks , but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship ; and that ’ s a far worse plight than the pequod ’ s , man . yet i don ’ t stop to plug my leak ; for who can find it in the deep-loaded hull ; or how hope to plug it , even if found , in this life ’ s howling gale ? starbuck ! i ’ ll not have the burtons hoisted . ”
melville	moby	i assert , then , that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly lurks the secret of the spell ; a truth the more evinced in this , that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses ; and these i have frequently seen , but never with such emotions as when i beheld the antarctic fowl .
melville	moby	nor do heroes , saints , demigods , and prophets alone comprise the whole roll of our order . our grand master is still to be named ; for like royal kings of old times , we find the head waters of our fraternity in nothing short of the great gods themselves . that wondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the shaster , which gives us the dread vishnoo , one of the three persons in the godhead of the hindoos ; gives us this divine vishnoo himself for our lord ; —vishnoo , who , by the first of his ten earthly incarnations , has for ever set apart and sanctified the whale . when brahma , or the god of gods , saith the shaster , resolved to recreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions , he gave birth to vishnoo , to preside over the work ; but the vedas , or mystical books , whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to vishnoo before beginning the creation , and which therefore must have contained something in the shape of practical hints to young architects , these vedas were lying at the bottom of the waters ; so vishnoo became incarnate in a whale , and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths , rescued the sacred volumes . was not this vishnoo a whaleman , then ? even as a man who rides a horse is called a horseman ?
melville	moby	the more i pondered over this harpooneer , the more i abominated the thought of sleeping with him . it was fair to presume that being a harpooneer , his linen or woollen , as the case might be , would not be of the tidiest , certainly none of the finest . i began to twitch all over . besides , it was getting late , and my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards . suppose now , he should tumble in upon me at midnight—how could i tell from what vile hole he had been coming ?
melville	moby	true enough , but then whalemen themselves are poor devils ; they have no good blood in their veins . _no good blood in their veins ? _ they have something better than royal blood there . the grandmother of benjamin franklin was mary morrel ; afterwards , by marriage , mary folger , one of the old settlers of nantucket , and the ancestress to a long line of folgers and harpooneers—all kith and kin to noble benjamin—this day darting the barbed iron from one side of the world to the other .
melville	moby	“ ah ! poor fellow ! he ’ ll have to die now , ” ejaculated the long island sailor . going to his vice-bench , the carpenter for convenience sake and general reference , now transferringly measured on it the exact length the coffin was to be , and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notches at its extremities . this done , he marshalled the planks and his tools , and to work .
melville	moby	“ no , no , no ! ye have not a whole body , sir ; do ye but use poor me for your one lost leg ; only tread upon me , sir ; i ask no more , so i remain a part of ye . ”
melville	moby	wooden whales , or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of the noble south sea war-wood , are frequently met with in the forecastles of american whalers . some of them are done with much accuracy .
melville	moby	chapter 58 . brit . steering north-eastward from the crozetts , we fell in with vast meadows of brit , the minute , yellow substance , upon which the right whale largely feeds . for leagues and leagues it undulated round us , so that we seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden wheat .
melville	moby	perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative enactment , was that of holland . it was decreed by the states-general in a.d. 1695 . but though no other nation has ever had any written whaling law , yet the american fishermen have been their own legislators and lawyers in this matter . they have provided a system which for terse comprehensiveness surpasses justinian ’ s pandects and the by-laws of the chinese society for the suppression of meddling with other people ’ s business . yes ; these laws might be engraven on a queen anne ’ s farthing , or the barb of a harpoon , and worn round the neck , so small are they .
melville	moby	i was struck with the singular posture he maintained . upon each side of the pequod ’ s quarter deck , and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds , there was an auger hole , bored about half an inch or so , into the plank . his bone leg steadied in that hole ; one arm elevated , and holding by a shroud ; captain ahab stood erect , looking straight out beyond the ship ’ s ever-pitching prow . there was an infinity of firmest fortitude , a determinate , unsurrenderable wilfulness , in the fixed and fearless , forward dedication of that glance . not a word he spoke ; nor did his officers say aught to him ; though by all their minutest gestures and expressions , they plainly showed the uneasy , if not painful , consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye . and not only that , but moody stricken ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face ; in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe .
melville	moby	“ attend now , my braves . i have mustered ye all round this capstan ; and ye mates , flank me with your lances ; and ye harpooneers , stand there with your irons ; and ye , stout mariners , ring me in , that i may in some sort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me . o men , you will yet see that—ha ! boy , come back ? bad pennies come not sooner . hand it me . why , now , this pewter had run brimming again , wer ’ t not thou st. vitus ’ imp—away , thou ague !

melville	moby	“ at sunrise the captain went forward , and knocking on the deck , summoned the prisoners to work ; but with a yell they refused . water was then lowered down to them , and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed after it ; when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it , the captain returned to the quarter-deck . twice every day for three days this was repeated ; but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling , and then a scuffling was heard , as the customary summons was delivered ; and suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle , saying they were ready to turn to . the fetid closeness of the air , and a famishing diet , united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution , had constrained them to surrender at discretion . emboldened by this , the captain reiterated his demand to the rest , but steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged . on the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain them . only three were left .
melville	moby	chapter 126 . the life-buoy . steering now south-eastward by ahab ’ s levelled steel , and her progress solely determined by ahab ’ s level log and line ; the pequod held on her path towards the equator . making so long a passage through such unfrequented waters , descrying no ships , and ere long , sideways impelled by unvarying trade winds , over waves monotonously mild ; all these seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous and desperate scene .
melville	moby	as he thundered out this he made a rush at bildad , but with a marvellous oblique , sliding celerity , bildad for that time eluded him . alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible owners of the ship , and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded , i stepped aside from the door to give egress to bildad , who , i made no doubt , was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of peleg . but to my astonishment , he sat down again on the transom very quietly , and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing . he seemed quite used to impenitent peleg and his ways . as for peleg , after letting off his rage as he had , there seemed no more left in him , and he , too , sat down like a lamb , though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated . “ whew ! ” he whistled at last— “ the squall ’ s gone off to leeward , i think . bildad , thou used to be good at sharpening a lance , mend that pen , will ye . my jack-knife here needs the grindstone . that ’ s he ; thank ye , bildad . now then , my young man , ishmael ’ s thy name , didn ’ t ye say ? well then , down ye go here , ishmael , for the three hundredth lay . ”
melville	moby	i thought , sir , that you spoke to carpenter . carpenter ? why that ’ s—but no ; —a very tidy , and , i may say , an extremely gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here , carpenter ; —or would ’ st thou rather work in clay ?
melville	moby	“ didn ’ t say dat t ’ all , ” said fleece , again in the sulks . “ you said up there , didn ’ t you ? and now look yourself , and see where your tongs are pointing . but , perhaps you expect to get into heaven by crawling through the lubber ’ s hole , cook ; but , no , no , cook , you don ’ t get there , except you go the regular way , round by the rigging . it ’ s a ticklish business , but must be done , or else it ’ s no go . but none of us are in heaven yet . drop your tongs , cook , and hear my orders . do ye hear ? hold your hat in one hand , and clap t ’ other a ’ top of your heart , when i ’ m giving my orders , cook . what ! that your heart , there ? —that ’ s your gizzard ! aloft ! aloft ! —that ’ s it—now you have it . hold it there now , and pay attention . ”
melville	moby	nor , perhaps , will it fail to be eventually perceived , that behind those forms and usages , as it were , he sometimes masked himself ; incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than they were legitimately intended to subserve . that certain sultanism of his brain , which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested ; through those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship . for be a man ’ s intellectual superiority what it will , it can never assume the practical , available supremacy over other men , without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments , always , in themselves , more or less paltry and base . this it is , that for ever keeps god ’ s true princes of the empire from the world ’ s hustings ; and leaves the highest honors that this air can give , to those men who become famous more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the divine inert , than through their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass . such large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme political superstitions invest them , that in some royal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency . but when , as in the case of nicholas the czar , the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an imperial brain ; then , the plebeian herds crouch abased before the tremendous centralization . nor , will the tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing , ever forget a hint , incidentally so important in his art , as the one now alluded to .
melville	moby	* the ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-head , still used by whalemen in hunting the famous gallipagos terrapin . for my humor ’ s sake , i shall preserve the style in which i once narrated it at lima , to a lounging circle of my spanish friends , one saint ’ s eve , smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the golden inn . of those fine cavaliers , the young dons , pedro and sebastian , were on the closer terms with me ; and hence the interluding questions they occasionally put , and which are duly answered at the time .
melville	moby	but as perhaps fifty of these whale-bone whales are harpooned for one cachalot , some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions . but though for some time past a number of these whales , not less than 13,000 , have been annually slain on the nor ’ west coast by the americans alone ; yet there are considerations which render even this circumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument in this matter .
melville	moby	“ what now ? ” said the guernsey-man , when the captain had returned to them . “ why , let me see ; yes , you may as well tell him now that—that—in fact , tell him i ’ ve diddled him , and ( aside to himself ) perhaps somebody else . ”
melville	moby	“ the rods ! the rods ! ” cried starbuck to the crew , suddenly admonished to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting flambeaux , to light ahab to his post . “ are they overboard ? drop them over , fore and aft . quick ! ”
melville	moby	it was a sight to see queequeg seated over against tashtego , opposing his filed teeth to the indian ’ s : crosswise to them , daggoo seated on the floor , for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the low carlines ; at every motion of his colossal limbs , making the low cabin framework to shake , as when an african elephant goes passenger in a ship . but for all this , the great negro was wonderfully abstemious , not to say dainty . it seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad , baronial , and superb a person . but , doubtless , this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air ; and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds . not by beef or by bread , are giants made or nourished . but queequeg , he had a mortal , barbaric smack of the lip in eating—an ugly sound enough—so much so , that the trembling dough-boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms . and when he would hear tashtego singing out for him to produce himself , that his bones might be picked , the simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round him in the pantry , by his sudden fits of the palsy . nor did the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets , for their lances and other weapons ; and with which whetstones , at dinner , they would ostentatiously sharpen their knives ; that grating sound did not at all tend to tranquillize poor dough-boy . how could he forget that in his island days , queequeg , for one , must certainly have been guilty of some murderous , convivial indiscretions . alas ! dough-boy ! hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals . not a napkin should he carry on his arm , but a buckler . in good time , though , to his great delight , the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart ; to his credulous , fable-mongering ears , all their martial bones jingling in them at every step , like moorish scimetars in scabbards .
melville	moby	“ he would have shot me once , ” he murmured , “ yes , there ’ s the very musket that he pointed at me ; —that one with the studded stock ; let me touch it—lift it . strange , that i , who have handled so many deadly lances , strange , that i should shake so now . loaded ? i must see . aye , aye ; and powder in the pan ; —that ’ s not good . best spill it ? —wait . i ’ ll cure myself of this . i ’ ll hold the musket boldly while i think.—i come to report a fair wind to him . but how fair ? fair for death and doom , —_that ’ s_ fair for moby dick . it ’ s a fair wind that ’ s only fair for that accursed fish.—the very tube he pointed at me ! —the very one ; _this_ one—i hold it here ; he would have killed me with the very thing i handle now.—aye and he would fain kill all his crew . does he not say he will not strike his spars to any gale ? has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant ? and in these same perilous seas , gropes he not his way by mere dead reckoning of the error-abounding log ? and in this very typhoon , did he not swear that he would have no lightning-rods ? but shall this crazed old man be tamely suffered to drag a whole ship ’ s company down to doom with him ? —yes , it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and more , if this ship come to any deadly harm ; and come to deadly harm , my soul swears this ship will , if ahab have his way . if , then , he were this instant—put aside , that crime would not be his . ha ! is he muttering in his sleep ? yes , just there , —in there , he ’ s sleeping . sleeping ? aye , but still alive , and soon awake again . i can ’ t withstand thee , then , old man . not reasoning ; not remonstrance ; not entreaty wilt thou hearken to ; all this thou scornest . flat obedience to thy own flat commands , this is all thou breathest . aye , and say ’ st the men have vow ’ d thy vow ; say ’ st all of us are ahabs . great god forbid ! —but is there no other way ? no lawful way ? —make him a prisoner to be taken home ? what ! hope to wrest this old man ’ s living power from his own living hands ? only a fool would try it . say he were pinioned even ; knotted all over with ropes and hawsers ; chained down to ring-bolts on this cabin floor ; he would be more hideous than a caged tiger , then . i could not endure the sight ; could not possibly fly his howlings ; all comfort , sleep itself , inestimable reason would leave me on the long intolerable voyage . what , then , remains ? the land is hundreds of leagues away , and locked japan the nearest . i stand alone here upon an open sea , with two oceans and a whole continent between me and law.—aye , aye , ’ tis so.—is heaven a murderer when its lightning strikes a would-be murderer in his bed , tindering sheets and skin together ? —and would i be a murderer , then , if ” —and slowly , stealthily , and half sideways looking , he placed the loaded musket ’ s end against the door .
melville	moby	fifth : as in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes lie considerably below the level of his back , they are then completely out of sight beneath the surface ; but when he is about to plunge into the deeps , his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are tossed erect in the air , and so remain vibrating a moment , till they downwards shoot out of view . excepting the sublime _breach_—somewhere else to be described—this peaking of the whale ’ s flukes is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature . out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the highest heaven . so in dreams , have i seen majestic satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from the flame baltic of hell . but in gazing at such scenes , it is all in all what mood you are in ; if in the dantean , the devils will occur to you ; if in that of isaiah , the archangels . standing at the mast-head of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea , i once saw a large herd of whales in the east , all heading towards the sun , and for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes . as it seemed to me at the time , such a grand embodiment of adoration of the gods was never beheld , even in persia , the home of the fire worshippers . as ptolemy philopater testified of the african elephant , i then testified of the whale , pronouncing him the most devout of all beings . for according to king juba , the military elephants of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the profoundest silence .
melville	moby	“ landlord ! i ’ ve changed my mind about that harpooneer.—i shan ’ t sleep with him . i ’ ll try the bench here. ” “ just as you please ; i ’ m sorry i can ’ t spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress , and it ’ s a plaguy rough board here ” —feeling of the knots and notches . “ but wait a bit , skrimshander ; i ’ ve got a carpenter ’ s plane there in the bar—wait , i say , and i ’ ll make ye snug enough. ” so saying he procured the plane ; and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting the bench , vigorously set to planing away at my bed , the while grinning like an ape . the shavings flew right and left ; till at last the plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot . the landlord was near spraining his wrist , and i told him for heaven ’ s sake to quit—the bed was soft enough to suit me , and i did not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a pine plank . so gathering up the shavings with another grin , and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room , he went about his business , and left me in a brown study .
melville	moby	it was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and moonlight night , when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver ; and , by their soft , suffusing seethings , made what seemed a silvery silence , not a solitude ; on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow . lit up by the moon , it looked celestial ; seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from the sea . fedallah first descried this jet . for of these moonlight nights , it was his wont to mount to the main-mast head , and stand a look-out there , with the same precision as if it had been day . and yet , though herds of whales were seen by night , not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for them . you may think with what emotions , then , the seamen beheld this old oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours ; his turban and the moon , companions in one sky . but when , after spending his uniform interval there for several successive nights without uttering a single sound ; when , after all this silence , his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery , moon-lit jet , every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit had lighted in the rigging , and hailed the mortal crew . “ there she blows ! ” had the trump of judgment blown , they could not have quivered more ; yet still they felt no terror ; rather pleasure . for though it was a most unwonted hour , yet so impressive was the cry , and so deliriously exciting , that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a lowering .
melville	moby	“ much this way had it been with the town-ho ; so when her leak was found gaining once more , there was in truth some small concern manifested by several of her company ; especially by radney the mate . he commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted , sheeted home anew , and every way expanded to the breeze . now this radney , i suppose , was as little of a coward , and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless , unthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently imagine , gentlemen . therefore when he betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship , some of the seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner in her . so when they were working that evening at the pumps , there was on this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them , as they stood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear water ; clear as any mountain spring , gentlemen—that bubbling from the pumps ran across the deck , and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee scupper-holes .
melville	moby	nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity of the whale , in his own osseous post-diluvian reality , as set down by the venerable john leo , the old barbary traveller .
melville	moby	i do not know where i can find a better place than just here , to make mention of one or two other things , which to me seem important , as in printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the whole story of the white whale , more especially the catastrophe . for this is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires full as much bolstering as error . so ignorant are most landsmen of some of the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world , that without some hints touching the plain facts , historical and otherwise , of the fishery , they might scout at moby dick as a monstrous fable , or still worse and more detestable , a hideous and intolerable allegory .
melville	moby	his motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion . in most land animals there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins , whereby when wounded , the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in certain directions . not so with the whale ; one of whose peculiarities it is to have an entire non-valvular structure of the blood-vessels , so that when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon , a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial system ; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance below the surface , his life may be said to pour from him in incessant streams . yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him , and so distant and numerous its interior fountains , that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period ; even as in a drought a river will flow , whose source is in the well-springs of far-off and undiscernible hills . even now , when the boats pulled upon this whale , and perilously drew over his swaying flukes , and the lances were darted into him , they were followed by steady jets from the new made wound , which kept continually playing , while the natural spout-hole in his head was only at intervals , however rapid , sending its affrighted moisture into the air . from this last vent no blood yet came , because no vital part of him had thus far been struck . his life , as they significantly call it , was untouched .
melville	moby	“ find who ? ” “ morning to ye ! morning to ye ! ” he rejoined , again moving off . “ oh ! i was going to warn ye against—but never mind , never mind—it ’ s all one , all in the family too ; —sharp frost this morning , ain ’ t it ? good-bye to ye . shan ’ t see ye again very soon , i guess ; unless it ’ s before the grand jury. ” and with these cracked words he finally departed , leaving me , for the moment , in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence .
melville	moby	book ii . ( _octavo_ ) , chapter i . ( _grampus_ ) .—though this fish , whose loud sonorous breathing , or rather blowing , has furnished a proverb to landsmen , is so well known a denizen of the deep , yet is he not popularly classed among whales . but possessing all the grand distinctive features of the leviathan , most naturalists have recognised him for one . he is of moderate octavo size , varying from fifteen to twenty-five feet in length , and of corresponding dimensions round the waist . he swims in herds ; he is never regularly hunted , though his oil is considerable in quantity , and pretty good for light . by some fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale .
melville	moby	but far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface , another and still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side . for , suspended in those watery vaults , floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the whales , and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become mothers . the lake , as i have hinted , was to a considerable depth exceedingly transparent ; and as human infants while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast , as if leading two different lives at the time ; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment , be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence ; —even so did the young of these whales seem looking up towards us , but not at us , as if we were but a bit of gulfweed in their new-born sight . floating on their sides , the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us . one of these little infants , that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old , might have measured some fourteen feet in length , and some six feet in girth . he was a little frisky ; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal reticule ; where , tail to head , and all ready for the final spring , the unborn whale lies bent like a tartar ’ s bow . the delicate side-fins , and the palms of his flukes , still freshly retained the plaited crumpled appearance of a baby ’ s ears newly arrived from foreign parts .
melville	moby	“ who ’ s there ? ” “ old thunder ! ” said ahab , groping his way along the bulwarks to his pivot-hole ; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed lances of fire . now , as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off the perilous fluid into the soil ; so the kindred rod which at sea some ships carry to each mast , is intended to conduct it into the water . but as this conductor must descend to considerable depth , that its end may avoid all contact with the hull ; and as moreover , if kept constantly towing there , it would be liable to many mishaps , besides interfering not a little with some of the rigging , and more or less impeding the vessel ’ s way in the water ; because of all this , the lower parts of a ship ’ s lightning-rods are not always overboard ; but are generally made in long slender links , so as to be the more readily hauled up into the chains outside , or thrown down into the sea , as occasion may require .
melville	moby	“ ‘ very good . let me board you a moment—i come in peace. ’ with that he leaped from the canoe , swam to the boat ; and climbing the gunwale , stood face to face with the captain .
melville	moby	“ blast the boat ! let it go ! ” cried stubb at this instant , as a swashing sea heaved up under his own little craft , so that its gunwale violently jammed his hand , as he was passing a lashing . “ blast it ! ” —but slipping backward on the deck , his uplifted eyes caught the flames ; and immediately shifting his tone he cried— “ the corpusants have mercy on us all ! ”
melville	moby	um-m . so he must . i do deem it now a most meaning thing , that that old greek , prometheus , who made men , they say , should have been a blacksmith , and animated them with fire ; for what ’ s made in fire must properly belong to fire ; and so hell ’ s probable . how the soot flies ! this must be the remainder the greek made the africans of . carpenter , when he ’ s through with that buckle , tell him to forge a pair of steel shoulder-blades ; there ’ s a pedlar aboard with a crushing pack .
melville	moby	* that part of the sea known among whalemen as the “ brazil banks ” does not bear that name as the banks of newfoundland do , because of there being shallows and soundings there , but because of this remarkable meadow-like appearance , caused by the vast drifts of brit continually floating in those latitudes , where the right whale is often chased .
melville	moby	i asked him what might be his immediate purpose , touching his future movements . he answered , to go to sea again , in his old vocation . upon this , i told him that whaling was my own design , and informed him of my intention to sail out of nantucket , as being the most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from . he at once resolved to accompany me to that island , ship aboard the same vessel , get into the same watch , the same boat , the same mess with me , in short to share my every hap ; with both my hands in his , boldly dip into the potluck of both worlds . to all this i joyously assented ; for besides the affection i now felt for queequeg , he was an experienced harpooneer , and as such , could not fail to be of great usefulness to one , who , like me , was wholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling , though well acquainted with the sea , as known to merchant seamen .
melville	moby	chapter 79 . the prairie . to scan the lines of his face , or feel the bumps on the head of this leviathan ; this is a thing which no physiognomist or phrenologist has as yet undertaken . such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as for lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the rock of gibraltar , or for gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the dome of the pantheon . still , in that famous work of his , lavater not only treats of the various faces of men , but also attentively studies the faces of horses , birds , serpents , and fish ; and dwells in detail upon the modifications of expression discernible therein . nor have gall and his disciple spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the phrenological characteristics of other beings than man . therefore , though i am but ill qualified for a pioneer , in the application of these two semi-sciences to the whale , i will do my endeavor . i try all things ; i achieve what i can .
melville	moby	stubb saw him pause ; and perhaps intending , not vainly , though , to evince his own unabated fortitude , and thus keep up a valiant place in his captain ’ s mind , he advanced , and eyeing the wreck exclaimed— “ the thistle the ass refused ; it pricked his mouth too keenly , sir ; ha ! ha ! ”
melville	moby	chapter 34 . the cabin-table . it is noon ; and dough-boy , the steward , thrusting his pale loaf-of-bread face from the cabin-scuttle , announces dinner to his lord and master ; who , sitting in the lee quarter-boat , has just been taking an observation of the sun ; and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth , medallion-shaped tablet , reserved for that daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg . from his complete inattention to the tidings , you would think that moody ahab had not heard his menial . but presently , catching hold of the mizen shrouds , he swings himself to the deck , and in an even , unexhilarated voice , saying , “ dinner , mr. starbuck , ” disappears into the cabin .

melville	moby	as if too long lurking behind the headlands , till the pequod should fairly have entered the straits , these rascally asiatics were now in hot pursuit , to make up for their over-cautious delay . but when the swift pequod , with a fresh leading wind , was herself in hot chase ; how very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on to her own chosen pursuit , —mere riding-whips and rowels to her , that they were . as with glass under arm , ahab to-and-fro paced the deck ; in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased , and in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing _him_ ; some such fancy as the above seemed his . and when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery defile in which the ship was then sailing , and bethought him that through that gate lay the route to his vengeance , and beheld , how that through that same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end ; and not only that , but a herd of remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with their curses ; —when all these conceits had passed through his brain , ahab ’ s brow was left gaunt and ribbed , like the black sand beach after some stormy tide has been gnawing it , without being able to drag the firm thing from its place .
melville	moby	and stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew . the frenzies of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up , like old wine worked anew . whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might have felt before ; these were not only now kept out of sight through the growing awe of ahab , but they were broken up , and on all sides routed , as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison . the hand of fate had snatched all their souls ; and by the stirring perils of the previous day ; the rack of the past night ’ s suspense ; the fixed , unfearing , blind , reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging towards its flying mark ; by all these things , their hearts were bowled along . the wind that made great bellies of their sails , and rushed the vessel on by arms invisible as irresistible ; this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race .
melville	moby	“ please , sir , who is the lord warden ? ” “ the duke. ” “ but the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish ? ” “ it is his. ” “ we have been at great trouble , and peril , and some expense , and is all that to go to the duke ’ s benefit ; we getting nothing at all for our pains but our blisters ? ”
melville	moby	he now perceived that the guernsey-man , who had just got into the chains , and was using a cutting-spade , had slung his nose in a sort of bag . “ what ’ s the matter with your nose , there ? ” said stubb . “ broke it ? ”
melville	moby	but ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew , the old man with a rigid laugh exclaimed , “ i have it ! it has happened before . mr. starbuck , last night ’ s thunder turned our compasses—that ’ s all . thou hast before now heard of such a thing , i take it . ”
melville	moby	“ mast-head , there ! look sharp , all of ye ! there are whales hereabouts ! “ if ye see a white one , split your lungs for him ! “ what do you think of that now , flask ? ain ’ t there a small drop of something queer about that , eh ? a white whale—did ye mark that , man ? look ye—there ’ s something special in the wind . stand by for it , flask . ahab has that that ’ s bloody on his mind . but , mum ; he comes this way . ”
melville	moby	but though the other boarders kept coming in by ones , twos , and threes , and going to bed , yet no sign of my harpooneer . “ landlord ! ” said i , “ what sort of a chap is he—does he always keep such late hours ? ” it was now hard upon twelve o ’ clock .
melville	moby	but be all this as it may ; let the unseen , ambiguous synod in the air , or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire , have to do or not with earthly ahab , yet , in this present matter of his leg , he took plain practical procedures ; —he called the carpenter .
melville	moby	chapter 114 . the gilder . penetrating further and further into the heart of the japanese cruising ground , the pequod was soon all astir in the fishery . often , in mild , pleasant weather , for twelve , fifteen , eighteen , and twenty hours on the stretch , they were engaged in the boats , steadily pulling , or sailing , or paddling after the whales , or for an interlude of sixty or seventy minutes calmly awaiting their uprising ; though with but small success for their pains .
melville	moby	it was even so ; in their headlong eagerness , the men had mistaken some other thing for the whale-spout , as the event itself soon proved ; for hardly had ahab reached his perch ; hardly was the rope belayed to its pin on deck , when he struck the key-note to an orchestra , that made the air vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles . the triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard , as—much nearer to the ship than the place of the imaginary jet , less than a mile ahead—moby dick bodily burst into view ! for not by any calm and indolent spoutings ; not by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head , did the white whale now reveal his vicinity ; but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching . rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths , the sperm whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure element of air , and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam , shows his place to the distance of seven miles and more . in those moments , the torn , enraged waves he shakes off , seem his mane ; in some cases , this breaching is his act of defiance .
melville	moby	“ bad news ; she brings bad news , ” muttered the old manxman . but ere her commander , who , with trumpet to mouth , stood up in his boat ; ere he could hopefully hail , ahab ’ s voice was heard .
melville	moby	forced into familiarity , then , with such prodigies as these ; and knowing that after repeated , intrepid assaults , the white whale had escaped alive ; it can not be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still further in their superstitions ; declaring moby dick not only ubiquitous , but immortal ( for immortality is but ubiquity in time ) ; that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks , he would still swim away unharmed ; or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick blood , such a sight would be but a ghastly deception ; for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away , his unsullied jet would once more be seen .
melville	moby	* with reference to the polar bear , it may possibly be urged by him who would fain go still deeper into this matter , that it is not the whiteness , separately regarded , which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that brute ; for , analysed , that heightened hideousness , it might be said , only rises from the circumstance , that the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love ; and hence , by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds , the polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast . but even assuming all this to be true ; yet , were it not for the whiteness , you would not have that intensified terror .
melville	moby	as he was thus walking , uttering no sound , except to hail the men aloft , or to bid them hoist a sail still higher , or to spread one to a still greater breadth—thus to and fro pacing , beneath his slouched hat , at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat , which had been dropped upon the quarter-deck , and lay there reversed ; broken bow to shattered stern . at last he paused before it ; and as in an already over-clouded sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across , so over the old man ’ s face there now stole some such added gloom as this .
melville	moby	and right in among those sharks was queequeg ; who often pushed them aside with his floundering feet . a thing altogether incredible were it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale , the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man .

melville	moby	“ in the little rocky isle of man , sir. ” “ excellent ! thou ’ st hit the world by that. ” “ i know not , sir , but i was born there. ” “ in the isle of man , hey ? well , the other way , it ’ s good . here ’ s a man from man ; a man born in once independent man , and now unmanned of man ; which is sucked in—by what ? up with the reel ! the dead , blind wall butts all inquiring heads at last . up with it ! so . ”
melville	moby	in this one matter , ahab seemed no exception to most american whale captains , who , as a set , rather incline to the opinion that by rights the ship ’ s cabin belongs to them ; and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else is , at any time , permitted there . so that , in real truth , the mates and harpooneers of the pequod might more properly be said to have lived out of the cabin than in it . for when they did enter it , it was something as a street-door enters a house ; turning inwards for a moment , only to be turned out the next ; and , as a permanent thing , residing in the open air . nor did they lose much hereby ; in the cabin was no companionship ; socially , ahab was inaccessible . though nominally included in the census of christendom , he was still an alien to it . he lived in the world , as the last of the grisly bears lived in settled missouri . and as when spring and summer had departed , that wild logan of the woods , burying himself in the hollow of a tree , lived out the winter there , sucking his own paws ; so , in his inclement , howling old age , ahab ’ s soul , shut up in the caved trunk of his body , there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom !
melville	moby	by this time stubb was over the side , and getting into his boat , hailed the guernsey-man to this effect , —that having a long tow-line in his boat , he would do what he could to help them , by pulling out the lighter whale of the two from the ship ’ s side . while the frenchman ’ s boats , then , were engaged in towing the ship one way , stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way , ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long tow-line .
melville	moby	meanwhile , as we thus lay entranced , the occasional sudden frantic spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats , still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host ; or possibly carrying on the war within the first circle , where abundance of room and some convenient retreats were afforded them . but the sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro across the circles , was nothing to what at last met our eyes . it is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful and alert , to seek to hamstring him , as it were , by sundering or maiming his gigantic tail-tendon . it is done by darting a short-handled cutting-spade , to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again . a whale wounded ( as we afterwards learned ) in this part , but not effectually , as it seemed , had broken away from the boat , carrying along with him half of the harpoon line ; and in the extraordinary agony of the wound , he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado arnold , at the battle of saratoga , carrying dismay wherever he went .
melville	moby	chapter 99 . the doubloon . ere now it has been related how ahab was wont to pace his quarter-deck , taking regular turns at either limit , the binnacle and mainmast ; but in the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been added how that sometimes in these walks , when most plunged in his mood , he was wont to pause in turn at each spot , and stand there strangely eyeing the particular object before him . when he halted before the binnacle , with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass , that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of his purpose ; and when resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast , then , as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin there , he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness , only dashed with a certain wild longing , if not hopefulness .
melville	moby	by some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious creature , here spoken of , it is included among the class of cuttle-fish , to which , indeed , in certain external respects it would seem to belong , but only as the anak of the tribe .
melville	moby	nevertheless , ere long , the warm , warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant , holiday weather we came to , seemed gradually to charm him from his mood . for , as when the red-cheeked , dancing girls , april and may , trip home to the wintry , misanthropic woods ; even the barest , ruggedest , most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts , to welcome such glad-hearted visitants ; so ahab did , in the end , a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air . more than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look , which , in any other man , would have soon flowered out in a smile .
melville	moby	and now , while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out , as the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way ; and from his body being submerged beneath the boat , he could not be darted at from the bows , for the bows were almost inside of him , as it were ; and while the other boats involuntarily paused , as before a quick crisis impossible to withstand , then it was that monomaniac ahab , furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe , which placed him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated ; frenzied with all this , he seized the long bone with his naked hands , and wildly strove to wrench it from its gripe . as now he thus vainly strove , the jaw slipped from him ; the frail gunwales bent in , collapsed , and snapped , as both jaws , like an enormous shears , sliding further aft , bit the craft completely in twain , and locked themselves fast again in the sea , midway between the two floating wrecks . these floated aside , the broken ends drooping , the crew at the stern-wreck clinging to the gunwales , and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them across .

melville	moby	now , from the south and west the pequod was drawing nigh to formosa and the bashee isles , between which lies one of the tropical outlets from the china waters into the pacific . and so starbuck found ahab with a general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him ; and another separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the japanese islands—niphon , matsmai , and sikoke . with his snow-white new ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table , and with a long pruning-hook of a jack-knife in his hand , the wondrous old man , with his back to the gangway door , was wrinkling his brow , and tracing his old courses again .
melville	moby	it may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at their last wills and testaments , but there are no people in the world more fond of that diversion . this was the fourth time in my nautical life that i had done the same thing . after the ceremony was concluded upon the present occasion , i felt all the easier ; a stone was rolled away from my heart . besides , all the days i should now live would be as good as the days that lazarus lived after his resurrection ; a supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case might be . i survived myself ; my death and burial were locked up in my chest . i looked round me tranquilly and contentedly , like a quiet ghost with a clean conscience sitting inside the bars of a snug family vault .
melville	moby	ere knocking at his state-room , he involuntarily paused before it a moment . the cabin lamp—taking long swings this way and that—was burning fitfully , and casting fitful shadows upon the old man ’ s bolted door , —a thin one , with fixed blinds inserted , in place of upper panels . the isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain humming silence to reign there , though it was hooped round by all the roar of the elements . the loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed , as they stood upright against the forward bulkhead . starbuck was an honest , upright man ; but out of starbuck ’ s heart , at that instant when he saw the muskets , there strangely evolved an evil thought ; but so blent with its neutral or good accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for itself .
melville	moby	reckoning the largest sized sperm whale ’ s tail to begin at that point of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man , it comprises upon its upper surface alone , an area of at least fifty square feet . the compact round body of its root expands into two broad , firm , flat palms or flukes , gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness . at the crotch or junction , these flukes slightly overlap , then sideways recede from each other like wings , leaving a wide vacancy between . in no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely defined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes . at its utmost expansion in the full grown whale , the tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across .
melville	moby	while this pallidness was burning aloft , few words were heard from the enchanted crew ; who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle , all their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence , like a far away constellation of stars . relieved against the ghostly light , the gigantic jet negro , daggoo , loomed up to thrice his real stature , and seemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come . the parted mouth of tashtego revealed his shark-white teeth , which strangely gleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants ; while lit up by the preternatural light , queequeg ’ s tattooing burned like satanic blue flames on his body .
melville	moby	“ yes , ” said captain bildad in his hollow voice , sticking his head from behind peleg ’ s , out of the wigwam . “ he must show that he ’ s converted . son of darkness , ” he added , turning to queequeg , “ art thou at present in communion with any christian church ? ”
melville	moby	but look at the godly , honest , unostentatious , hospitable , sociable , free-and-easy whaler ! what does the whaler do when she meets another whaler in any sort of decent weather ? she has a “ _gam_ , ” a thing so utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name even ; and if by chance they should hear of it , they only grin at it , and repeat gamesome stuff about “ spouters ” and “ blubber-boilers , ” and such like pretty exclamations . why it is that all merchant-seamen , and also all pirates and man-of-war ’ s men , and slave-ship sailors , cherish such a scornful feeling towards whale-ships ; this is a question it would be hard to answer . because , in the case of pirates , say , i should like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it . it sometimes ends in uncommon elevation , indeed ; but only at the gallows . and besides , when a man is elevated in that odd fashion , he has no proper foundation for his superior altitude . hence , i conclude , that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman , in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on .
melville	moby	in the distance , a great white mass lazily rose , and rising higher and higher , and disentangling itself from the azure , at last gleamed before our prow like a snow-slide , new slid from the hills . thus glistening for a moment , as slowly it subsided , and sank . then once more arose , and silently gleamed . it seemed not a whale ; and yet is this moby dick ? thought daggoo . again the phantom went down , but on re-appearing once more , with a stiletto-like cry that startled every man from his nod , the negro yelled out— “ there ! there again ! there she breaches ! right ahead ! the white whale , the white whale ! ”
melville	moby	and all the time numberless fowls were diving , and ducking , and screaming , and yelling , and fighting around them . stubb was beginning to look disappointed , especially as the horrible nosegay increased , when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague , there stole a faint stream of perfume , which flowed through the tide of bad smells without being absorbed by it , as one river will flow into and then along with another , without at all blending with it for a time .

melville	moby	it will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the duke to the whale was a delegated one from the sovereign . we must needs inquire then on what principle the sovereign is originally invested with that right . the law itself has already been set forth . but plowdon gives us the reason for it . says plowdon , the whale so caught belongs to the king and queen , “ because of its superior excellence. ” and by the soundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such matters .
melville	moby	ere this , you must have plainly seen the truth of what i started with—that the sperm whale and the right whale have almost entirely different heads . to sum up , then : in the right whale ’ s there is no great well of sperm ; no ivory teeth at all ; no long , slender mandible of a lower jaw , like the sperm whale ’ s . nor in the sperm whale are there any of those blinds of bone ; no huge lower lip ; and scarcely anything of a tongue . again , the right whale has two external spout-holes , the sperm whale only one .
melville	moby	dragged into stubb ’ s boat with blood-shot , blinded eyes , the white brine caking in his wrinkles ; the long tension of ahab ’ s bodily strength did crack , and helplessly he yielded to his body ’ s doom : for a time , lying all crushed in the bottom of stubb ’ s boat , like one trodden under foot of herds of elephants . far inland , nameless wails came from him , as desolate sounds from out ravines .
melville	moby	akin to the adventure of perseus and andromeda—indeed , by some supposed to be indirectly derived from it—is that famous story of st. george and the dragon ; which dragon i maintain to have been a whale ; for in many old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together , and often stand for each other . “ thou art as a lion of the waters , and as a dragon of the sea , ” saith ezekiel ; hereby , plainly meaning a whale ; in truth , some versions of the bible use that word itself . besides , it would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had st. george but encountered a crawling reptile of the land , instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep . any man may kill a snake , but only a perseus , a st. george , a coffin , have the heart in them to march boldly up to a whale .
melville	moby	as for peleg himself , he took it more like a philosopher ; but for all his philosophy , there was a tear twinkling in his eye , when the lantern came too near . and he , too , did not a little run from cabin to deck—now a word below , and now a word with starbuck , the chief mate .
melville	moby	“ the larger whales , they seldom venture to attack . they stand in so great dread of some of them , that when out at sea they are afraid to mention even their names , and carry dung , lime-stone , juniper-wood , and some other articles of the same nature in their boats , in order to terrify and prevent their too near approach. ” —_uno von troil ’ s letters on banks ’ s and solander ’ s voyage to iceland in_ 1772 .
melville	moby	of all the pre-adamite whales yet exhumed , by far the largest is the alabama one mentioned in the last chapter , and that was less than seventy feet in length in the skeleton . whereas , we have already seen , that the tape-measure gives seventy-two feet for the skeleton of a large sized modern whale . and i have heard , on whalemen ’ s authority , that sperm whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of capture .
melville	moby	but it was not this night in particular that , in the solitude of his cabin , ahab thus pondered over his charts . almost every night they were brought out ; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced , and others were substituted . for with the charts of all four oceans before him , ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies , with a view to the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul .
melville	moby	but think not that this famous town has only harpooneers , cannibals , and bumpkins to show her visitors . not at all . still new bedford is a queer place . had it not been for us whalemen , that tract of land would this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of labrador . as it is , parts of her back country are enough to frighten one , they look so bony . the town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in , in all new england . it is a land of oil , true enough : but not like canaan ; a land , also , of corn and wine . the streets do not run with milk ; nor in the spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs . yet , in spite of this , nowhere in all america will you find more patrician-like houses ; parks and gardens more opulent , than in new bedford . whence came they ? how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country ?
melville	moby	but leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists , i would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment , in reference to the sperm whale ’ s hump . this august hump , if i mistake not , rises over one of the larger vertebræ , and is , therefore , in some sort , the outer convex mould of it . from its relative situation then , i should call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the sperm whale . and that the great monster is indomitable , you will yet have reason to know .
melville	moby	soon starbuck returned with a letter in his hand . it was sorely tumbled , damp , and covered with a dull , spotted , green mould , in consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin . of such a letter , death himself might well have been the post-boy .

melville	moby	he was an old man , who , at the age of nearly sixty , had postponedly encountered that thing in sorrow ’ s technicals called ruin . he had been an artisan of famed excellence , and with plenty to do ; owned a house and garden ; embraced a youthful , daughter-like , loving wife , and three blithe , ruddy children ; every sunday went to a cheerful-looking church , planted in a grove . but one night , under cover of darkness , and further concealed in a most cunning disguisement , a desperate burglar slid into his happy home , and robbed them all of everything . and darker yet to tell , the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into his family ’ s heart . it was the bottle conjuror ! upon the opening of that fatal cork , forth flew the fiend , and shrivelled up his home . now , for prudent , most wise , and economic reasons , the blacksmith ’ s shop was in the basement of his dwelling , but with a separate entrance to it ; so that always had the young and loving healthy wife listened with no unhappy nervousness , but with vigorous pleasure , to the stout ringing of her young-armed old husband ’ s hammer ; whose reverberations , muffled by passing through the floors and walls , came up to her , not unsweetly , in her nursery ; and so , to stout labor ’ s iron lullaby , the blacksmith ’ s infants were rocked to slumber .
melville	moby	“ they will last long enough ! pull on ! —but who can tell ” —he muttered— “ whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on ahab ? —but pull on ! aye , all alive , now—we near him . the helm ! take the helm ! let me pass , ” —and so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forward to the bows of the still flying boat .
melville	moby	meantime , overseeing the other part of the ship , captain peleg ripped and swore astern in the most frightful manner . i almost thought he would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up ; involuntarily i paused on my handspike , and told queequeg to do the same , thinking of the perils we both ran , in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a pilot . i was comforting myself , however , with the thought that in pious bildad might be found some salvation , spite of his seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay ; when i felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear , and turning round , was horrified at the apparition of captain peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity . that was my first kick .
melville	moby	sullenly taking the offered lantern , old fleece limped across the deck to the bulwarks ; and then , with one hand dropping his light low over the sea , so as to get a good view of his congregation , with the other hand he solemnly flourished his tongs , and leaning far over the side in a mumbling voice began addressing the sharks , while stubb , softly crawling behind , overheard all that was said .
melville	moby	“ ... and the breath of the whale is frequently attended with such an insupportable smell , as to bring on a disorder of the brain. ” —_ulloa ’ s south america_ . “ to fifty chosen sylphs of special note , we trust the important charge , the petticoat . oft have we known that seven-fold fence to fail , tho ’ stuffed with hoops and armed with ribs of whale. ” —_rape of the lock_ .
melville	moby	as in decapitating the whale , the operator ’ s instrument is brought close to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti magazine ; he has , therefore , to be uncommonly heedful , lest a careless , untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out its invaluable contents . it is this decapitated end of the head , also , which is at last elevated out of the water , and retained in that position by the enormous cutting tackles , whose hempen combinations , on one side , make quite a wilderness of ropes in that quarter .
melville	moby	“ queequeg , ” said i , “ do you think that we can make out a supper for us both on one clam ? ” however , a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before us . but when that smoking chowder came in , the mystery was delightfully explained . oh , sweet friends ! hearken to me . it was made of small juicy clams , scarcely bigger than hazel nuts , mixed with pounded ship biscuit , and salted pork cut up into little flakes ; the whole enriched with butter , and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt . our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage , and in particular , queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him , and the chowder being surpassingly excellent , we despatched it with great expedition : when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of mrs. hussey ’ s clam and cod announcement , i thought i would try a little experiment . stepping to the kitchen door , i uttered the word “ cod ” with great emphasis , and resumed my seat . in a few moments the savoury steam came forth again , but with a different flavor , and in good time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us .
melville	moby	the tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft ; and once more the pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall . a moment or two passed , when starbuck , going forward , pushed against some one . it was stubb . “ what thinkest thou now , man ; i heard thy cry ; it was not the same in the song . ”
melville	moby	“ aye , aye , men ! ” cried ahab . “ look up at it ; mark it well ; the white flame but lights the way to the white whale ! hand me those mainmast links there ; i would fain feel this pulse , and let mine beat against it ; blood against fire ! so . ”
melville	moby	“ avast ! ” roared ahab , dashing him against the bulwarks— “ man the boat ! which way heading ? ” “ good god ! ” cried the english captain , to whom the question was put . “ what ’ s the matter ? he was heading east , i think.—is your captain crazy ? ” whispering fedallah .
melville	moby	upon this every soul was confounded ; for the phenomenon just then observed by ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else ; but its very blinding palpableness must have been the cause .
melville	moby	wherefore , for all these things , we account the whale immortal in his species , however perishable in his individuality . he swam the seas before the continents broke water ; he once swam over the site of the tuileries , and windsor castle , and the kremlin . in noah ’ s flood he despised noah ’ s ark ; and if ever the world is to be again flooded , like the netherlands , to kill off its rats , then the eternal whale will still survive , and rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial flood , spout his frothed defiance to the skies .
melville	moby	at last , passage paid , and luggage safe , we stood on board the schooner . hoisting sail , it glided down the acushnet river . on one side , new bedford rose in terraces of streets , their ice-covered trees all glittering in the clear , cold air . huge hills and mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves , and side by side the world-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last ; while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers , with blended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch , all betokening that new cruises were on the start ; that one most perilous and long voyage ended , only begins a second ; and a second ended , only begins a third , and so on , for ever and for aye . such is the endlessness , yea , the intolerableness of all earthly effort .
melville	moby	“ take another pledge , old man , ” said the parsee , as his eyes lighted up like fire-flies in the gloom— “ hemp only can kill thee. ” “ the gallows , ye mean.—i am immortal then , on land and on sea , ” cried ahab , with a laugh of derision ; — “ immortal on land and on sea ! ”
melville	moby	and thus , through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of queequeg , the deliverance , or rather , delivery of tashtego , was successfully accomplished , in the teeth , too , of the most untoward and apparently hopeless impediments ; which is a lesson by no means to be forgotten . midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing and boxing , riding and rowing .

melville	moby	a short space elapsed , and up into this noiselessness came ahab alone from his cabin . taking a few turns on the quarter-deck , he paused to gaze over the side , then slowly getting into the main-chains he took stubb ’ s long spade—still remaining there after the whale ’ s decapitation—and striking it into the lower part of the half-suspended mass , placed its other end crutch-wise under one arm , and so stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head .
melville	moby	now , the people of the pequod had been baling some time in this way ; several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm ; when all at once a queer accident happened . whether it was that tashtego , that wild indian , was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his one-handed hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head ; or whether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy ; or whether the evil one himself would have it to fall out so , without stating his particular reasons ; how it was exactly , there is no telling now ; but , on a sudden , as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came suckingly up—my god ! poor tashtego—like the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well , dropped head-foremost down into this great tun of heidelburgh , and with a horrible oily gurgling , went clean out of sight !
melville	moby	“ spin me the yarn , ” said ahab ; “ how was it ? ” “ it was the first time in my life that i ever cruised on the line , ” began the englishman . “ i was ignorant of the white whale at that time . well , one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales , and my boat fastened to one of them ; a regular circus horse he was , too , that went milling and milling round so , that my boat ’ s crew could only trim dish , by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale . presently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale , with a milky-white head and hump , all crows ’ feet and wrinkles . ”
melville	moby	“ like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed , still reeling , but with conscience yet pricking him , as the plungings of the roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him ; as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish , praying god for annihilation until the fit be passed ; and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels , a deep stupor steals over him , as over the man who bleeds to death , for conscience is the wound , and there ’ s naught to staunch it ; so , after sore wrestlings in his berth , jonah ’ s prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep .

melville	moby	“ shipmates , this book , containing only four chapters—four yarns—is one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the scriptures . yet what depths of the soul does jonah ’ s deep sealine sound ! what a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet ! what a noble thing is that canticle in the fish ’ s belly ! how billow-like and boisterously grand ! we feel the floods surging over us ; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters ; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us ! but _what_ is this lesson that the book of jonah teaches ? shipmates , it is a two-stranded lesson ; a lesson to us all as sinful men , and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living god . as sinful men , it is a lesson to us all , because it is a story of the sin , hard-heartedness , suddenly awakened fears , the swift punishment , repentance , prayers , and finally the deliverance and joy of jonah . as with all sinners among men , the sin of this son of amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of god—never mind now what that command was , or how conveyed—which he found a hard command . but all the things that god would have us do are hard for us to do—remember that—and hence , he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade . and if we obey god , we must disobey ourselves ; and it is in this disobeying ourselves , wherein the hardness of obeying god consists .

melville	moby	in strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless invisible domineerings of the captain ’ s table , was the entire care-free license and ease , the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows the harpooneers . while their masters , the mates , seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws , the harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was a report to it . they dined like lords ; they filled their bellies like indian ships all day loading with spices . such portentous appetites had queequeg and tashtego , that to fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast , often the pale dough-boy was fain to bring on a great baron of salt-junk , seemingly quarried out of the solid ox . and if he were not lively about it , if he did not go with a nimble hop-skip-and-jump , then tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back , harpoon-wise . and once daggoo , seized with a sudden humor , assisted dough-boy ’ s memory by snatching him up bodily , and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden trencher , while tashtego , knife in hand , began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him . he was naturally a very nervous , shuddering sort of little fellow , this bread-faced steward ; the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse . and what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific ahab , and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages , dough-boy ’ s whole life was one continual lip-quiver . commonly , after seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded , he would escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining , and fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door , till all was over .

melville	moby	it was a humorously perilous business for both of us . for , before we proceed further , it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at both ends ; fast to queequeg ’ s broad canvas belt , and fast to my narrow leather one . so that for better or for worse , we two , for the time , were wedded ; and should poor queequeg sink to rise no more , then both usage and honor demanded , that instead of cutting the cord , it should drag me down in his wake . so , then , an elongated siamese ligature united us . queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother ; nor could i any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed .

melville	moby	time out of mind the piratical proas of the malays , lurking among the low shaded coves and islets of sumatra , have sallied out upon the vessels sailing through the straits , fiercely demanding tribute at the point of their spears . though by the repeated bloody chastisements they have received at the hands of european cruisers , the audacity of these corsairs has of late been somewhat repressed ; yet , even at the present day , we occasionally hear of english and american vessels , which , in those waters , have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged .
melville	moby	“ now jonah ’ s captain , shipmates , was one whose discernment detects crime in any , but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless . in this world , shipmates , sin that pays its way can travel freely , and without a passport ; whereas virtue , if a pauper , is stopped at all frontiers . so jonah ’ s captain prepares to test the length of jonah ’ s purse , ere he judge him openly . he charges him thrice the usual sum ; and it ’ s assented to . then the captain knows that jonah is a fugitive ; but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold . yet when jonah fairly takes out his purse , prudent suspicions still molest the captain . he rings every coin to find a counterfeit . not a forger , any way , he mutters ; and jonah is put down for his passage . ‘ point out my state-room , sir , ’ says jonah now , ‘ i ’ m travel-weary ; i need sleep. ’ ‘ thou lookest like it , ’ says the captain , ‘ there ’ s thy room. ’ jonah enters , and would lock the door , but the lock contains no key . hearing him foolishly fumbling there , the captain laughs lowly to himself , and mutters something about the doors of convicts ’ cells being never allowed to be locked within . all dressed and dusty as he is , jonah throws himself into his berth , and finds the little state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead . the air is close , and jonah gasps . then , in that contracted hole , sunk , too , beneath the ship ’ s water-line , jonah feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour , when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels ’ wards .
melville	moby	“ but as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order , a pale man , with a bandaged head , arrested them—radney the chief mate . ever since the blow , he had lain in his berth ; but that morning , hearing the tumult on the deck , he had crept out , and thus far had watched the whole scene . such was the state of his mouth , that he could hardly speak ; but mumbling something about _his_ being willing and able to do what the captain dared not attempt , he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe .
melville	moby	concerning all this , it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or pulpits , called _crow ’ s-nests_ , in which the look-outs of a greenland whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas . in the fireside narrative of captain sleet , entitled “ a voyage among the icebergs , in quest of the greenland whale , and incidentally for the re-discovery of the lost icelandic colonies of old greenland ; ” in this admirable volume , all standers of mast-heads are furnished with a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented _crow ’ s-nest_ of the glacier , which was the name of captain sleet ’ s good craft . he called it the _sleet ’ s crow ’ s-nest_ , in honor of himself ; he being the original inventor and patentee , and free from all ridiculous false delicacy , and holding that if we call our own children after our own names ( we fathers being the original inventors and patentees ) , so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget . in shape , the sleet ’ s crow ’ s-nest is something like a large tierce or pipe ; it is open above , however , where it is furnished with a movable side-screen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale . being fixed on the summit of the mast , you ascend into it through a little trap-hatch in the bottom . on the after side , or side next the stern of the ship , is a comfortable seat , with a locker underneath for umbrellas , comforters , and coats . in front is a leather rack , in which to keep your speaking trumpet , pipe , telescope , and other nautical conveniences . when captain sleet in person stood his mast-head in this crow ’ s-nest of his , he tells us that he always had a rifle with him ( also fixed in the rack ) , together with a powder flask and shot , for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales , or vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters ; for you can not successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water , but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing . now , it was plainly a labor of love for captain sleet to describe , as he does , all the little detailed conveniences of his crow ’ s-nest ; but though he so enlarges upon many of these , and though he treats us to a very scientific account of his experiments in this crow ’ s-nest , with a small compass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called the “ local attraction ” of all binnacle magnets ; an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship ’ s planks , and in the glacier ’ s case , perhaps , to there having been so many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew ; i say , that though the captain is very discreet and scientific here , yet , for all his learned “ binnacle deviations , ” “ azimuth compass observations , ” and “ approximate errors , ” he knows very well , captain sleet , that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations , as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little case-bottle , so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow ’ s nest , within easy reach of his hand . though , upon the whole , i greatly admire and even love the brave , the honest , and learned captain ; yet i take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that case-bottle , seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been , while with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird ’ s nest within three or four perches of the pole .

melville	moby	is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and immensities of the universe , and thus stabs us from behind with the thought of annihilation , when beholding the white depths of the milky way ? or is it , that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as the visible absence of colour ; and at the same time the concrete of all colours ; is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness , full of meaning , in a wide landscape of snows—a colourless , all-colour of atheism from which we shrink ? and when we consider that other theory of the natural philosophers , that all other earthly hues—every stately or lovely emblazoning—the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods ; yea , and the gilded velvets of butterflies , and the butterfly cheeks of young girls ; all these are but subtile deceits , not actually inherent in substances , but only laid on from without ; so that all deified nature absolutely paints like the harlot , whose allurements cover nothing but the charnel-house within ; and when we proceed further , and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues , the great principle of light , for ever remains white or colorless in itself , and if operating without medium upon matter , would touch all objects , even tulips and roses , with its own blank tinge—pondering all this , the palsied universe lies before us a leper ; and like wilful travellers in lapland , who refuse to wear coloured and colouring glasses upon their eyes , so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him . and of all these things the albino whale was the symbol . wonder ye then at the fiery hunt ?

melville	moby	the try-works are planted between the foremast and mainmast , the most roomy part of the deck . the timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength , fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and mortar , some ten feet by eight square , and five in height . the foundation does not penetrate the deck , but the masonry is firmly secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all sides , and screwing it down to the timbers . on the flanks it is cased with wood , and at top completely covered by a large , sloping , battened hatchway . removing this hatch we expose the great try-pots , two in number , and each of several barrels ’ capacity . when not in use , they are kept remarkably clean . sometimes they are polished with soapstone and sand , till they shine within like silver punch-bowls . during the night-watches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil themselves away there for a nap . while employed in polishing them—one man in each pot , side by side—many confidential communications are carried on , over the iron lips . it is a place also for profound mathematical meditation . it was in the left hand try-pot of the pequod , with the soapstone diligently circling round me , that i was first indirectly struck by the remarkable fact , that in geometry all bodies gliding along the cycloid , my soapstone for example , will descend from any point in precisely the same time .
melville	moby	but not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual celebrity—nay , you may call it an ocean-wide renown ; not only was he famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death , but he was admitted into all the rights , privileges , and distinctions of a name ; had as much a name indeed as cambyses or cæsar . was it not so , o timor tom ! thou famed leviathan , scarred like an iceberg , who so long did ’ st lurk in the oriental straits of that name , whose spout was oft seen from the palmy beach of ombay ? was it not so , o new zealand jack ! thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the vicinity of the tattoo land ? was it not so , o morquan ! king of japan , whose lofty jet they say at times assumed the semblance of a snow-white cross against the sky ? was it not so , o don miguel ! thou chilian whale , marked like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back ! in plain prose , here are four whales as well known to the students of cetacean history as marius or sylla to the classic scholar .
melville	moby	now , however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any creature ’ s skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness , yet in point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption ; because you can not raise any other dense enveloping layer from the whale ’ s body but that same blubber ; and the outermost enveloping layer of any animal , if reasonably dense , what can that be but the skin ? true , from the unmarred dead body of the whale , you may scrape off with your hand an infinitely thin , transparent substance , somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass , only it is almost as flexible and soft as satin ; that is , previous to being dried , when it not only contracts and thickens , but becomes rather hard and brittle . i have several such dried bits , which i use for marks in my whale-books . it is transparent , as i said before ; and being laid upon the printed page , i have sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted a magnifying influence . at any rate , it is pleasant to read about whales through their own spectacles , as you may say . but what i am driving at here is this . that same infinitely thin , isinglass substance , which , i admit , invests the entire body of the whale , is not so much to be regarded as the skin of the creature , as the skin of the skin , so to speak ; for it were simply ridiculous to say , that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a new-born child . but no more of this .

melville	moby	first : the uncertain , unsettled condition of this science of cetology is in the very vestibule attested by the fact , that in some quarters it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish . in his system of nature , a.d. 1776 , linnæus declares , “ i hereby separate the whales from the fish. ” but of my own knowledge , i know that down to the year 1850 , sharks and shad , alewives and herring , against linnæus ’ s express edict , were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the leviathan .

melville	moby	but by far the most wonderful of all cetacean relics was the almost complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster , found in the year 1842 , on the plantation of judge creagh , in alabama . the awe-stricken credulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the fallen angels . the alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile , and bestowed upon it the name of basilosaurus . but some specimen bones of it being taken across the sea to owen , the english anatomist , it turned out that this alleged reptile was a whale , though of a departed species . a significant illustration of the fact , again and again repeated in this book , that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the shape of his fully invested body . so owen rechristened the monster zeuglodon ; and in his paper read before the london geological society , pronounced it , in substance , one of the most extraordinary creatures which the mutations of the globe have blotted out of existence .
melville	moby	meantime , they hauled more and more upon their lines , till close flanking him on both sides , stubb answered flask with lance for lance ; and thus round and round the pequod the battle went , while the multitudes of sharks that had before swum round the sperm whale ’ s body , rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled , thirstily drinking at every new gash , as the eager israelites did at the new bursting fountains that poured from the smitten rock .
melville	moby	until the whale fishery rounded cape horn , no commerce but colonial , scarcely any intercourse but colonial , was carried on between europe and the long line of the opulent spanish provinces on the pacific coast . it was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy of the spanish crown , touching those colonies ; and , if space permitted , it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated the liberation of peru , chili , and bolivia from the yoke of old spain , and the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts .
melville	moby	in vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard ; suspended a cutlass over his naked wrists ; queequeg was the son of a king , and queequeg budged not . struck by his desperate dauntlessness , and his wild desire to visit christendom , the captain at last relented , and told him he might make himself at home . but this fine young savage—this sea prince of wales , never saw the captain ’ s cabin . they put him down among the sailors , and made a whaleman of him . but like czar peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities , queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy , if thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen . for at bottom—so he told me—he was actuated by a profound desire to learn among the christians , the arts whereby to make his people still happier than they were ; and more than that , still better than they were . but , alas ! the practices of whalemen soon convinced him that even christians could be both miserable and wicked ; infinitely more so , than all his father ’ s heathens . arrived at last in old sag harbor ; and seeing what the sailors did there ; and then going on to nantucket , and seeing how they spent their wages in _that_ place also , poor queequeg gave it up for lost . thought he , it ’ s a wicked world in all meridians ; i ’ ll die a pagan .
melville	moby	but he stole up to us again , and suddenly clapping his hand on my shoulder , said— “ did ye see anything looking like men going towards that ship a while ago ? ” struck by this plain matter-of-fact question , i answered , saying , “ yes , i thought i did see four or five men ; but it was too dim to be sure . ”
melville	moby	“ what are you jabbering about , shipmate ? ” said i . “ _he ’ s_ got enough , though , to make up for all deficiencies of that sort in other chaps , ” abruptly said the stranger , placing a nervous emphasis upon the word _he_ .
melville	moby	while yet the wondering ship ’ s company were gazing upon these strangers , ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their head , “ all ready there , fedallah ? ” “ ready , ” was the half-hissed reply .
melville	moby	indeed , in other respects , you can hardly regard any creatures of the deep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore . for though some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their kind in the sea ; and though taking a broad general view of the thing , this may very well be ; yet coming to specialties , where , for example , does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog ? the accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him .
melville	moby	meanwhile , whatever were his own secret thoughts , starbuck said nothing , but quietly he issued all requisite orders ; while stubb and flask—who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his feelings—likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced . as for the men , though some of them lowly rumbled , their fear of ahab was greater than their fear of fate . but as ever before , the pagan harpooneers remained almost wholly unimpressed ; or if impressed , it was only with a certain magnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible ahab ’ s .
melville	moby	chapter 99 . the doubloon . chapter 100 . leg and arm . chapter 101 . the decanter . chapter 102 . a bower in the arsacides . chapter 103 . measurement of the whale ’ s skeleton . chapter 104 . the fossil whale .
melville	moby	both ends of the line are exposed ; the lower end terminating in an eye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub , and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything . this arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts . first : in order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat , in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon . in these instances , the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale , as it were , from the one boat to the other ; though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort . second : this arrangement is indispensable for common safety ’ s sake ; for were the lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat , and were the whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single , smoking minute as he sometimes does , he would not stop there , for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of the sea ; and in that case no town-crier would ever find her again .
melville	moby	chapter 52 . the albatross . south-eastward from the cape , off the distant crozetts , a good cruising ground for right whalemen , a sail loomed ahead , the goney ( albatross ) by name . as she slowly drew nigh , from my lofty perch at the fore-mast-head , i had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean fisheries—a whaler at sea , and long absent from home .
melville	moby	i say , we good presbyterian christians should be charitable in these things , and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals , pagans and what not , because of their half-crazy conceits on these subjects . there was queequeg , now , certainly entertaining the most absurd notions about yojo and his ramadan ; —but what of that ? queequeg thought he knew what he was about , i suppose ; he seemed to be content ; and there let him rest . all our arguing with him would not avail ; let him be , i say : and heaven have mercy on us all—presbyterians and pagans alike—for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head , and sadly need mending .
melville	moby	but before going further , it is important to mention here , that though the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance , yet it is seldom done ; and when done , is still less frequently successful , on account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as compared with the lance , which in effect become serious drawbacks . as a general thing , therefore , you must first get fast to a whale , before any pitchpoling comes into play .
melville	moby	“ who told thee that ? ” cried ahab ; then pausing , “ aye , starbuck ; aye , my hearties all round ; it was moby dick that dismasted me ; moby dick that brought me to this dead stump i stand on now . aye , aye , ” he shouted with a terrific , loud , animal sob , like that of a heart-stricken moose ; “ aye , aye ! it was that accursed white whale that razed me ; made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day ! ” then tossing both arms , with measureless imprecations he shouted out : “ aye , aye ! and i ’ ll chase him round good hope , and round the horn , and round the norway maelstrom , and round perdition ’ s flames before i give him up . and this is what ye have shipped for , men ! to chase that white whale on both sides of land , and over all sides of earth , till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out . what say ye , men , will ye splice hands on it , now ? i think ye do look brave . ”
melville	moby	“ ‘ yes , rather oddish , ’ said the lakeman , holding it at arm ’ s length before him ; ‘ but i think it will answer . shipmate , i haven ’ t enough twine , —have you any ? ’ “ but there was none in the forecastle .
melville	moby	“ haul in ! haul in ! ” cried starbuck again ; “ he ’ s rising. ” the lines , of which , hardly an instant before , not one hand ’ s breadth could have been gained , were now in long quick coils flung back all dripping into the boats , and soon the whale broke water within two ship ’ s lengths of the hunters .
melville	moby	“ there is some sneaking temperance society movement about this business , ” he suddenly added , now approaching starbuck , who had just come from forward . “ will you look at that kannakin , sir : smell of it , if you please. ” then watching the mate ’ s countenance , he added , “ the steward , mr. starbuck , had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to queequeg , there , this instant off the whale . is the steward an apothecary , sir ? and may i ask whether this is the sort of bitters by which he blows back the life into a half-drowned man ? ”
melville	moby	chapter 94 . a squeeze of the hand . that whale of stubb ’ s , so dearly purchased , was duly brought to the pequod ’ s side , where all those cutting and hoisting operations previously detailed , were regularly gone through , even to the baling of the heidelburgh tun , or case .
melville	moby	there are two royal fish so styled by the english law writers—the whale and the sturgeon ; both royal property under certain limitations , and nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown ’ s ordinary revenue . i know not that any other author has hinted of the matter ; but by inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same way as the whale , the king receiving the highly dense and elastic head peculiar to that fish , which , symbolically regarded , may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality . and thus there seems a reason in all things , even in law .
melville	moby	“ there now ’ s the old mogul , ” soliloquized stubb by the try-works , “ he ’ s been twigging it ; and there goes starbuck from the same , and both with faces which i should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long . and all from looking at a piece of gold , which did i have it now on negro hill or in corlaer ’ s hook , i ’ d not look at it very long ere spending it . humph ! in my poor , insignificant opinion , i regard this as queer . i have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings ; your doubloons of old spain , your doubloons of peru , your doubloons of chili , your doubloons of bolivia , your doubloons of popayan ; with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles , and joes , and half joes , and quarter joes . what then should there be in this doubloon of the equator that is so killing wonderful ? by golconda ! let me read it once . halloa ! here ’ s signs and wonders truly ! that , now , is what old bowditch in his epitome calls the zodiac , and what my almanac below calls ditto . i ’ ll get the almanac and as i have heard devils can be raised with daboll ’ s arithmetic , i ’ ll try my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with the massachusetts calendar . here ’ s the book . let ’ s see now . signs and wonders ; and the sun , he ’ s always among ’ em . hem , hem , hem ; here they are—here they go—all alive : —aries , or the ram ; taurus , or the bull and jimimi ! here ’ s gemini himself , or the twins . well ; the sun he wheels among ’ em . aye , here on the coin he ’ s just crossing the threshold between two of twelve sitting-rooms all in a ring . book ! you lie there ; the fact is , you books must know your places . you ’ ll do to give us the bare words and facts , but we come in to supply the thoughts . that ’ s my small experience , so far as the massachusetts calendar , and bowditch ’ s navigator , and daboll ’ s arithmetic go . signs and wonders , eh ? pity if there is nothing wonderful in signs , and significant in wonders ! there ’ s a clue somewhere ; wait a bit ; hist—hark ! by jove , i have it ! look you , doubloon , your zodiac here is the life of man in one round chapter ; and now i ’ ll read it off , straight out of the book . come , almanack ! to begin : there ’ s aries , or the ram—lecherous dog , he begets us ; then , taurus , or the bull—he bumps us the first thing ; then gemini , or the twins—that is , virtue and vice ; we try to reach virtue , when lo ! comes cancer the crab , and drags us back ; and here , going from virtue , leo , a roaring lion , lies in the path—he gives a few fierce bites and surly dabs with his paw ; we escape , and hail virgo , the virgin ! that ’ s our first love ; we marry and think to be happy for aye , when pop comes libra , or the scales—happiness weighed and found wanting ; and while we are very sad about that , lord ! how we suddenly jump , as scorpio , or the scorpion , stings us in the rear ; we are curing the wound , when whang come the arrows all round ; sagittarius , or the archer , is amusing himself . as we pluck out the shafts , stand aside ! here ’ s the battering-ram , capricornus , or the goat ; full tilt , he comes rushing , and headlong we are tossed ; when aquarius , or the water-bearer , pours out his whole deluge and drowns us ; and to wind up with pisces , or the fishes , we sleep . there ’ s a sermon now , writ in high heaven , and the sun goes through it every year , and yet comes out of it all alive and hearty . jollily he , aloft there , wheels through toil and trouble ; and so , alow here , does jolly stubb . oh , jolly ’ s the word for aye ! adieu , doubloon ! but stop ; here comes little king-post ; dodge round the try-works , now , and let ’ s hear what he ’ ll have to say . there ; he ’ s before it ; he ’ ll out with something presently . so , so ; he ’ s beginning . ”
melville	moby	oh ! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass ; who standing among flowers can say—here , _here_ lies my beloved ; ye know not the desolation that broods in bosoms like these . what bitter blanks in those black-bordered marbles which cover no ashes ! what despair in those immovable inscriptions ! what deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all faith , and refuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished without a grave . as well might those tablets stand in the cave of elephanta as here .
melville	moby	“ roll on , thou deep and dark blue ocean , roll ! ten thousand blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain. ” very often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded young philosophers to task , upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient “ interest ” in the voyage ; half-hinting that they are so hopelessly lost to all honorable ambition , as that in their secret souls they would rather not see whales than otherwise . but all in vain ; those young platonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect ; they are short-sighted ; what use , then , to strain the visual nerve ? they have left their opera-glasses at home .
melville	moby	it was a black and hooded head ; and hanging there in the midst of so intense a calm , it seemed the sphynx ’ s in the desert . “ speak , thou vast and venerable head , ” muttered ahab , “ which , though ungarnished with a beard , yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses ; speak , mighty head , and tell us the secret thing that is in thee . of all divers , thou hast dived the deepest . that head upon which the upper sun now gleams , has moved amid this world ’ s foundations . where unrecorded names and navies rust , and untold hopes and anchors rot ; where in her murderous hold this frigate earth is ballasted with bones of millions of the drowned ; there , in that awful water-land , there was thy most familiar home . thou hast been where bell or diver never went ; hast slept by many a sailor ’ s side , where sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay them down . thou saw ’ st the locked lovers when leaping from their flaming ship ; heart to heart they sank beneath the exulting wave ; true to each other , when heaven seemed false to them . thou saw ’ st the murdered mate when tossed by pirates from the midnight deck ; for hours he fell into the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw ; and his murderers still sailed on unharmed—while swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that would have borne a righteous husband to outstretched , longing arms . o head ! thou hast seen enough to split the planets and make an infidel of abraham , and not one syllable is thine ! ”
melville	moby	from the ship ’ s bows , nearly all the seamen now hung inactive ; hammers , bits of plank , lances , and harpoons , mechanically retained in their hands , just as they had darted from their various employments ; all their enchanted eyes intent upon the whale , which from side to side strangely vibrating his predestinating head , sent a broad band of overspreading semicircular foam before him as he rushed . retribution , swift vengeance , eternal malice were in his whole aspect , and spite of all that mortal man could do , the solid white buttress of his forehead smote the ship ’ s starboard bow , till men and timbers reeled . some fell flat upon their faces . like dislodged trucks , the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook on their bull-like necks . through the breach , they heard the waters pour , as mountain torrents down a flume .
melville	moby	queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper , and lighted his tomahawk pipe . i sat at the feet . we kept the pipe passing over the sleeper , from one to the other . meanwhile , upon questioning him in his broken fashion , queequeg gave me to understand that , in his land , owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts , the king , chiefs , and great people generally , were in the custom of fattening some of the lower orders for ottomans ; and to furnish a house comfortably in that respect , you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellows , and lay them round in the piers and alcoves . besides , it was very convenient on an excursion ; much better than those garden-chairs which are convertible into walking-sticks ; upon occasion , a chief calling his attendant , and desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree , perhaps in some damp marshy place .
melville	moby	“ captain peleg , ” said bildad steadily , “ thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water , or ten fathoms , i can ’ t tell ; but as thou art still an impenitent man , captain peleg , i greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one ; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit , captain peleg . ”
melville	moby	some hours after midnight , the typhoon abated so much , that through the strenuous exertions of starbuck and stubb—one engaged forward and the other aft—the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and main-top-sails were cut adrift from the spars , and went eddying away to leeward , like the feathers of an albatross , which sometimes are cast to the winds when that storm-tossed bird is on the wing .
melville	moby	since i have undertaken to manhandle this leviathan , it behooves me to approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise ; not overlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood , and spinning him out to the uttermost coil of his bowels . having already described him in most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities , it now remains to magnify him in an archæological , fossiliferous , and antediluvian point of view . applied to any other creature than the leviathan—to an ant or a flea—such portly terms might justly be deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent . but when leviathan is the text , the case is altered . fain am i to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest words of the dictionary . and here be it said , that whenever it has been convenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations , i have invariably used a huge quarto edition of johnson , expressly purchased for that purpose ; because that famous lexicographer ’ s uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author like me .
melville	moby	“ i am mistaken then . i thought i was speaking to the captain himself. ” “ thou art speaking to captain peleg—that ’ s who ye are speaking to , young man . it belongs to me and captain bildad to see the pequod fitted out for the voyage , and supplied with all her needs , including crew . we are part owners and agents . but as i was going to say , if thou wantest to know what whaling is , as thou tellest ye do , i can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it , past backing out . clap eye on captain ahab , young man , and thou wilt find that he has only one leg . ”
melville	moby	was there ever such unconsciousness ? he did not seem to think that he at all deserved a medal from the humane and magnanimous societies . he only asked for water—fresh water—something to wipe the brine off ; that done , he put on dry clothes , lighted his pipe , and leaning against the bulwarks , and mildly eyeing those around him , seemed to be saying to himself— “ it ’ s a mutual , joint-stock world , in all meridians . we cannibals must help these christians . ”
melville	moby	“ ‘ also bear with all of us , sir sailor ; for we all join in don sebastian ’ s suit , ’ cried the company , with exceeding interest . “ ‘ is there a copy of the holy evangelists in the golden inn , gentlemen ? ’
melville	moby	now , that lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the door of dives , this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be moored to one of the moluccas . yet dives himself , he too lives like a czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs , and being a president of a temperance society , he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans .
melville	moby	the ship tore on ; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a cannon-ball , missent , becomes a plough-share and turns up the level field . “ by salt and hemp ! ” cried stubb , “ but this swift motion of the deck creeps up one ’ s legs and tingles at the heart . this ship and i are two brave fellows ! —ha , ha ! some one take me up , and launch me , spine-wise , on the sea , —for by live-oaks ! my spine ’ s a keel . ha , ha ! we go the gait that leaves no dust behind ! ”
melville	moby	but look at this matter in other lights ; weigh it in all sorts of scales ; see what we whalemen are , and have been . why did the dutch in de witt ’ s time have admirals of their whaling fleets ? why did louis xvi . of france , at his own personal expense , fit out whaling ships from dunkirk , and politely invite to that town some score or two of families from our own island of nantucket ? why did britain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties upwards of £1,000,000 ? and lastly , how comes it that we whalemen of america now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world ; sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels ; manned by eighteen thousand men ; yearly consuming 4,000,000 of dollars ; the ships worth , at the time of sailing , $ 20,000,000 ! and every year importing into our harbors a well reaped harvest of $ 7,000,000 . how comes all this , if there be not something puissant in whaling ?
melville	moby	nor , considered aright , does it seem any argument in favour of the gradual extinction of the sperm whale , for example , that in former years ( the latter part of the last century , say ) these leviathans , in small pods , were encountered much oftener than at present , and , in consequence , the voyages were not so prolonged , and were also much more remunerative . because , as has been elsewhere noticed , those whales , influenced by some views to safety , now swim the seas in immense caravans , so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries , yokes , and pods , and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but widely separated , unfrequent armies . that is all . and equally fallacious seems the conceit , that because the so-called whale-bone whales no longer haunt many grounds in former years abounding with them , hence that species also is declining . for they are only being driven from promontory to cape ; and if one coast is no longer enlivened with their jets , then , be sure , some other and remoter strand has been very recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle .
melville	moby	“ nantucket market ! hoot ! but come closer , starbuck ; thou requirest a little lower layer . if money ’ s to be the measurer , man , and the accountants have computed their great counting-house the globe , by girdling it with guineas , one to every three parts of an inch ; then , let me tell thee , that my vengeance will fetch a great premium _here ! _ ”
melville	moby	“ a steak , a steak , ere i sleep ! you , daggoo ! overboard you go , and cut me one from his small ! ” here be it known , that though these wild fishermen do not , as a general thing , and according to the great military maxim , make the enemy defray the current expenses of the war ( at least before realizing the proceeds of the voyage ) , yet now and then you find some of these nantucketers who have a genuine relish for that particular part of the sperm whale designated by stubb ; comprising the tapering extremity of the body .
melville	moby	if i say , that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable to vitality , inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a certain element , which being subsequently brought into contact with the blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle , i do not think i shall err ; though i may possibly use some superfluous scientific words . assume it , and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be aerated with one breath , he might then seal up his nostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time . that is to say , he would then live without breathing . anomalous as it may seem , this is precisely the case with the whale , who systematically lives , by intervals , his full hour and more ( when at the bottom ) without drawing a single breath , or so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air ; for , remember , he has no gills . how is this ? between his ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable involved cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like vessels , which vessels , when he quits the surface , are completely distended with oxygenated blood . so that for an hour or more , a thousand fathoms in the sea , he carries a surplus stock of vitality in him , just as the camel crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four supplementary stomachs . the anatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable ; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true , seems the more cogent to me , when i consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in _having his spoutings out_ , as the fishermen phrase it . this is what i mean . if unmolested , upon rising to the surface , the sperm whale will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings . say he stays eleven minutes , and jets seventy times , that is , respires seventy breaths ; then whenever he rises again , he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again , to a minute . now , if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him , so that he sounds , he will be always dodging up again to make good his regular allowance of air . and not till those seventy breaths are told , will he finally go down to stay out his full term below . remark , however , that in different individuals these rates are different ; but in any one they are alike . now , why should the whale thus insist upon having his spoutings out , unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air , ere descending for good ? how obvious is it , too , that this necessity for the whale ’ s rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase . for not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught , when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight . not so much thy skill , then , o hunter , as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee !
melville	moby	the narwhale has a very picturesque , leopard-like look , being of a milk-white ground colour , dotted with round and oblong spots of black . his oil is very superior , clear and fine ; but there is little of it , and he is seldom hunted . he is mostly found in the circumpolar seas .
melville	moby	“ i believe it did , sir ; does the ferrule stand , sir ? ” “ well enough . but art thou not also the undertaker ? ” “ aye , sir ; i patched up this thing here as a coffin for queequeg ; but they ’ ve set me now to turning it into something else . ”
melville	moby	whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery , there is no telling , but i rolled about a good deal , and could not sleep for a long time . at last i slid off into a light doze , and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of nod , when i heard a heavy footfall in the passage , and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under the door .
melville	moby	nevertheless the sun hides not virginia ’ s dismal swamp , nor rome ’ s accursed campagna , nor wide sahara , nor all the millions of miles of deserts and of griefs beneath the moon . the sun hides not the ocean , which is the dark side of this earth , and which is two thirds of this earth . so , therefore , that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow in him , that mortal man can not be true—not true , or undeveloped . with books the same . the truest of all men was the man of sorrows , and the truest of all books is solomon ’ s , and ecclesiastes is the fine hammered steel of woe . “ all is vanity. ” all . this wilful world hath not got hold of unchristian solomon ’ s wisdom yet . but he who dodges hospitals and jails , and walks fast crossing graveyards , and would rather talk of operas than hell ; calls cowper , young , pascal , rousseau , poor devils all of sick men ; and throughout a care-free lifetime swears by rabelais as passing wise , and therefore jolly ; —not that man is fitted to sit down on tomb-stones , and break the green damp mould with unfathomably wondrous solomon .
melville	moby	* i remember the first albatross i ever saw . it was during a prolonged gale , in waters hard upon the antarctic seas . from my forenoon watch below , i ascended to the overclouded deck ; and there , dashed upon the main hatches , i saw a regal , feathery thing of unspotted whiteness , and with a hooked , roman bill sublime . at intervals , it arched forth its vast archangel wings , as if to embrace some holy ark . wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook it . though bodily unharmed , it uttered cries , as some king ’ s ghost in supernatural distress . through its inexpressible , strange eyes , methought i peeped to secrets which took hold of god . as abraham before the angels , i bowed myself ; the white thing was so white , its wings so wide , and in those for ever exiled waters , i had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns . long i gazed at that prodigy of plumage . i can not tell , can only hint , the things that darted through me then . but at last i awoke ; and turning , asked a sailor what bird was this . a goney , he replied . goney ! never had heard that name before ; is it conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore ! never ! but some time after , i learned that goney was some seaman ’ s name for albatross . so that by no possibility could coleridge ’ s wild rhyme have had aught to do with those mystical impressions which were mine , when i saw that bird upon our deck . for neither had i then read the rhyme , nor knew the bird to be an albatross . yet , in saying this , i do but indirectly burnish a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet .
melville	moby	now , during the past night and forenoon , the pequod had gradually drifted into a sea , which , by its occasional patches of yellow brit , gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of right whales , a species of the leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking anywhere near . and though all hands commonly disdained the capture of those inferior creatures ; and though the pequod was not commissioned to cruise for them at all , and though she had passed numbers of them near the crozetts without lowering a boat ; yet now that a sperm whale had been brought alongside and beheaded , to the surprise of all , the announcement was made that a right whale should be captured that day , if opportunity offered .

melville	moby	but what it was that inscrutable ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew of his—these were words best omitted here ; for you live under the blessed light of the evangelical land . only the infidel sharks in the audacious seas may give ear to such words , when , with tornado brow , and eyes of red murder , and foam-glued lips , ahab leaped after his prey .

melville	moby	“ hast thou seen the white whale ? ” demanded ahab , when the boat drifted back . “ think , think of thy whale-boat , stoven and sunk ! beware of the horrible tail ! ” “ i tell thee again , gabriel , that— ” but again the boat tore ahead as if dragged by fiends . nothing was said for some moments , while a succession of riotous waves rolled by , which by one of those occasional caprices of the seas were tumbling , not heaving it . meantime , the hoisted sperm whale ’ s head jogged about very violently , and gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature seemed to warrant .
melville	moby	soon all the boats but starbuck ’ s were dropped ; all the boat-sails set—all the paddles plying ; with rippling swiftness , shooting to leeward ; and ahab heading the onset . a pale , death-glimmer lit up fedallah ’ s sunken eyes ; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth .
melville	moby	but quitting all these unprofessional attempts , let us glance at those pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober , scientific delineations , by those who know . in old harris ’ s collection of voyages there are some plates of whales extracted from a dutch book of voyages , a.d. 1671 , entitled “ a whaling voyage to spitzbergen in the ship jonas in the whale , peter peterson of friesland , master. ” in one of those plates the whales , like great rafts of logs , are represented lying among ice-isles , with white bears running over their living backs . in another plate , the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular flukes .
melville	moby	thus speak of the whale , the great cuvier , and john hunter , and lesson , those lights of zoology and anatomy . nevertheless , though of real knowledge there be little , yet of books there are a plenty ; and so in some small degree , with cetology , or the science of whales . many are the men , small and great , old and new , landsmen and seamen , who have at large or in little , written of the whale . run over a few : —the authors of the bible ; aristotle ; pliny ; aldrovandi ; sir thomas browne ; gesner ; ray ; linnæus ; rondeletius ; willoughby ; green ; artedi ; sibbald ; brisson ; marten ; lacépède ; bonneterre ; desmarest ; baron cuvier ; frederick cuvier ; john hunter ; owen ; scoresby ; beale ; bennett ; j. ross browne ; the author of miriam coffin ; olmstead ; and the rev . t. cheever . but to what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written , the above cited extracts will show .

melville	moby	“ three spaniards ? adventures of those three bloody-minded soldadoes ? did ye read it there , flask ? i guess ye did ? ” “ no : never saw such a book ; heard of it , though . but now , tell me , stubb , do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now , was the same you say is now on board the pequod ? ”
melville	moby	“ why , thou monkey , ” said a harpooneer to one of these lads , “ we ’ ve been cruising now hard upon three years , and thou hast not raised a whale yet . whales are scarce as hen ’ s teeth whenever thou art up here. ” perhaps they were ; or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in the far horizon ; but lulled into such an opium-like listlessness of vacant , unconscious reverie is this absent-minded youth by the blending cadence of waves with thoughts , that at last he loses his identity ; takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep , blue , bottomless soul , pervading mankind and nature ; and every strange , half-seen , gliding , beautiful thing that eludes him ; every dimly-discovered , uprising fin of some undiscernible form , seems to him the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through it . in this enchanted mood , thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came ; becomes diffused through time and space ; like cranmer ’ s sprinkled pantheistic ashes , forming at last a part of every shore the round globe over .
melville	moby	“ cap ’ ain , you see him small drop tar on water dere ? you see him ? well , spose him one whale eye , well , den ! ” and taking sharp aim at it , he darted the iron right over old bildad ’ s broad brim , clean across the ship ’ s decks , and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight .
melville	moby	this midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing , when , some days after , lo ! at the same silent hour , it was again announced : again it was descried by all ; but upon making sail to overtake it , once more it disappeared as if it had never been . and so it served us night after night , till no one heeded it but to wonder at it . mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight , or starlight , as the case might be ; disappearing again for one whole day , or two days , or three ; and somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and further in our van , this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on .
melville	moby	at last the shank , in one complete rod , received its final heat ; and as perth , to temper it , plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near by , the scalding steam shot up into ahab ’ s bent face .

melville	moby	natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness of the more enormous creatures of the globe , yet what shall we say to harto , the historian of goa , when he tells us that at one hunting the king of siam took 4,000 elephants ; that in those regions elephants are numerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes . and there seems no reason to doubt that if these elephants , which have now been hunted for thousands of years , by semiramis , by porus , by hannibal , and by all the successive monarchs of the east—if they still survive there in great numbers , much more may the great whale outlast all hunting , since he has a pasture to expatiate in , which is precisely twice as large as all asia , both americas , europe and africa , new holland , and all the isles of the sea combined .
melville	moby	“ and he took that arm off , did he ? ” asked ahab , now sliding down from the capstan , and resting on the englishman ’ s shoulder , as he did so . “ aye , he was the cause of it , at least ; and that leg , too ? ”
melville	moby	it is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent ramblings . like fashionables , they are for ever on the move in leisurely search of variety . you meet them on the line in time for the full flower of the equatorial feeding season , having just returned , perhaps , from spending the summer in the northern seas , and so cheating summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth . by the time they have lounged up and down the promenade of the equator awhile , they start for the oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there , and so evade the other excessive temperature of the year .
melville	moby	it drew near the close of day . suddenly he came to a halt by the bulwarks , and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there , and with one hand grasping a shroud , he ordered starbuck to send everybody aft .
melville	moby	while still warm , the oil , like hot punch , is received into the six-barrel casks ; and while , perhaps , the ship is pitching and rolling this way and that in the midnight sea , the enormous casks are slewed round and headed over , end for end , and sometimes perilously scoot across the slippery deck , like so many land slides , till at last man-handled and stayed in their course ; and all round the hoops , rap , rap , go as many hammers as can play upon them , for now , _ex officio_ , every sailor is a cooper .
melville	moby	they were one man , not thirty . for as the one ship that held them all ; though it was put together of all contrasting things—oak , and maple , and pine wood ; iron , and pitch , and hemp—yet all these ran into each other in the one concrete hull , which shot on its way , both balanced and directed by the long central keel ; even so , all the individualities of the crew , this man ’ s valor , that man ’ s fear ; guilt and guiltiness , all varieties were welded into oneness , and were all directed to that fatal goal which ahab their one lord and keel did point to .
melville	moby	“ who would have thought it , flask ! ” cried stubb ; “ if i had but one leg you would not catch me in a boat , unless maybe to stop the plug-hole with my timber toe . oh ! he ’ s a wonderful old man ! ”
melville	moby	the rigging lived . the mast-heads , like the tops of tall palms , were outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs . clinging to a spar with one hand , some reached forth the other with impatient wavings ; others , shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight , sat far out on the rocking yards ; all the spars in full bearing of mortals , ready and ripe for their fate . ah ! how they still strove through that infinite blueness to seek out the thing that might destroy them !
melville	moby	but sometimes , especially upon the line in the pacific , this plan will not answer at all ; because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather round the moored carcase , that were he left so for six hours , say , on a stretch , little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning . in most other parts of the ocean , however , where these fish do not so largely abound , their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably diminished , by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling-spades , a procedure notwithstanding , which , in some instances , only seems to tickle them into still greater activity . but it was not thus in the present case with the pequod ’ s sharks ; though , to be sure , any man unaccustomed to such sights , to have looked over her side that night , would have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese , and those sharks the maggots in it .
melville	moby	while some were occupied with this latter duty , others were employed in dragging away the larger tubs , so soon as filled with the sperm ; and when the proper time arrived , this same sperm was carefully manipulated ere going to the try-works , of which anon .
melville	moby	meanwhile , all the boats tore on . the repeated specific allusions of flask to “ that whale , ” as he called the fictitious monster which he declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat ’ s bow with its tail—these allusions of his were at times so vivid and life-like , that they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look over the shoulder . but this was against all rule ; for the oarsmen must put out their eyes , and ram a skewer through their necks ; usage pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears , and no limbs but arms , in these critical moments .
melville	moby	“ the boat ! the boat ! ” cried starbuck , “ look at thy boat , old man ! ” ahab ’ s harpoon , the one forged at perth ’ s fire , remained firmly lashed in its conspicuous crotch , so that it projected beyond his whale-boat ’ s bow ; but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather sheath to drop off ; and from the keen steel barb there now came a levelled flame of pale , forked fire . as the silent harpoon burned there like a serpent ’ s tongue , starbuck grasped ahab by the arm— “ god , god is against thee , old man ; forbear ! ’ tis an ill voyage ! ill begun , ill continued ; let me square the yards , while we may , old man , and make a fair wind of it homewards , to go on a better voyage than this . ”
melville	moby	i now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image , feeling but ill at ease meantime—to see what was next to follow . first he takes about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket , and places them carefully before the idol ; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp , he kindled the shavings into a sacrificial blaze . presently , after many hasty snatches into the fire , and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers ( whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly ) , he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit ; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little , he made a polite offer of it to the little negro . but the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all ; he never moved his lips . all these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee , who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other , during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner . at last extinguishing the fire , he took the idol up very unceremoniously , and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock .
melville	moby	old age is always wakeful ; as if , the longer linked with life , the less man has to do with aught that looks like death . among sea-commanders , the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the night-cloaked deck . it was so with ahab ; only that now , of late , he seemed so much to live in the open air , that truly speaking , his visits were more to the cabin , than from the cabin to the planks . “ it feels like going down into one ’ s tomb , ” —he would mutter to himself— “ for an old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle , to go to my grave-dug berth . ”
melville	moby	ahab stood before him , and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty turns to form a preliminary hand-coil to toss overboard , when the old manxman , who was intently eyeing both him and the line , made bold to speak .
melville	moby	“ i know that well enough ; but , d ’ ye see , the captain here won ’ t believe it ; this is his first voyage ; he was a cologne manufacturer before . but come aboard , and mayhap he ’ ll believe you , if he won ’ t me ; and so i ’ ll get out of this dirty scrape . ”
melville	moby	“ no , no , it wasn ’ t ; i said the corpusants have mercy on us all ; and i hope they will , still . but do they only have mercy on long faces ? —have they no bowels for a laugh ? and look ye , mr. starbuck—but it ’ s too dark to look . hear me , then : i take that mast-head flame we saw for a sign of good luck ; for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be chock a ’ block with sperm-oil , d ’ ye see ; and so , all that sperm will work up into the masts , like sap in a tree . yes , our three masts will yet be as three spermaceti candles—that ’ s the good promise we saw . ”
melville	moby	“ i will not go , ” said the stranger , “ till you say _aye_ to me . do to me as you would have me do to you in the like case . for _you_ too have a boy , captain ahab—though but a child , and nestling safely at home now—a child of your old age too—yes , yes , you relent ; i see it—run , run , men , now , and stand by to square in the yards . ”
melville	moby	at that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed , and instantly , then , in accordance with their singular ways , shoals of small harmless fish , that for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side , darted away with what seemed shuddering fins , and ranged themselves fore and aft with the stranger ’ s flanks . though in the course of his continual voyagings ahab must often before have noticed a similar sight , yet , to any monomaniac man , the veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings .
melville	moby	“ ‘ this is the priest , he brings you the evangelists , ’ said don sebastian , gravely , returning with a tall and solemn figure . “ ‘ let me remove my hat . now , venerable priest , further into the light , and hold the holy book before me that i may touch it .
melville	moby	chapter 59 . squid . slowly wading through the meadows of brit , the pequod still held on her way north-eastward towards the island of java ; a gentle air impelling her keel , so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering masts mildly waved to that languid breeze , as three mild palms on a plain . and still , at wide intervals in the silvery night , the lonely , alluring jet would be seen .
melville	moby	but it is a ponderous task ; no ordinary letter-sorter in the post-office is equal to it . to grope down into the bottom of the sea after them ; to have one ’ s hands among the unspeakable foundations , ribs , and very pelvis of the world ; this is a fearful thing . what am i that i should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan ! the awful tauntings in job might well appal me . will he ( the leviathan ) make a covenant with thee ? behold the hope of him is vain ! but i have swam through libraries and sailed through oceans ; i have had to do with whales with these visible hands ; i am in earnest ; and i will try . there are some preliminaries to settle .
melville	moby	i sat down on the side of the bed , and commenced thinking about this head-peddling harpooneer , and his door mat . after thinking some time on the bed-side , i got up and took off my monkey jacket , and then stood in the middle of the room thinking . i then took off my coat , and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves . but beginning to feel very cold now , half undressed as i was , and remembering what the landlord said about the harpooneer ’ s not coming home at all that night , it being so very late , i made no more ado , but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots , and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed , and commended myself to the care of heaven .
melville	moby	it may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head standers of the land with those of the sea ; but that in truth it is not so , is plainly evinced by an item for which obed macy , the sole historian of nantucket , stands accountable . the worthy obed tells us , that in the early times of the whale fishery , ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit of the game , the people of that island erected lofty spars along the sea-coast , to which the look-outs ascended by means of nailed cleats , something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house . a few years ago this same plan was adopted by the bay whalemen of new zealand , who , upon descrying the game , gave notice to the ready-manned boats nigh the beach . but this custom has now become obsolete ; turn we then to the one proper mast-head , that of a whale-ship at sea . the three mast-heads are kept manned from sun-rise to sun-set ; the seamen taking their regular turns ( as at the helm ) , and relieving each other every two hours . in the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast-head ; nay , to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful . there you stand , a hundred feet above the silent decks , striding along the deep , as if the masts were gigantic stilts , while beneath you and between your legs , as it were , swim the hugest monsters of the sea , even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous colossus at old rhodes . there you stand , lost in the infinite series of the sea , with nothing ruffled but the waves . the tranced ship indolently rolls ; the drowsy trade winds blow ; everything resolves you into languor . for the most part , in this tropic whaling life , a sublime uneventfulness invests you ; you hear no news ; read no gazettes ; extras with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary excitements ; you hear of no domestic afflictions ; bankrupt securities ; fall of stocks ; are never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinner—for all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks , and your bill of fare is immutable .
melville	moby	the old black , not in any very high glee at having been previously roused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour , came shambling along from his galley , for , like many old blacks , there was something the matter with his knee-pans , which he did not keep well scoured like his other pans ; this old fleece , as they called him , came shuffling and limping along , assisting his step with his tongs , which , after a clumsy fashion , were made of straightened iron hoops ; this old ebony floundered along , and in obedience to the word of command , came to a dead stop on the opposite side of stubb ’ s sideboard ; when , with both hands folded before him , and resting on his two-legged cane , he bowed his arched back still further over , at the same time sideways inclining his head , so as to bring his best ear into play .
melville	moby	but what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish , is his exceeding richness . he is the great prize ox of the sea , too fat to be delicately good . look at his hump , which would be as fine eating as the buffalo ’ s ( which is esteemed a rare dish ) , were it not such a solid pyramid of fat . but the spermaceti itself , how bland and creamy that is ; like the transparent , half-jellied , white meat of a cocoanut in the third month of its growth , yet far too rich to supply a substitute for butter . nevertheless , many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into some other substance , and then partaking of it . in the long try watches of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their ship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them fry there awhile . many a good supper have i thus made .
melville	moby	as good luck would have it , they had had a whale alongside a day or two previous , and the great tackles were still aloft , and the massive curved blubber-hook , now clean and dry , was still attached to the end . this was quickly lowered to ahab , who at once comprehending it all , slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook ( it was like sitting in the fluke of an anchor , or the crotch of an apple tree ) , and then giving the word , held himself fast , and at the same time also helped to hoist his own weight , by pulling hand-over-hand upon one of the running parts of the tackle . soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks , and gently landed upon the capstan head . with his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome , the other captain advanced , and ahab , putting out his ivory leg , and crossing the ivory arm ( like two sword-fish blades ) cried out in his walrus way , “ aye , aye , hearty ! let us shake bones together ! —an arm and a leg ! —an arm that never can shrink , d ’ ye see ; and a leg that never can run . where did ’ st thou see the white whale ? —how long ago ? ”
melville	moby	“ a nice spot , ” cried flask ; “ just let me prick him there once. ” “ avast ! ” cried starbuck , “ there ’ s no need of that ! ” but humane starbuck was too late . at the instant of the dart an ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound , and goaded by it into more than sufferable anguish , the whale now spouting thick blood , with swift fury blindly darted at the craft , bespattering them and their glorying crews all over with showers of gore , capsizing flask ’ s boat and marring the bows . it was his death stroke . for , by this time , so spent was he by loss of blood , that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had made ; lay panting on his side , impotently flapped with his stumped fin , then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world ; turned up the white secrets of his belly ; lay like a log , and died . it was most piteous , that last expiring spout . as when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain , and with half-stifled melancholy gurglings the spray-column lowers and lowers to the ground—so the last long dying spout of the whale .
melville	moby	book i . ( _folio_ ) , chapter i . ( _sperm whale_ ) .—this whale , among the english of old vaguely known as the trumpa whale , and the physeter whale , and the anvil headed whale , is the present cachalot of the french , and the pottsfich of the germans , and the macrocephalus of the long words . he is , without doubt , the largest inhabitant of the globe ; the most formidable of all whales to encounter ; the most majestic in aspect ; and lastly , by far the most valuable in commerce ; he being the only creature from which that valuable substance , spermaceti , is obtained . all his peculiarities will , in many other places , be enlarged upon . it is chiefly with his name that i now have to do . philologically considered , it is absurd . some centuries ago , when the sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality , and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish ; in those days spermaceti , it would seem , was popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in england as the greenland or right whale . it was the idea also , that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the greenland whale which the first syllable of the word literally expresses . in those times , also , spermaceti was exceedingly scarce , not being used for light , but only as an ointment and medicament . it was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb . when , as i opine , in the course of time , the true nature of spermaceti became known , its original name was still retained by the dealers ; no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity . and so the appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti was really derived .
melville	moby	the whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness . at first sight , you would not think it so strong as it really is . by experiment its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds ; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons . in length , the common sperm whale-line measures something over two hundred fathoms . towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub , not like the worm-pipe of a still though , but so as to form one round , cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded “ sheaves , ” or layers of concentric spiralizations , without any hollow but the “ heart , ” or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese . as the least tangle or kink in the coiling would , in running out , infallibly take somebody ’ s arm , leg , or entire body off , the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub . some harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business , carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub , so as in the act of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists .
melville	moby	in compliance with the standing order of his commander—to report immediately , and at any one of the twenty-four hours , any decided change in the affairs of the deck , —starbuck had no sooner trimmed the yards to the breeze—however reluctantly and gloomily , —than he mechanically went below to apprise captain ahab of the circumstance .

melville	moby	in outer aspect , pip and dough-boy made a match , like a black pony and a white one , of equal developments , though of dissimilar colour , driven in one eccentric span . but while hapless dough-boy was by nature dull and torpid in his intellects , pip , though over tender-hearted , was at bottom very bright , with that pleasant , genial , jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe ; a tribe , which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer , freer relish than any other race . for blacks , the year ’ s calendar should show naught but three hundred and sixty-five fourth of julys and new year ’ s days . nor smile so , while i write that this little black was brilliant , for even blackness has its brilliancy ; behold yon lustrous ebony , panelled in king ’ s cabinets . but pip loved life , and all life ’ s peaceable securities ; so that the panic-striking business in which he had somehow unaccountably become entrapped , had most sadly blurred his brightness ; though , as ere long will be seen , what was thus temporarily subdued in him , in the end was destined to be luridly illumined by strange wild fires , that fictitiously showed him off to ten times the natural lustre with which in his native tolland county in connecticut , he had once enlivened many a fiddler ’ s frolic on the green ; and at melodious even-tide , with his gay ha-ha ! had turned the round horizon into one star-belled tambourine . so , though in the clear air of day , suspended against a blue-veined neck , the pure-watered diamond drop will healthful glow ; yet , when the cunning jeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre , he lays it against a gloomy ground , and then lights it up , not by the sun , but by some unnatural gases . then come out those fiery effulgences , infernally superb ; then the evil-blazing diamond , once the divinest symbol of the crystal skies , looks like some crown-jewel stolen from the king of hell . but let us to the story .
melville	moby	suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes ; like vices my hands grasped the shrouds ; some invisible , gracious agency preserved me ; with a shock i came back to life . and lo ! close under our lee , not forty fathoms off , a gigantic sperm whale lay rolling in the water like the capsized hull of a frigate , his broad , glossy back , of an ethiopian hue , glistening in the sun ’ s rays like a mirror . but lazily undulating in the trough of the sea , and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapory jet , the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon . but that pipe , poor whale , was thy last . as if struck by some enchanter ’ s wand , the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once started into wakefulness ; and more than a score of voices from all parts of the vessel , simultaneously with the three notes from aloft , shouted forth the accustomed cry , as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air .

melville	moby	chapter 12 . biographical . queequeg was a native of rokovoko , an island far away to the west and south . it is not down in any map ; true places never are . when a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a grass clout , followed by the nibbling goats , as if he were a green sapling ; even then , in queequeg ’ s ambitious soul , lurked a strong desire to see something more of christendom than a specimen whaler or two . his father was a high chief , a king ; his uncle a high priest ; and on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable warriors . there was excellent blood in his veins—royal stuff ; though sadly vitiated , i fear , by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his untutored youth .
melville	moby	_lay_ , indeed , thought i , and such a lay ! the seven hundred and seventy-seventh ! well , old bildad , you are determined that i , for one , shall not _lay_ up many _lays_ here below , where moth and rust do corrupt . it was an exceedingly _long lay_ that , indeed ; and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman , yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number , yet , when you come to make a _teenth_ of it , you will then see , i say , that the seven hundred and seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons ; and so i thought at the time .
melville	moby	“ ‘ you are a coward ! ’ hissed the lakeman . “ ‘ so i am , but take that. ’ the mate was in the very act of striking , when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm . he paused : and then pausing no more , made good his word , spite of steelkilt ’ s threat , whatever that might have been . the three men were then cut down , all hands were turned to , and , sullenly worked by the moody seamen , the iron pumps clanged as before .
melville	moby	but what is a _gam ? _ you might wear out your index-finger running up and down the columns of dictionaries , and never find the word . dr. johnson never attained to that erudition ; noah webster ’ s ark does not hold it . nevertheless , this same expressive word has now for many years been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born yankees . certainly , it needs a definition , and should be incorporated into the lexicon . with that view , let me learnedly define it .

melville	moby	in a moment he was standing in the boat ’ s stern , and the manilla men were springing to their oars . in vain the english captain hailed him . with back to the stranger ship , and face set like a flint to his own , ahab stood upright till alongside of the pequod .

melville	moby	moving on , i at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks , and heard a forlorn creaking in the air ; and looking up , saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it , faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray , and these words underneath— “ the spouter inn : —peter coffin . ”
melville	moby	like all sea-going ship carpenters , and more especially those belonging to whaling vessels , he was , to a certain off-handed , practical extent , alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own ; the carpenter ’ s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with wood as an auxiliary material . but , besides the application to him of the generic remark above , this carpenter of the pequod was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring in a large ship , upon a three or four years ’ voyage , in uncivilized and far-distant seas . for not to speak of his readiness in ordinary duties : —repairing stove boats , sprung spars , reforming the shape of clumsy-bladed oars , inserting bull ’ s eyes in the deck , or new tree-nails in the side planks , and other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special business ; he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes , both useful and capricious .
melville	moby	“ only this : go down with him , and get what thou wantest thyself. ” when stubb reappeared , he came with a dark flask in one hand , and a sort of tea-caddy in the other . the first contained strong spirits , and was handed to queequeg ; the second was aunt charity ’ s gift , and that was freely given to the waves .
melville	moby	“ ship ahoy ! have ye seen the white whale ? ” but as the strange captain , leaning over the pallid bulwarks , was in the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth , it somehow fell from his hand into the sea ; and the wind now rising amain , he in vain strove to make himself heard without it . meantime his ship was still increasing the distance between . while in various silent ways the seamen of the pequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first mere mention of the white whale ’ s name to another ship , ahab for a moment paused ; it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat to board the stranger , had not the threatening wind forbade . but taking advantage of his windward position , he again seized his trumpet , and knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a nantucketer and shortly bound home , he loudly hailed— “ ahoy there ! this is the pequod , bound round the world ! tell them to address all future letters to the pacific ocean ! and this time three years , if i am not at home , tell them to address them to —— ”
melville	moby	“ by the thirteenth of may our ship was ready to sail , and the next day we were out in the open sea , on our way to ochotsh . the weather was very clear and fine , but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on our fur clothing . for some days we had very little wind ; it was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up . an uncommon large whale , the body of which was larger than the ship itself , lay almost at the surface of the water , but was not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship , which was in full sail , was almost upon him , so that it was impossible to prevent its striking against him . we were thus placed in the most imminent danger , as this gigantic creature , setting up its back , raised the ship three feet at least out of the water . the masts reeled , and the sails fell altogether , while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck , concluding that we had struck upon some rock ; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity . captain d ’ wolf applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel had received any damage from the shock , but we found that very happily it had escaped entirely uninjured . ”
melville	moby	chapter 14 . nantucket . nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning ; so , after a fine run , we safely arrived in nantucket . nantucket ! take out your map and look at it . see what a real corner of the world it occupies ; how it stands there , away off shore , more lonely than the eddystone lighthouse . look at it—a mere hillock , and elbow of sand ; all beach , without a background . there is more sand there than you would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper . some gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there , they don ’ t grow naturally ; that they import canada thistles ; that they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask ; that pieces of wood in nantucket are carried about like bits of the true cross in rome ; that people there plant toadstools before their houses , to get under the shade in summer time ; that one blade of grass makes an oasis , three blades in a day ’ s walk a prairie ; that they wear quicksand shoes , something like laplander snow-shoes ; that they are so shut up , belted about , every way inclosed , surrounded , and made an utter island of by the ocean , that to their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be found adhering , as to the backs of sea turtles . but these extravaganzas only show that nantucket is no illinois .
melville	moby	well , well , my dear comrade and twin-brother , thought i , as i drew in and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea—what matters it , after all ? are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in this whaling world ? that unsounded ocean you gasp in , is life ; those sharks , your foes ; those spades , your friends ; and what between sharks and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril , poor lad .
melville	moby	“ well , that ’ s funny. ” “ and i , you , and he ; and we , ye , and they , are all bats ; and i ’ m a crow , especially when i stand a ’ top of this pine tree here . caw ! caw ! caw ! caw ! caw ! caw ! ain ’ t i a crow ? and where ’ s the scare-crow ? there he stands ; two bones stuck into a pair of old trowsers , and two more poked into the sleeves of an old jacket . ”
melville	moby	nimble as a cat , tashtego mounts aloft ; and without altering his erect posture , runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-arm , to the part where it exactly projects over the hoisted tun . he has carried with him a light tackle called a whip , consisting of only two parts , travelling through a single-sheaved block . securing this block , so that it hangs down from the yard-arm , he swings one end of the rope , till it is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck . then , hand-over-hand , down the other part , the indian drops through the air , till dexterously he lands on the summit of the head . there—still high elevated above the rest of the company , to whom he vivaciously cries—he seems some turkish muezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower . a short-handled sharp spade being sent up to him , he diligently searches for the proper place to begin breaking into the tun . in this business he proceeds very heedfully , like a treasure-hunter in some old house , sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in . by the time this cautious search is over , a stout iron-bound bucket , precisely like a well-bucket , has been attached to one end of the whip ; while the other end , being stretched across the deck , is there held by two or three alert hands . these last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the indian , to whom another person has reached up a very long pole . inserting this pole into the bucket , tashtego downward guides the bucket into the tun , till it entirely disappears ; then giving the word to the seamen at the whip , up comes the bucket again , all bubbling like a dairy-maid ’ s pail of new milk . carefully lowered from its height , the full-freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand , and quickly emptied into a large tub . then remounting aloft , it again goes through the same round until the deep cistern will yield no more . towards the end , tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder , and deeper and deeper into the tun , until some twenty feet of the pole have gone down .
melville	moby	doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring us whalemen , is this : they think that , at best , our vocation amounts to a butchering sort of business ; and that when actively engaged therein , we are surrounded by all manner of defilements . butchers we are , that is true . but butchers , also , and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been all martial commanders whom the world invariably delights to honor . and as for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business , ye shall soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown , and which , upon the whole , will triumphantly plant the sperm whale-ship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth . but even granting the charge in question to be true ; what disordered slippery decks of a whale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those battle-fields from which so many soldiers return to drink in all ladies ’ plaudits ? and if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit of the soldier ’ s profession ; let me assure ye that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery , would quickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whale ’ s vast tail , fanning into eddies the air over his head . for what are the comprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and wonders of god !
melville	moby	like most old fashioned pulpits , it was a very lofty one , and since a regular stairs to such a height would , by its long angle with the floor , seriously contract the already small area of the chapel , the architect , it seemed , had acted upon the hint of father mapple , and finished the pulpit without a stairs , substituting a perpendicular side ladder , like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea . the wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted man-ropes for this ladder , which , being itself nicely headed , and stained with a mahogany colour , the whole contrivance , considering what manner of chapel it was , seemed by no means in bad taste . halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder , and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man-ropes , father mapple cast a look upwards , and then with a truly sailor-like but still reverential dexterity , hand over hand , mounted the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel .

melville	moby	but ahab , my captain , still moves before me in all his nantucket grimness and shagginess ; and in this episode touching emperors and kings , i must not conceal that i have only to do with a poor old whale-hunter like him ; and , therefore , all outward majestical trappings and housings are denied me . oh , ahab ! what shall be grand in thee , it must needs be plucked at from the skies , and dived for in the deep , and featured in the unbodied air !
melville	moby	can you catch the expression of the sperm whale ’ s there ? it is the same he died with , only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now faded away . i think his broad brow to be full of a prairie-like placidity , born of a speculative indifference as to death . but mark the other head ’ s expression . see that amazing lower lip , pressed by accident against the vessel ’ s side , so as firmly to embrace the jaw . does not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing death ? this right whale i take to have been a stoic ; the sperm whale , a platonian , who might have taken up spinoza in his latter years .

melville	moby	but when he was helped to the deck , all eyes were fastened upon him ; as instead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the shoulder of starbuck , who had thus far been the foremost to assist him . his ivory leg had been snapped off , leaving but one short sharp splinter .
melville	moby	overhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the people on deck began to drive the coffin away , queequeg , to every one ’ s consternation , commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to him , nor was there any denying him ; seeing that , of all mortals , some dying men are the most tyrannical ; and certainly , since they will shortly trouble us so little for evermore , the poor fellows ought to be indulged .
melville	moby	and thus have these naked nantucketers , these sea hermits , issuing from their ant-hill in the sea , overrun and conquered the watery world like so many alexanders ; parcelling out among them the atlantic , pacific , and indian oceans , as the three pirate powers did poland . let america add mexico to texas , and pile cuba upon canada ; let the english overswarm all india , and hang out their blazing banner from the sun ; two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the nantucketer ’ s . for the sea is his ; he owns it , as emperors own empires ; other seamen having but a right of way through it . merchant ships are but extension bridges ; armed ones but floating forts ; even pirates and privateers , though following the sea as highwaymen the road , they but plunder other ships , other fragments of the land like themselves , without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless deep itself . the nantucketer , he alone resides and riots on the sea ; he alone , in bible language , goes down to it in ships ; to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation . _there_ is his home ; _there_ lies his business , which a noah ’ s flood would not interrupt , though it overwhelmed all the millions in china . he lives on the sea , as prairie cocks in the prairie ; he hides among the waves , he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the alps . for years he knows not the land ; so that when he comes to it at last , it smells like another world , more strangely than the moon would to an earthsman . with the landless gull , that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows ; so at nightfall , the nantucketer , out of sight of land , furls his sails , and lays him to his rest , while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales .
melville	moby	if you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view of its rear end , which is the high end , you will be struck by its resemblance to the human skull , beheld in the same situation , and from the same point of view . indeed , place this reversed skull ( scaled down to the human magnitude ) among a plate of men ’ s skulls , and you would involuntarily confound it with them ; and remarking the depressions on one part of its summit , in phrenological phrase you would say—this man had no self-esteem , and no veneration . and by those negations , considered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and power , you can best form to yourself the truest , though not the most exhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is .

melville	moby	“ ego non baptizo te in nomine patris , sed in nomine diaboli ! ” deliriously howled ahab , as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the baptismal blood . now , mustering the spare poles from below , and selecting one of hickory , with the bark still investing it , ahab fitted the end to the socket of the iron . a coil of new tow-line was then unwound , and some fathoms of it taken to the windlass , and stretched to a great tension . pressing his foot upon it , till the rope hummed like a harp-string , then eagerly bending over it , and seeing no strandings , ahab exclaimed , “ good ! and now for the seizings . ”
melville	moby	is it not a saying in every one ’ s mouth , possession is half of the law : that is , regardless of how the thing came into possession ? but often possession is the whole of the law . what are the sinews and souls of russian serfs and republican slaves but fast-fish , whereof possession is the whole of the law ? what to the rapacious landlord is the widow ’ s last mite but a fast-fish ? what is yonder undetected villain ’ s marble mansion with a door-plate for a waif ; what is that but a fast-fish ? what is the ruinous discount which mordecai , the broker , gets from poor woebegone , the bankrupt , on a loan to keep woebegone ’ s family from starvation ; what is that ruinous discount but a fast-fish ? what is the archbishop of savesoul ’ s income of £100,000 seized from the scant bread and cheese of hundreds of thousands of broken-backed laborers ( all sure of heaven without any of savesoul ’ s help ) what is that globular £100,000 but a fast-fish ? what are the duke of dunder ’ s hereditary towns and hamlets but fast-fish ? what to that redoubted harpooneer , john bull , is poor ireland , but a fast-fish ? what to that apostolic lancer , brother jonathan , is texas but a fast-fish ? and concerning all these , is not possession the whole of the law ?
melville	moby	“ no fairy fingers can have pressed the gold , but devil ’ s claws must have left their mouldings there since yesterday , ” murmured starbuck to himself , leaning against the bulwarks . “ the old man seems to read belshazzar ’ s awful writing . i have never marked the coin inspectingly . he goes below ; let me read . a dark valley between three mighty , heaven-abiding peaks , that almost seem the trinity , in some faint earthly symbol . so in this vale of death , god girds us round ; and over all our gloom , the sun of righteousness still shines a beacon and a hope . if we bend down our eyes , the dark vale shows her mouldy soil ; but if we lift them , the bright sun meets our glance half way , to cheer . yet , oh , the great sun is no fixture ; and if , at midnight , we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him , we gaze for him in vain ! this coin speaks wisely , mildly , truly , but still sadly to me . i will quit it , lest truth shake me falsely . ”

melville	moby	“ steelkilt rose , and slowly retreating round the windlass , steadily followed by the mate with his menacing hammer , deliberately repeated his intention not to obey . seeing , however , that his forbearance had not the slightest effect , by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man ; but it was to no purpose . and in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass ; when , resolved at last no longer to retreat , bethinking him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor , the lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer :
melville	moby	but stubb , he eats the whale by its own light , does he ? and that is adding insult to injury , is it ? look at your knife-handle , there , my civilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef , what is that handle made of ? —what but the bones of the brother of the very ox you are eating ? and what do you pick your teeth with , after devouring that fat goose ? with a feather of the same fowl . and with what quill did the secretary of the society for the suppression of cruelty to ganders formally indite his circulars ? it is only within the last month or two that that society passed a resolution to patronize nothing but steel pens .
melville	moby	“ steelkilt leaped on the barricade , and striding up and down there , defied the worst the pistols could do ; but gave the captain to understand distinctly , that his ( steelkilt ’ s ) death would be the signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands . fearing in his heart lest this might prove but too true , the captain a little desisted , but still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty .
melville	moby	faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment , the old negro muttered , “ best cooked ’ teak i eber taste ; joosy , berry joosy. ” “ cook , ” said stubb , squaring himself once more ; “ do you belong to the church ? ”
melville	moby	but why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject ? speak out ! you have seen him spout ; then declare what the spout is ; can you not tell water from air ? my dear sir , in this world it is not so easy to settle these plain things . i have ever found your plain things the knottiest of all . and as for this whale spout , you might almost stand in it , and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely .
melville	moby	over his ivory-inlaid table , ahab presided like a mute , maned sea-lion on the white coral beach , surrounded by his warlike but still deferential cubs . in his own proper turn , each officer waited to be served . they were as little children before ahab ; and yet , in ahab , there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance . with one mind , their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man ’ s knife , as he carved the chief dish before him . i do not suppose that for the world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation , even upon so neutral a topic as the weather . no ! and when reaching out his knife and fork , between which the slice of beef was locked , ahab thereby motioned starbuck ’ s plate towards him , the mate received his meat as though receiving alms ; and cut it tenderly ; and a little started if , perchance , the knife grazed against the plate ; and chewed it noiselessly ; and swallowed it , not without circumspection . for , like the coronation banquet at frankfort , where the german emperor profoundly dines with the seven imperial electors , so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals , eaten in awful silence ; and yet at table old ahab forbade not conversation ; only he himself was dumb . what a relief it was to choking stubb , when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below . and poor little flask , he was the youngest son , and little boy of this weary family party . his were the shinbones of the saline beef ; his would have been the drumsticks . for flask to have presumed to help himself , this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree . had he helped himself at that table , doubtless , never more would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world ; nevertheless , strange to say , ahab never forbade him . and had flask helped himself , the chances were ahab had never so much as noticed it . least of all , did flask presume to help himself to butter . whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him , on account of its clotting his clear , sunny complexion ; or whether he deemed that , on so long a voyage in such marketless waters , butter was at a premium , and therefore was not for him , a subaltern ; however it was , flask , alas ! was a butterless man !
melville	moby	and thus , through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea , among waves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture , moby dick moved on , still withholding from sight the full terrors of his submerged trunk , entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw . but soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water ; for an instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch , like virginia ’ s natural bridge , and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air , the grand god revealed himself , sounded , and went out of sight . hoveringly halting , and dipping on the wing , the white sea-fowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left .
melville	moby	“ ‘ stern all ! ’ exclaimed the mate , as upon turning his head , he saw the distended jaws of a large sperm whale close to the head of the boat , threatening it with instant destruction ; — ‘ stern all , for your lives ! ’ ” —_wharton the whale killer_ .

melville	moby	removing the fire-board from the front of the try-works , the bare masonry of that side is exposed , penetrated by the two iron mouths of the furnaces , directly underneath the pots . these mouths are fitted with heavy doors of iron . the intense heat of the fire is prevented from communicating itself to the deck , by means of a shallow reservoir extending under the entire inclosed surface of the works . by a tunnel inserted at the rear , this reservoir is kept replenished with water as fast as it evaporates . there are no external chimneys ; they open direct from the rear wall . and here let us go back for a moment .
melville	moby	silently obeying the order , the three harpooneers now stood with the detached iron part of their harpoons , some three feet long , held , barbs up , before him . “ stab me not with that keen steel ! cant them ; cant them over ! know ye not the goblet end ? turn up the socket ! so , so ; now , ye cup-bearers , advance . the irons ! take them ; hold them while i fill ! ” forthwith , slowly going from one officer to the other , he brimmed the harpoon sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter .

melville	moby	chapter 43 . hark ! “ hist ! did you hear that noise , cabaco ? ” it was the middle-watch : a fair moonlight ; the seamen were standing in a cordon , extending from one of the fresh-water butts in the waist , to the scuttle-butt near the taffrail . in this manner , they passed the buckets to fill the scuttle-butt . standing , for the most part , on the hallowed precincts of the quarter-deck , they were careful not to speak or rustle their feet . from hand to hand , the buckets went in the deepest silence , only broken by the occasional flap of a sail , and the steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel .
melville	moby	with a fair , fresh wind , the pequod was now drawing nigh to these straits ; ahab purposing to pass through them into the javan sea , and thence , cruising northwards , over waters known to be frequented here and there by the sperm whale , sweep inshore by the philippine islands , and gain the far coast of japan , in time for the great whaling season there . by these means , the circumnavigating pequod would sweep almost all the known sperm whale cruising grounds of the world , previous to descending upon the line in the pacific ; where ahab , though everywhere else foiled in his pursuit , firmly counted upon giving battle to moby dick , in the sea he was most known to frequent ; and at a season when he might most reasonably be presumed to be haunting it .
melville	moby	* the whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best steel ; is about the bigness of a man ’ s spread hand ; and in general shape , corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named ; only its sides are perfectly flat , and its upper end considerably narrower than the lower . this weapon is always kept as sharp as possible ; and when being used is occasionally honed , just like a razor . in its socket , a stiff pole , from twenty to thirty feet long , is inserted for a handle .
melville	moby	i know of only four published outlines of the great sperm whale ; colnett ’ s , huggins ’ s , frederick cuvier ’ s , and beale ’ s . in the previous chapter colnett and cuvier have been referred to . huggins ’ s is far better than theirs ; but , by great odds , beale ’ s is the best . all beale ’ s drawings of this whale are good , excepting the middle figure in the picture of three whales in various attitudes , capping his second chapter . his frontispiece , boats attacking sperm whales , though no doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men , is admirably correct and life-like in its general effect . some of the sperm whale drawings in j. ross browne are pretty correct in contour ; but they are wretchedly engraved . that is not his fault though .
melville	moby	deliberately standing before the binnacle , and eyeing the transpointed compasses , the old man , with the sharp of his extended hand , now took the precise bearing of the sun , and satisfied that the needles were exactly inverted , shouted out his orders for the ship ’ s course to be changed accordingly . the yards were hard up ; and once more the pequod thrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind , for the supposed fair one had only been juggling her .
melville	moby	“ mr . stubb , ” said i , turning to that worthy , who , buttoned up in his oil-jacket , was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain ; “ mr . stubb , i think i have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met , our chief mate , mr. starbuck , is by far the most careful and prudent . i suppose then , that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy squall is the height of a whaleman ’ s discretion ? ”
melville	moby	at the first faintest glimmering of the dawn , his iron voice was heard from aft , — “ man the mast-heads ! ” —and all through the day , till after sunset and after twilight , the same voice every hour , at the striking of the helmsman ’ s bell , was heard— “ what d ’ ye see ? —sharp ! sharp ! ”
melville	moby	at length , when the last pint is casked , and all is cool , then the great hatchways are unsealed , the bowels of the ship are thrown open , and down go the casks to their final rest in the sea . this done , the hatches are replaced , and hermetically closed , like a closet walled up .
melville	moby	at last , stepping on board the pequod , we found everything in profound quiet , not a soul moving . the cabin entrance was locked within ; the hatches were all on , and lumbered with coils of rigging . going forward to the forecastle , we found the slide of the scuttle open . seeing a light , we went down , and found only an old rigger there , wrapped in a tattered pea-jacket . he was thrown at whole length upon two chests , his face downwards and inclosed in his folded arms . the profoundest slumber slept upon him .
melville	moby	as the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and dead feet , a sneering triumph that seemed meant for ahab , and a fatalistic despair that seemed meant for himself—these passed over the mute , motionless parsee ’ s face . unobserved he rose and glided away ; while , awestruck by the aspect of their commander , the seamen clustered together on the forecastle , till ahab , troubledly pacing the deck , shouted out— “ to the braces ! up helm ! —square in ! ”
melville	moby	perseus , st. george , hercules , jonah , and vishnoo ! there ’ s a member-roll for you ! what club but the whaleman ’ s can head off like that ? chapter 83 . jonah historically regarded . reference was made to the historical story of jonah and the whale in the preceding chapter . now some nantucketers rather distrust this historical story of jonah and the whale . but then there were some sceptical greeks and romans , who , standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times , equally doubted the story of hercules and the whale , and arion and the dolphin ; and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less facts , for all that .
melville	moby	being the savage ’ s bowsman , that is , the person who pulled the bow-oar in his boat ( the second one from forward ) , it was my cheerful duty to attend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead whale ’ s back . you have seen italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by a long cord . just so , from the ship ’ s steep side , did i hold queequeg down there in the sea , by what is technically called in the fishery a monkey-rope , attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his waist .
melville	moby	when the last nail was driven , and the lid duly planed and fitted , he lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it , inquiring whether they were ready for it yet in that direction .
melville	moby	upon entering the place i found a number of young seamen gathered about a table , examining by a dim light divers specimens of _skrimshander_ . i sought the landlord , and telling him i desired to be accommodated with a room , received for answer that his house was full—not a bed unoccupied . “ but avast , ” he added , tapping his forehead , “ you haint no objections to sharing a harpooneer ’ s blanket , have ye ? i s ’ pose you are goin ’ a-whalin ’ , so you ’ d better get used to that sort of thing . ”
melville	moby	“ sink him ! i never look at him at all ; but if ever i get a chance of a dark night , and he standing hard by the bulwarks , and no one by ; look down there , flask ” —pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both hands— “ aye , will i ! flask , i take that fedallah to be the devil in disguise . do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been stowed away on board ship ? he ’ s the devil , i say . the reason why you don ’ t see his tail , is because he tucks it up out of sight ; he carries it coiled away in his pocket , i guess . blast him ! now that i think of it , he ’ s always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots . ”
melville	moby	but how ? genius in the sperm whale ? has the sperm whale ever written a book , spoken a speech ? no , his great genius is declared in his doing nothing particular to prove it . it is moreover declared in his pyramidical silence . and this reminds me that had the great sperm whale been known to the young orient world , he would have been deified by their child-magian thoughts . they deified the crocodile of the nile , because the crocodile is tongueless ; and the sperm whale has no tongue , or at least it is so exceedingly small , as to be incapable of protrusion . if hereafter any highly cultured , poetical nation shall lure back to their birth-right , the merry may-day gods of old ; and livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky ; in the now unhaunted hill ; then be sure , exalted to jove ’ s high seat , the great sperm whale shall lord it .

melville	moby	in addition to those fine engravings from garnery , there are two other french engravings worthy of note , by some one who subscribes himself “ h . durand. ” one of them , though not precisely adapted to our present purpose , nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts . it is a quiet noon-scene among the isles of the pacific ; a french whaler anchored , inshore , in a calm , and lazily taking water on board ; the loosened sails of the ship , and the long leaves of the palms in the background , both drooping together in the breezeless air . the effect is very fine , when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few aspects of oriental repose . the other engraving is quite a different affair : the ship hove-to upon the open sea , and in the very heart of the leviathanic life , with a right whale alongside ; the vessel ( in the act of cutting-in ) hove over to the monster as if to a quay ; and a boat , hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity , is about giving chase to whales in the distance . the harpoons and lances lie levelled for use ; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole ; while from a sudden roll of the sea , the little craft stands half-erect out of the water , like a rearing horse . from the ship , the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke over a village of smithies ; and to windward , a black cloud , rising up with earnest of squalls and rains , seems to quicken the activity of the excited seamen .
melville	moby	look not too long in the face of the fire , o man ! never dream with thy hand on the helm ! turn not thy back to the compass ; accept the first hint of the hitching tiller ; believe not the artificial fire , when its redness makes all things look ghastly . to-morrow , in the natural sun , the skies will be bright ; those who glared like devils in the forking flames , the morn will show in far other , at least gentler , relief ; the glorious , golden , glad sun , the only true lamp—all others but liars !

melville	moby	chapter 109 . ahab and starbuck in the cabin . according to usage they were pumping the ship next morning ; and lo ! no inconsiderable oil came up with the water ; the casks below must have sprung a bad leak . much concern was shown ; and starbuck went down into the cabin to report this unfavourable affair . *
melville	moby	“ all ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a white whale . look ye ! d ’ ye see this spanish ounce of gold ? ” —holding up a broad bright coin to the sun— “ it is a sixteen dollar piece , men . d ’ ye see it ? mr. starbuck , hand me yon top-maul . ”
melville	moby	as was afterwards learned , the bachelor had met with the most surprising success ; all the more wonderful , for that while cruising in the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a single fish . not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to make room for the far more valuable sperm , but additional supplemental casks had been bartered for , from the ships she had met ; and these were stowed along the deck , and in the captain ’ s and officers ’ state-rooms . even the cabin table itself had been knocked into kindling-wood ; and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an oil-butt , lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece . in the forecastle , the sailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests , and filled them ; it was humorously added , that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler , and filled it ; that the steward had plugged his spare coffee-pot and filled it ; that the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filled them ; that indeed everything was filled with sperm , except the captain ’ s pantaloons pockets , and those he reserved to thrust his hands into , in self-complacent testimony of his entire satisfaction .
melville	moby	“ hold hard ! ” snap ! the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon ; the tugging log was gone . “ i crush the quadrant , the thunder turns the needles , and now the mad sea parts the log-line . but ahab can mend all . haul in here , tahitian ; reel up , manxman . and look ye , let the carpenter make another log , and mend thou the line . see to it . ”
melville	moby	* this reminds us that the right whale really has a sort of whisker , or rather a moustache , consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw . sometimes these tufts impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn countenance .

melville	moby	it has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole ; if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water , then i opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems obliterated in him ; for the only thing about him that at all answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole ; and being so clogged with two elements , it could not be expected to have the power of smelling . but owing to the mystery of the spout—whether it be water or whether it be vapor—no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on this head . sure it is , nevertheless , that the sperm whale has no proper olfactories . but what does he want of them ? no roses , no violets , no cologne-water in the sea .
melville	moby	in another place—p . 45 , —he speaks of “ _the mysterious and mortal attack of the animal_. ” secondly : the ship union , also of nantucket , was in the year 1807 totally lost off the azores by a similar onset , but the authentic particulars of this catastrophe i have never chanced to encounter , though from the whale hunters i have now and then heard casual allusions to it .
melville	moby	“ come , come , captain bildad ; stop palavering , —away ! ” and with that , peleg hurried him over the side , and both dropt into the boat . ship and boat diverged ; the cold , damp night breeze blew between ; a screaming gull flew overhead ; the two hulls wildly rolled ; we gave three heavy-hearted cheers , and blindly plunged like fate into the lone atlantic .
melville	moby	he dropped and fell away from himself for a moment ; then lifting his face to them again , showed a deep joy in his eyes , as he cried out with a heavenly enthusiasm , — “ but oh ! shipmates ! on the starboard hand of every woe , there is a sure delight ; and higher the top of that delight , than the bottom of the woe is deep . is not the main-truck higher than the kelson is low ? delight is to him—a far , far upward , and inward delight—who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth , ever stands forth his own inexorable self . delight is to him whose strong arms yet support him , when the ship of this base treacherous world has gone down beneath him . delight is to him , who gives no quarter in the truth , and kills , burns , and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the robes of senators and judges . delight , —top-gallant delight is to him , who acknowledges no law or lord , but the lord his god , and is only a patriot to heaven . delight is to him , whom all the waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this sure keel of the ages . and eternal delight and deliciousness will be his , who coming to lay him down , can say with his final breath—o father ! —chiefly known to me by thy rod—mortal or immortal , here i die . i have striven to be thine , more than to be this world ’ s , or mine own . yet this is nothing : i leave eternity to thee ; for what is man that he should live out the lifetime of his god ? ”
melville	moby	extracts . ( supplied by a sub-sub-librarian ) . it will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of a poor devil of a sub-sub appears to have gone through the long vaticans and street-stalls of the earth , picking up whatever random allusions to whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever , sacred or profane . therefore you must not , in every case at least , take the higgledy-piggledy whale statements , however authentic , in these extracts , for veritable gospel cetology . far from it . as touching the ancient authors generally , as well as the poets here appearing , these extracts are solely valuable or entertaining , as affording a glancing bird ’ s eye view of what has been promiscuously said , thought , fancied , and sung of leviathan , by many nations and generations , including our own .
melville	moby	chapter 33 . the specksnyder . concerning the officers of the whale-craft , this seems as good a place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board , arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers , a class unknown of course in any other marine than the whale-fleet .
melville	moby	when in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in the rigging , which chances to afford no foothold , the sailor at sea is hoisted up to that spot , and sustained there by the rope ; under these circumstances , its fastened end on deck is always given in strict charge to some one man who has the special watch of it . because in such a wilderness of running rigging , whose various different relations aloft can not always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at the deck ; and when the deck-ends of these ropes are being every few minutes cast down from the fastenings , it would be but a natural fatality , if , unprovided with a constant watchman , the hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea . so ahab ’ s proceedings in this matter were not unusual ; the only strange thing about them seemed to be , that starbuck , almost the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree approaching to decision—one of those too , whose faithfulness on the look-out he had seemed to doubt somewhat ; —it was strange , that this was the very man he should select for his watchman ; freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person ’ s hands .

melville	moby	“ man the capstan ! blood and thunder ! —jump ! ” —was the next command , and the crew sprang for the handspikes . now in getting under weigh , the station generally occupied by the pilot is the forward part of the ship . and here bildad , who , with peleg , be it known , in addition to his other officers , was one of the licensed pilots of the port—he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in order to save the nantucket pilot-fee to all the ships he was concerned in , for he never piloted any other craft—bildad , i say , might now be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching anchor , and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody , to cheer the hands at the windlass , who roared forth some sort of a chorus about the girls in booble alley , with hearty good will . nevertheless , not three days previous , bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed on board the pequod , particularly in getting under weigh ; and charity , his sister , had placed a small choice copy of watts in each seaman ’ s berth .

melville	moby	“ no need of profane words , however great the hurry , peleg , ” said bildad , “ but away with thee , friend starbuck , and do our bidding. ” how now ! here upon the very point of starting for the voyage , captain peleg and captain bildad were going it with a high hand on the quarter-deck , just as if they were to be joint-commanders at sea , as well as to all appearances in port . and , as for captain ahab , no sign of him was yet to be seen ; only , they said he was in the cabin . but then , the idea was , that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the ship under weigh , and steering her well out to sea . indeed , as that was not at all his proper business , but the pilot ’ s ; and as he was not yet completely recovered—so they said—therefore , captain ahab stayed below . and all this seemed natural enough ; especially as in the merchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up the anchor , but remain over the cabin table , having a farewell merry-making with their shore friends , before they quit the ship for good with the pilot .

melville	moby	that great america on the other side of the sphere , australia , was given to the enlightened world by the whaleman . after its first blunder-born discovery by a dutchman , all other ships long shunned those shores as pestiferously barbarous ; but the whale-ship touched there . the whale-ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony . moreover , in the infancy of the first australian settlement , the emigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the whale-ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters . the uncounted isles of all polynesia confess the same truth , and do commercial homage to the whale-ship , that cleared the way for the missionary and the merchant , and in many cases carried the primitive missionaries to their first destinations . if that double-bolted land , japan , is ever to become hospitable , it is the whale-ship alone to whom the credit will be due ; for already she is on the threshold .
melville	moby	it was a wondrous sight . the wood was green as mosses of the icy glen ; the trees stood high and haughty , feeling their living sap ; the industrious earth beneath was as a weaver ’ s loom , with a gorgeous carpet on it , whereof the ground-vine tendrils formed the warp and woof , and the living flowers the figures . all the trees , with all their laden branches ; all the shrubs , and ferns , and grasses ; the message-carrying air ; all these unceasingly were active . through the lacings of the leaves , the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied verdure . oh , busy weaver ! unseen weaver ! —pause ! —one word ! —whither flows the fabric ? what palace may it deck ? wherefore all these ceaseless toilings ? speak , weaver ! —stay thy hand ! —but one single word with thee ! nay—the shuttle flies—the figures float from forth the loom ; the freshet-rushing carpet for ever slides away . the weaver-god , he weaves ; and by that weaving is he deafened , that he hears no mortal voice ; and by that humming , we , too , who look on the loom are deafened ; and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through it . for even so it is in all material factories . the spoken words that are inaudible among the flying spindles ; those same words are plainly heard without the walls , bursting from the opened casements . thereby have villainies been detected . ah , mortal ! then , be heedful ; for so , in all this din of the great world ’ s loom , thy subtlest thinkings may be overheard afar .

melville	moby	“ knife ? aye , aye , ” cried queequeg , and seizing the carpenter ’ s heavy hatchet , he leaned out of a porthole , and steel to iron , began slashing at the largest fluke-chains . but a few strokes , full of sparks , were given , when the exceeding strain effected the rest . with a terrific snap , every fastening went adrift ; the ship righted , the carcase sank .
melville	moby	“ and when thou art so gone before—if that ever befall—then ere i can follow , thou must still appear to me , to pilot me still ? —was it not so ? well , then , did i believe all ye say , oh my pilot ! i have here two pledges that i shall yet slay moby dick and survive it . ”
melville	moby	oh ! many are the fin-backs , and many are the dericks , my friend . chapter 82 . the honor and glory of whaling . there are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the true method .
melville	moby	i pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this . father mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity , that i could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of the stage . no , thought i , there must be some sober reason for this thing ; furthermore , it must symbolize something unseen . can it be , then , that by that act of physical isolation , he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time , from all outward worldly ties and connexions ? yes , for replenished with the meat and wine of the word , to the faithful man of god , this pulpit , i see , is a self-containing stronghold—a lofty ehrenbreitstein , with a perennial well of water within the walls .
melville	moby	at this instant , while daggoo , on the summit of the head , was clearing the whip—which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles—a sharp cracking noise was heard ; and to the unspeakable horror of all , one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out , and with a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung , till the drunk ship reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg . the one remaining hook , upon which the entire strain now depended , seemed every instant to be on the point of giving way ; an event still more likely from the violent motions of the head .
melville	moby	it was a nantucket ship , the bachelor , which had just wedged in her last cask of oil , and bolted down her bursting hatches ; and now , in glad holiday apparel , was joyously , though somewhat vain-gloriously , sailing round among the widely-separated ships on the ground , previous to pointing her prow for home .
melville	moby	gaining the more open water , the bracing breeze waxed fresh ; the little moss tossed the quick foam from her bows , as a young colt his snortings . how i snuffed that tartar air ! —how i spurned that turnpike earth ! —that common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and hoofs ; and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will permit no records .
melville	moby	starbuck was no crusader after perils ; in him courage was not a sentiment ; but a thing simply useful to him , and always at hand upon all mortally practical occasions . besides , he thought , perhaps , that in this business of whaling , courage was one of the great staple outfits of the ship , like her beef and her bread , and not to be foolishly wasted . wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after sun-down ; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting him . for , thought starbuck , i am here in this critical ocean to kill whales for my living , and not to be killed by them for theirs ; and that hundreds of men had been so killed starbuck well knew . what doom was his own father ’ s ? where , in the bottomless deeps , could he find the torn limbs of his brother ?
melville	moby	now , when i say that i am in the habit of going to sea whenever i begin to grow hazy about the eyes , and begin to be over conscious of my lungs , i do not mean to have it inferred that i ever go to sea as a passenger . for to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse , and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it . besides , passengers get sea-sick—grow quarrelsome—don ’ t sleep of nights—do not enjoy themselves much , as a general thing ; —no , i never go as a passenger ; nor , though i am something of a salt , do i ever go to sea as a commodore , or a captain , or a cook . i abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them . for my part , i abominate all honorable respectable toils , trials , and tribulations of every kind whatsoever . it is quite as much as i can do to take care of myself , without taking care of ships , barques , brigs , schooners , and what not . and as for going as cook , —though i confess there is considerable glory in that , a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board—yet , somehow , i never fancied broiling fowls ; —though once broiled , judiciously buttered , and judgmatically salted and peppered , there is no one who will speak more respectfully , not to say reverentially , of a broiled fowl than i will . it is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse , that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids .
melville	moby	“ what in the devil ’ s name do you want here ? ” roared the guernseyman , flying into a sudden passion . “ oh ! keep cool—cool ? yes , that ’ s the word ! why don ’ t you pack those whales in ice while you ’ re working at ’ em ? but joking aside , though ; do you know , rose-bud , that it ’ s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of such whales ? as for that dried up one , there , he hasn ’ t a gill in his whole carcase . ”
melville	moby	“ cook , ” said stubb , rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his mouth , “ don ’ t you think this steak is rather overdone ? you ’ ve been beating this steak too much , cook ; it ’ s too tender . don ’ t i always say that to be good , a whale-steak must be tough ? there are those sharks now over the side , don ’ t you see they prefer it tough and rare ? what a shindy they are kicking up ! cook , go and talk to ’ em ; tell ’ em they are welcome to help themselves civilly , and in moderation , but they must keep quiet . blast me , if i can hear my own voice . away , cook , and deliver my message . here , take this lantern , ” snatching one from his sideboard ; “ now then , go and preach to ’ em ! ”
melville	moby	how vain and foolish , then , thought i , for timid untravelled man to try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale , by merely poring over his dead attenuated skeleton , stretched in this peaceful wood . no . only in the heart of quickest perils ; only when within the eddyings of his angry flukes ; only on the profound unbounded sea , can the fully invested whale be truly and livingly found out .
melville	moby	there are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living sperm whale before you , and at the same time , in the remotest degree succeed in the attempt . those books are beale ’ s and bennett ’ s ; both in their time surgeons to english south-sea whale-ships , and both exact and reliable men . the original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily small ; but so far as it goes , it is of excellent quality , though mostly confined to scientific description . as yet , however , the sperm whale , scientific or poetic , lives not complete in any literature . far above all other hunted whales , his is an unwritten life .

melville	moby	“ think , think of the fevers , yellow and bilious ! beware of the horrible plague ! ” “ gabriel ! gabriel ! ” cried captain mayhew ; “ thou must either— ” but that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead , and its seethings drowned all speech .
melville	moby	the central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping it ; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it , when , always , when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout , he is in a prodigious commotion , the water cascading all around him . and if at such times you should think that you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout , how do you know that they are not merely condensed from its vapor ; or how do you know that they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole fissure , which is countersunk into the summit of the whale ’ s head ? for even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm , with his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary ’ s in the desert ; even then , the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head , as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain .
melville	moby	even as it was , i thought something of slipping out of the window , but it was the second floor back . i am no coward , but what to make of this head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension . ignorance is the parent of fear , and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger , i confess i was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night . in fact , i was so afraid of him that i was not game enough just then to address him , and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him .
melville	moby	as the boats now more closely surrounded him , the whole upper part of his form , with much of it that is ordinarily submerged , was plainly revealed . his eyes , or rather the places where his eyes had been , were beheld . as strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of the noblest oaks when prostrate , so from the points which the whale ’ s eyes had once occupied , now protruded blind bulbs , horribly pitiable to see . but pity there was none . for all his old age , and his one arm , and his blind eyes , he must die the death and be murdered , in order to light the gay bridals and other merry-makings of men , and also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all . still rolling in his blood , at last he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance , the size of a bushel , low down on the flank .
melville	moby	there is another substance , and a very singular one , which turns up in the course of this business , but which i feel it to be very puzzling adequately to describe . it is called slobgollion ; an appellation original with the whalemen , and even so is the nature of the substance . it is an ineffably oozy , stringy affair , most frequently found in the tubs of sperm , after a prolonged squeezing , and subsequent decanting . i hold it to be the wondrously thin , ruptured membranes of the case , coalescing .
melville	moby	“ but i do not mean anything , sir . i do as i do. ” “ the gods again . hark ye , dost thou not ever sing working about a coffin ? the titans , they say , hummed snatches when chipping out the craters for volcanoes ; and the grave-digger in the play sings , spade in hand . dost thou never ? ”
melville	moby	as with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again , starbuck still gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk , with a wild voice exclaimed— “ almost rather had i seen moby dick and fought him , than to have seen thee , thou white ghost ! ”
melville	moby	chapter 81 . the pequod meets the virgin . the predestinated day arrived , and we duly met the ship jungfrau , derick de deer , master , of bremen . at one time the greatest whaling people in the world , the dutch and germans are now among the least ; but here and there at very wide intervals of latitude and longitude , you still occasionally meet with their flag in the pacific .
melville	moby	i will now refer you to langsdorff ’ s voyages for a little circumstance in point , peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof . langsdorff , you must know by the way , was attached to the russian admiral krusenstern ’ s famous discovery expedition in the beginning of the present century . captain langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter :
melville	moby	though stubb did not understand the _bouton_ part of the inscription , yet the word _rose_ , and the bulbous figure-head put together , sufficiently explained the whole to him . “ a wooden rose-bud , eh ? ” he cried with his hand to his nose , “ that will do very well ; but how like all creation it smells ! ”
melville	moby	chapter 85 . the fountain . that for six thousand years—and no one knows how many millions of ages before—the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea , and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep , as with so many sprinkling or mistifying pots ; and that for some centuries back , thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the whale , watching these sprinklings and spoutings—that all this should be , and yet , that down to this blessed minute ( fifteen and a quarter minutes past one o ’ clock p.m. of this sixteenth day of december , a.d. 1851 ) , it should still remain a problem , whether these spoutings are , after all , really water , or nothing but vapor—this is surely a noteworthy thing .
melville	moby	regarding the sperm whale ’ s head as a solid oblong , you may , on an inclined plane , sideways divide it into two quoins , * whereof the lower is the bony structure , forming the cranium and jaws , and the upper an unctuous mass wholly free from bones ; its broad forward end forming the expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale . at the middle of the forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin , and then you have two almost equal parts , which before were naturally divided by an internal wall of a thick tendinous substance .
melville	moby	so fare thee well , poor devil of a sub-sub , whose commentator i am . thou belongest to that hopeless , sallow tribe which no wine of this world will ever warm ; and for whom even pale sherry would be too rosy-strong ; but with whom one sometimes loves to sit , and feel poor-devilish , too ; and grow convivial upon tears ; and say to them bluntly , with full eyes and empty glasses , and in not altogether unpleasant sadness—give it up , sub-subs ! for by how much the more pains ye take to please the world , by so much the more shall ye for ever go thankless ! would that i could clear out hampton court and the tuileries for ye ! but gulp down your tears and hie aloft to the royal-mast with your hearts ; for your friends who have gone before are clearing out the seven-storied heavens , and making refugees of long-pampered gabriel , michael , and raphael , against your coming . here ye strike but splintered hearts together—there , ye shall strike unsplinterable glasses !
melville	moby	but that night , in particular , a strange ( and ever since inexplicable ) thing occurred to me . starting from a brief standing sleep , i was horribly conscious of something fatally wrong . the jaw-bone tiller smote my side , which leaned against it ; in my ears was the low hum of sails , just beginning to shake in the wind ; i thought my eyes were open ; i was half conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and mechanically stretching them still further apart . but , spite of all this , i could see no compass before me to steer by ; though it seemed but a minute since i had been watching the card , by the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it . nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom , now and then made ghastly by flashes of redness . uppermost was the impression , that whatever swift , rushing thing i stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern . a stark , bewildered feeling , as of death , came over me . convulsively my hands grasped the tiller , but with the crazy conceit that the tiller was , somehow , in some enchanted way , inverted . my god ! what is the matter with me ? thought i . lo ! in my brief sleep i had turned myself about , and was fronting the ship ’ s stern , with my back to her prow and the compass . in an instant i faced back , just in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into the wind , and very probably capsizing her . how glad and how grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night , and the fatal contingency of being brought by the lee !
melville	moby	ripplingly withdrawing from his prey , moby dick now lay at a little distance , vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the billows ; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body ; so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose—some twenty or more feet out of the water—the now rising swells , with all their confluent waves , dazzlingly broke against it ; vindictively tossing their shivered spray still higher into the air . * so , in a gale , the but half baffled channel billows only recoil from the base of the eddystone , triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scud .
melville	moby	“ didn ’ t i tell you so ? ” said flask ; “ yes , you ’ ll soon see this right whale ’ s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti ’ s. ” in good time , flask ’ s saying proved true . as before , the pequod steeply leaned over towards the sperm whale ’ s head , now , by the counterpoise of both heads , she regained her even keel ; though sorely strained , you may well believe . so , when on one side you hoist in locke ’ s head , you go over that way ; but now , on the other side , hoist in kant ’ s and you come back again ; but in very poor plight . thus , some minds for ever keep trimming boat . oh , ye foolish ! throw all these thunder-heads overboard , and then you will float light and right .
melville	moby	there are forty and odd vertebræ in all , which in the skeleton are not locked together . they mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a gothic spire , forming solid courses of heavy masonry . the largest , a middle one , is in width something less than three feet , and in depth more than four . the smallest , where the spine tapers away into the tail , is only two inches in width , and looks something like a white billiard-ball . i was told that there were still smaller ones , but they had been lost by some little cannibal urchins , the priest ’ s children , who had stolen them to play marbles with . thus we see how that the spine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into simple child ’ s play .
melville	moby	“ ‘ say ye so ? then see how ye frighten me ’ —and the captain drew off with the rope to strike . “ ‘ best not , ’ hissed the lakeman . “ ‘ but i must , ’ —and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke .
melville	moby	look now at stubb ; a man who from his humorous , deliberate coolness and equanimity in the direst emergencies , was specially qualified to excel in pitchpoling . look at him ; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the flying boat ; wrapt in fleecy foam , the towing whale is forty feet ahead . handling the long lance lightly , glancing twice or thrice along its length to see if it be exactly straight , stubb whistlingly gathers up the coil of the warp in one hand , so as to secure its free end in his grasp , leaving the rest unobstructed . then holding the lance full before his waistband ’ s middle , he levels it at the whale ; when , covering him with it , he steadily depresses the butt-end in his hand , thereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon his palm , fifteen feet in the air . he minds you somewhat of a juggler , balancing a long staff on his chin . next moment with a rapid , nameless impulse , in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming distance , and quivers in the life spot of the whale . instead of sparkling water , he now spouts red blood .
melville	moby	“ and what do ye next , men ? ” “ lower away , and after him ! ” “ and what tune is it ye pull to , men ? ” “ a dead whale or a stove boat ! ” more and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving , grew the countenance of the old man at every shout ; while the mariners began to gaze curiously at each other , as if marvelling how it was that they themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions .
melville	moby	“ quitting the pump at last , with the rest of his band , the lakeman went forward all panting , and sat himself down on the windlass ; his face fiery red , his eyes bloodshot , and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow . now what cozening fiend it was , gentlemen , that possessed radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state , i know not ; but so it happened . intolerably striding along the deck , the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks , and also a shovel , and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large .
melville	moby	finally : it was stated at the outset , that this system would not be here , and at once , perfected . you can not but plainly see that i have kept my word . but i now leave my cetological system standing thus unfinished , even as the great cathedral of cologne was left , with the crane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower . for small erections may be finished by their first architects ; grand ones , true ones , ever leave the copestone to posterity . god keep me from ever completing anything . this whole book is but a draught—nay , but the draught of a draught . oh , time , strength , cash , and patience !
melville	moby	but thou sayest , methinks that white-lead chapter about whiteness is but a white flag hung out from a craven soul ; thou surrenderest to a hypo , ishmael . tell me , why this strong young colt , foaled in some peaceful valley of vermont , far removed from all beasts of prey—why is it that upon the sunniest day , if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him , so that he can not even see it , but only smells its wild animal muskiness—why will he start , snort , and with bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies of affright ? there is no remembrance in him of any gorings of wild creatures in his green northern home , so that the strange muskiness he smells can not recall to him anything associated with the experience of former perils ; for what knows he , this new england colt , of the black bisons of distant oregon ?
melville	moby	he commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat , a very tall one , by the by , and then—still minus his trowsers—he hunted up his boots . what under the heavens he did it for , i can not tell , but his next movement was to crush himself—boots in hand , and hat on—under the bed ; when , from sundry violent gaspings and strainings , i inferred he was hard at work booting himself ; though by no law of propriety that i ever heard of , is any man required to be private when putting on his boots . but queequeg , do you see , was a creature in the transition stage—neither caterpillar nor butterfly . he was just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners . his education was not yet completed . he was an undergraduate . if he had not been a small degree civilized , he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all ; but then , if he had not been still a savage , he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on . at last , he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes , and began creaking and limping about the room , as if , not being much accustomed to boots , his pair of damp , wrinkled cowhide ones—probably not made to order either—rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning .
melville	moby	there ’ s a most doleful and most mocking funeral ! the sea-vultures all in pious mourning , the air-sharks all punctiliously in black or speckled . in life but few of them would have helped the whale , i ween , if peradventure he had needed it ; but upon the banquet of his funeral they most piously do pounce . oh , horrible vultureism of earth ! from which not the mightiest whale is free .
melville	moby	of all the wondrous devices and dexterities , the sleights of hand and countless subtleties , to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced , none exceed that fine manœuvre with the lance called pitchpoling . small sword , or broad sword , in all its exercises boasts nothing like it . it is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale ; its grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is accurately darted from a violently rocking , jerking boat , under extreme headway . steel and wood included , the entire spear is some ten or twelve feet in length ; the staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon , and also of a lighter material—pine . it is furnished with a small rope called a warp , of considerable length , by which it can be hauled back to the hand after darting .
melville	moby	their hands met ; their eyes fastened ; starbuck ’ s tears the glue . “ oh , my captain , my captain ! —noble heart—go not—go not ! —see , it ’ s a brave man that weeps ; how great the agony of the persuasion then ! ”
melville	moby	“ ‘ i see ! i see ! ’ impetuously exclaimed don pedro , spilling his chicha upon his silvery ruffles . ‘ no need to travel ! the world ’ s one lima . i had thought , now , that at your temperate north the generations were cold and holy as the hills.—but the story . ’
melville	moby	my sensations were strange . let me try to explain them . when i was a child , i well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me ; whether it was a reality or a dream , i never could entirely settle . the circumstance was this . i had been cutting up some caper or other—i think it was trying to crawl up the chimney , as i had seen a little sweep do a few days previous ; and my stepmother who , somehow or other , was all the time whipping me , or sending me to bed supperless , —my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to bed , though it was only two o ’ clock in the afternoon of the 21st june , the longest day in the year in our hemisphere . i felt dreadfully . but there was no help for it , so up stairs i went to my little room in the third floor , undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time , and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets .
melville	moby	it was now about nine o ’ clock , and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet after these orgies , i began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen .
melville	moby	going forward and glancing over the weather bow , i perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide , was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean . the prospect was unlimited , but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding ; not the slightest variety that i could see .
melville	moby	“ men , ” said he , steadily turning upon the crew , as the mate handed him the things he had demanded , “ my men , the thunder turned old ahab ’ s needles ; but out of this bit of steel ahab can make one of his own , that will point as true as any . ”
melville	moby	the grounds upon which linnæus would fain have banished the whales from the waters , he states as follows : “ on account of their warm bilocular heart , their lungs , their movable eyelids , their hollow ears , penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem , ” and finally , “ ex lege naturæ jure meritoque. ” i submitted all this to my friends simeon macey and charley coffin , of nantucket , both messmates of mine in a certain voyage , and they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether insufficient . charley profanely hinted they were humbug .
melville	moby	but the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye . if you are an entire stranger to their race , you might hunt over these two heads for hours , and never discover that organ . the ear has no external leaf whatever ; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill , so wondrously minute is it . it is lodged a little behind the eye . with respect to their ears , this important difference is to be observed between the sperm whale and the right . while the ear of the former has an external opening , that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered over with a membrane , so as to be quite imperceptible from without .
melville	moby	here be it said , that like the vessels of military marines , the ships of the american whale fleet have each a private signal ; all which signals being collected in a book with the names of the respective vessels attached , every captain is provided with it . thereby , the whale commanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean , even at considerable distances and with no small facility .
melville	moby	he was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe , which , it seemed , had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed his soul , when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger . the strong vapor now completely filling the contracted hole , it began to tell upon him . he breathed with a sort of muffledness ; then seemed troubled in the nose ; then revolved over once or twice ; then sat up and rubbed his eyes .
melville	moby	“ ere the cry could go aft steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their mastheads . they were both canallers .
melville	moby	“ who dat ? den preach to him yourself , ” sullenly turning to go . “ no , cook ; go on , go on. ” “ well , den , belubed fellow-critters : ” — “ right ! ” exclaimed stubb , approvingly , “ coax ’ em to it ; try that , ” and fleece continued .
melville	moby	“ with this sin of disobedience in him , jonah still further flouts at god , by seeking to flee from him . he thinks that a ship made by men will carry him into countries where god does not reign , but only the captains of this earth . he skulks about the wharves of joppa , and seeks a ship that ’ s bound for tarshish . there lurks , perhaps , a hitherto unheeded meaning here . by all accounts tarshish could have been no other city than the modern cadiz . that ’ s the opinion of learned men . and where is cadiz , shipmates ? cadiz is in spain ; as far by water , from joppa , as jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days , when the atlantic was an almost unknown sea . because joppa , the modern jaffa , shipmates , is on the most easterly coast of the mediterranean , the syrian ; and tarshish or cadiz more than two thousand miles to the westward from that , just outside the straits of gibraltar . see ye not then , shipmates , that jonah sought to flee world-wide from god ? miserable man ! oh ! most contemptible and worthy of all scorn ; with slouched hat and guilty eye , skulking from his god ; prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas . so disordered , self-condemning is his look , that had there been policemen in those days , jonah , on the mere suspicion of something wrong , had been arrested ere he touched a deck . how plainly he ’ s a fugitive ! no baggage , not a hat-box , valise , or carpet-bag , —no friends accompany him to the wharf with their adieux . at last , after much dodging search , he finds the tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo ; and as he steps on board to see its captain in the cabin , all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the goods , to mark the stranger ’ s evil eye . jonah sees this ; but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence ; in vain essays his wretched smile . strong intuitions of the man assure the mariners he can be no innocent . in their gamesome but still serious way , one whispers to the other— “ jack , he ’ s robbed a widow ; ” or , “ joe , do you mark him ; he ’ s a bigamist ; ” or , “ harry lad , i guess he ’ s the adulterer that broke jail in old gomorrah , or belike , one of the missing murderers from sodom. ” another runs to read the bill that ’ s stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored , offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a parricide , and containing a description of his person . he reads , and looks from jonah to the bill ; while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round jonah , prepared to lay their hands upon him . frighted jonah trembles , and summoning all his boldness to his face , only looks so much the more a coward . he will not confess himself suspected ; but that itself is strong suspicion . so he makes the best of it ; and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised , they let him pass , and he descends into the cabin .

melville	moby	standing between the knight-heads , starbuck watched the pequod ’ s tumultuous way , and ahab ’ s also , as he went lurching along the deck . “ i have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow , full of its tormented flaming life ; and i have seen it wane at last , down , down , to dumbest dust . old man of oceans ! of all this fiery life of thine , what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes ! ”
melville	moby	chapter 128 . the pequod meets the rachel . next day , a large ship , the rachel , was descried , bearing directly down upon the pequod , all her spars thickly clustering with men . at the time the pequod was making good speed through the water ; but as the broad-winged windward stranger shot nigh to her , the boastful sails all fell together as blank bladders that are burst , and all life fled from the smitten hull .
melville	moby	“ in vain ! ” cried ahab ; “ but , maybe , ’ tis well . for did ye three but once take the full-forced shock , then mine own electric thing , _that_ had perhaps expired from out me . perchance , too , it would have dropped ye dead . perchance ye need it not . down lances ! and now , ye mates , i do appoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen there—yon three most honorable gentlemen and noblemen , my valiant harpooneers . disdain the task ? what , when the great pope washes the feet of beggars , using his tiara for ewer ? oh , my sweet cardinals ! your own condescension , _that_ shall bend ye to it . i do not order ye ; ye will it . cut your seizings and draw the poles , ye harpooneers ! ”
melville	moby	now , the pequod had sailed from nantucket at the very beginning of the season-on-the-line . no possible endeavor then could enable her commander to make the great passage southwards , double cape horn , and then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial pacific in time to cruise there . therefore , he must wait for the next ensuing season . yet the premature hour of the pequod ’ s sailing had , perhaps , been correctly selected by ahab , with a view to this very complexion of things . because , an interval of three hundred and sixty-five days and nights was before him ; an interval which , instead of impatiently enduring ashore , he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt ; if by chance the white whale , spending his vacation in seas far remote from his periodical feeding-grounds , should turn up his wrinkled brow off the persian gulf , or in the bengal bay , or china seas , or in any other waters haunted by his race . so that monsoons , pampas , nor ’ -westers , harmattans , trades ; any wind but the levanter and simoon , might blow moby dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle of the pequod ’ s circumnavigating wake .

melville	moby	the same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale betakes himself in his advancing years , is true of all aged sperm whales . almost universally , a lone whale—as a solitary leviathan is called—proves an ancient one . like venerable moss-bearded daniel boone , he will have no one near him but nature herself ; and her he takes to wife in the wilderness of waters , and the best of wives she is , though she keeps so many moody secrets .

melville	moby	overhearing starbuck , the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the braces—though not a sail was left aloft . for the moment all the aghast mate ’ s thoughts seemed theirs ; they raised a half mutinous cry . but dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck , and snatching the burning harpoon , ahab waved it like a torch among them ; swearing to transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope ’ s end . petrified by his aspect , and still more shrinking from the fiery dart that he held , the men fell back in dismay , and ahab again spoke : —

melville	moby	i lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse before i could hope for a resurrection . sixteen hours in bed ! the small of my back ached to think of it . and it was so light too ; the sun shining in at the window , and a great rattling of coaches in the streets , and the sound of gay voices all over the house . i felt worse and worse—at last i got up , dressed , and softly going down in my stockinged feet , sought out my stepmother , and suddenly threw myself at her feet , beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good slippering for my misbehaviour ; anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time . but she was the best and most conscientious of stepmothers , and back i had to go to my room . for several hours i lay there broad awake , feeling a great deal worse than i have ever done since , even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes . at last i must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze ; and slowly waking from it—half steeped in dreams—i opened my eyes , and the before sun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness . instantly i felt a shock running through all my frame ; nothing was to be seen , and nothing was to be heard ; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine . my arm hung over the counterpane , and the nameless , unimaginable , silent form or phantom , to which the hand belonged , seemed closely seated by my bed-side . for what seemed ages piled on ages , i lay there , frozen with the most awful fears , not daring to drag away my hand ; yet ever thinking that if i could but stir it one single inch , the horrid spell would be broken . i knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me ; but waking in the morning , i shudderingly remembered it all , and for days and weeks and months afterwards i lost myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery . nay , to this very hour , i often puzzle myself with it .
melville	moby	“ i don ’ t half understand ye : what ’ s in the wind ? ” “ yes , yes , round the cape of good hope is the shortest way to nantucket , ” soliloquized starbuck suddenly , heedless of stubb ’ s question . “ the gale that now hammers at us to stave us , we can turn it into a fair wind that will drive us towards home . yonder , to windward , all is blackness of doom ; but to leeward , homeward—i see it lightens up there ; but not with the lightning . ”

melville	moby	chapter 130 . the hat . and now that at the proper time and place , after so long and wide a preliminary cruise , ahab , —all other whaling waters swept—seemed to have chased his foe into an ocean-fold , to slay him the more securely there ; now , that he found himself hard by the very latitude and longitude where his tormenting wound had been inflicted ; now that a vessel had been spoken which on the very day preceding had actually encountered moby dick ; —and now that all his successive meetings with various ships contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indifference with which the white whale tore his hunters , whether sinning or sinned against ; now it was that there lurked a something in the old man ’ s eyes , which it was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see . as the unsetting polar star , which through the livelong , arctic , six months ’ night sustains its piercing , steady , central gaze ; so ahab ’ s purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew . it domineered above them so , that all their bodings , doubts , misgivings , fears , were fain to hide beneath their souls , and not sprout forth a single spear or leaf .

melville	moby	the large importance attached to the harpooneer ’ s vocation is evinced by the fact , that originally in the old dutch fishery , two centuries and more ago , the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the person now called the captain , but was divided between him and an officer called the specksnyder . literally this word means fat-cutter ; usage , however , in time made it equivalent to chief harpooneer . in those days , the captain ’ s authority was restricted to the navigation and general management of the vessel ; while over the whale-hunting department and all its concerns , the specksnyder or chief harpooneer reigned supreme . in the british greenland fishery , under the corrupted title of specksioneer , this old dutch official is still retained , but his former dignity is sadly abridged . at present he ranks simply as senior harpooneer ; and as such , is but one of the captain ’ s more inferior subalterns . nevertheless , as upon the good conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends , and since in the american fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat , but under certain circumstances ( night watches on a whaling ground ) the command of the ship ’ s deck is also his ; therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands , that he should nominally live apart from the men before the mast , and be in some way distinguished as their professional superior ; though always , by them , familiarly regarded as their social equal .
melville	moby	“ ‘ what are you making there ? ’ said a shipmate . “ ‘ what do you think ? what does it look like ? ’ “ ‘ like a lanyard for your bag ; but it ’ s an odd one , seems to me . ’

melville	moby	* partly to show the indispensableness of this act , it may here be stated , that , in the old dutch fishery , a mop was used to dash the running line with water ; in many other ships , a wooden piggin , or bailer , is set apart for that purpose . your hat , however , is the most convenient .
melville	moby	“ it is his. ” “ won ’ t the duke be content with a quarter or a half ? ” “ it is his. ” in a word , the whale was seized and sold , and his grace the duke of wellington received the money . thinking that viewed in some particular lights , the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be deemed , under the circumstances , a rather hard one , an honest clergyman of the town respectfully addressed a note to his grace , begging him to take the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration . to which my lord duke in substance replied ( both letters were published ) that he had already done so , and received the money , and would be obliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he ( the reverend gentleman ) would decline meddling with other people ’ s business . is this the still militant old man , standing at the corners of the three kingdoms , on all hands coercing alms of beggars ?
melville	moby	here be it said , that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale , continued through day into night , and through night into day , is a thing by no means unprecedented in the south sea fishery . for such is the wonderful skill , prescience of experience , and invincible confidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the nantucket commanders ; that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried , they will , under certain given circumstances , pretty accurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue to swim for a time , while out of sight , as well as his probable rate of progression during that period . and , in these cases , somewhat as a pilot , when about losing sight of a coast , whose general trending he well knows , and which he desires shortly to return to again , but at some further point ; like as this pilot stands by his compass , and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present visible , in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote , unseen headland , eventually to be visited : so does the fisherman , at his compass , with the whale ; for after being chased , and diligently marked , through several hours of daylight , then , when night obscures the fish , the creature ’ s future wake through the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter , as the pilot ’ s coast is to him . so that to this hunter ’ s wondrous skill , the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water , a wake , is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land . and as the mighty iron leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly known in its every pace , that , with watches in their hands , men time his rate as doctors that of a baby ’ s pulse ; and lightly say of it , the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot , at such or such an hour ; even so , almost , there are occasions when these nantucketers time that other leviathan of the deep , according to the observed humor of his speed ; and say to themselves , so many hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles , will have about reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude . but to render this acuteness at all successful in the end , the wind and the sea must be the whaleman ’ s allies ; for of what present avail to the becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is exactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter from his port ? inferable from these statements , are many collateral subtile matters touching the chase of whales .

melville	moby	but if from the comparative dimensions of the whale ’ s proper brain , you deem it incapable of being adequately charted , then i have another idea for you . if you attentively regard almost any quadruped ’ s spine , you will be struck with the resemblance of its vertebræ to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls , all bearing rudimental resemblance to the skull proper . it is a german conceit , that the vertebræ are absolutely undeveloped skulls . but the curious external resemblance , i take it the germans were not the first men to perceive . a foreign friend once pointed it out to me , in the skeleton of a foe he had slain , and with the vertebræ of which he was inlaying , in a sort of basso-relievo , the beaked prow of his canoe . now , i consider that the phrenologists have omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the cerebellum through the spinal canal . for i believe that much of a man ’ s character will be found betokened in his backbone . i would rather feel your spine than your skull , whoever you are . a thin joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul . i rejoice in my spine , as in the firm audacious staff of that flag which i fling half out to the world .

melville	moby	plum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the whale ’ s flesh , here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber , and often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness . it is a most refreshing , convivial , beautiful object to behold . as its name imports , it is of an exceedingly rich , mottled tint , with a bestreaked snowy and golden ground , dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and purple . it is plums of rubies , in pictures of citron . spite of reason , it is hard to keep yourself from eating it . i confess , that once i stole behind the foremast to try it . it tasted something as i should conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of louis le gros might have tasted , supposing him to have been killed the first day after the venison season , and that particular venison season contemporary with an unusually fine vintage of the vineyards of champagne .

melville	moby	it is upon record , that three centuries ago the tongue of the right whale was esteemed a great delicacy in france , and commanded large prices there . also , that in henry viiith ’ s time , a certain cook of the court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbacued porpoises , which , you remember , are a species of whale . porpoises , indeed , are to this day considered fine eating . the meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls , and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle-balls or veal balls . the old monks of dunfermline were very fond of them . they had a great porpoise grant from the crown .
melville	moby	now , in the whale ship , it is not every one that goes in the boats . some few hands are reserved called ship-keepers , whose province it is to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale . as a general thing , these ship-keepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats ’ crews . but if there happen to be an unduly slender , clumsy , or timorous wight in the ship , that wight is certain to be made a ship-keeper . it was so in the pequod with the little negro pippin by nick-name , pip by abbreviation . poor pip ! ye have heard of him before ; ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight , so gloomy-jolly .
melville	moby	yes , we became very wakeful ; so much so that our recumbent position began to grow wearisome , and by little and little we found ourselves sitting up ; the clothes well tucked around us , leaning against the head-board with our four knees drawn up close together , and our two noses bending over them , as if our kneepans were warming-pans . we felt very nice and snug , the more so since it was so chilly out of doors ; indeed out of bed-clothes too , seeing that there was no fire in the room . the more so , i say , because truly to enjoy bodily warmth , some small part of you must be cold , for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast . nothing exists in itself . if you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable , and have been so a long time , then you can not be said to be comfortable any more . but if , like queequeg and me in the bed , the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled , why then , indeed , in the general consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm . for this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire , which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich . for the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air . then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal .

melville	moby	these are scientific commentaries ; but the commentaries of the whalemen themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks—the coke-upon-littleton of the fist . true , among the more upright and honorable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases , where it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party . but others are by no means so scrupulous .
melville	moby	wet , drenched through , and shivering cold , despairing of ship or boat , we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on . the mist still spread over the sea , the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat . suddenly queequeg started to his feet , hollowing his hand to his ear . we all heard a faint creaking , as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled by the storm . the sound came nearer and nearer ; the thick mists were dimly parted by a huge , vague form . affrighted , we all sprang into the sea as the ship at last loomed into view , bearing right down upon us within a distance of not much more than its length .
melville	moby	not a man of the crew but gave him up ; and , as for queequeg himself , what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he asked . he called one to him in the grey morning watch , when the day was just breaking , and taking his hand , said that while in nantucket he had chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood , like the rich war-wood of his native isle ; and upon inquiry , he had learned that all whalemen who died in nantucket , were laid in those same dark canoes , and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him ; for it was not unlike the custom of his own race , who , after embalming a dead warrior , stretched him out in his canoe , and so left him to be floated away to the starry archipelagoes ; for not only do they believe that the stars are isles , but that far beyond all visible horizons , their own mild , uncontinented seas , interflow with the blue heavens ; and so form the white breakers of the milky way . he added , that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammock , according to the usual sea-custom , tossed like something vile to the death-devouring sharks . no : he desired a canoe like those of nantucket , all the more congenial to him , being a whaleman , that like a whale-boat these coffin-canoes were without a keel ; though that involved but uncertain steering , and much lee-way adown the dim ages .
melville	moby	chapter 67 . cutting in . it was a saturday night , and such a sabbath as followed ! ex officio professors of sabbath breaking are all whalemen . the ivory pequod was turned into what seemed a shamble ; every sailor a butcher . you would have thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods .
melville	moby	“ oh , very severe ! ” chimed in the patient himself ; then suddenly altering his voice , “ drinking hot rum toddies with me every night , till he couldn ’ t see to put on the bandages ; and sending me to bed , half seas over , about three o ’ clock in the morning . oh , ye stars ! he sat up with me indeed , and was very severe in my diet . oh ! a great watcher , and very dietetically severe , is dr. bunger . ( bunger , you dog , laugh out ! why don ’ t ye ? you know you ’ re a precious jolly rascal . ) but , heave ahead , boy , i ’ d rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other man . ”
melville	moby	first : what is a fast-fish ? alive or dead a fish is technically fast , when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat , by any medium at all controllable by the occupant or occupants , —a mast , an oar , a nine-inch cable , a telegraph wire , or a strand of cobweb , it is all the same . likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif , or any other recognised symbol of possession ; so long as the party waifing it plainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside , as well as their intention so to do .
melville	moby	nor was ahab unmindful of another thing . in times of strong emotion mankind disdain all base considerations ; but such times are evanescent . the permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man , thought ahab , is sordidness . granting that the white whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew , and playing round their savageness even breeds a certain generous knight-errantism in them , still , while for the love of it they give chase to moby dick , they must also have food for their more common , daily appetites . for even the high lifted and chivalric crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two thousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre , without committing burglaries , picking pockets , and gaining other pious perquisites by the way . had they been strictly held to their one final and romantic object—that final and romantic object , too many would have turned from in disgust . i will not strip these men , thought ahab , of all hopes of cash—aye , cash . they may scorn cash now ; but let some months go by , and no perspective promise of it to them , and then this same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them , this same cash would soon cashier ahab .
melville	moby	but not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness , and learned why it appeals with such power to the soul ; and more strange and far more portentous—why , as we have seen , it is at once the most meaning symbol of spiritual things , nay , the very veil of the christian ’ s deity ; and yet should be as it is , the intensifying agent in things the most appalling to mankind .
melville	moby	but at last in his untraceable evolutions , the white whale so crossed and recrossed , and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three lines now fast to him , that they foreshortened , and , of themselves , warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him ; though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little , as if to rally for a more tremendous charge . seizing that opportunity , ahab first paid out more line : and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again—hoping that way to disencumber it of some snarls—when lo ! —a sight more savage than the embattled teeth of sharks !
melville	moby	during all this , queequeg lay with closed eyes , as if in a dream . pip was led away , and the sick man was replaced in his hammock . but now that he had apparently made every preparation for death ; now that his coffin was proved a good fit , queequeg suddenly rallied ; soon there seemed no need of the carpenter ’ s box : and thereupon , when some expressed their delighted surprise , he , in substance , said , that the cause of his sudden convalescence was this ; —at a critical moment , he had just recalled a little duty ashore , which he was leaving undone ; and therefore had changed his mind about dying : he could not die yet , he averred . they asked him , then , whether to live or die was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure . he answered , certainly . in a word , it was queequeg ’ s conceit , that if a man made up his mind to live , mere sickness could not kill him : nothing but a whale , or a gale , or some violent , ungovernable , unintelligent destroyer of that sort .
melville	moby	every whale-ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various ships , whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed , depends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans . thus , most letters never reach their mark ; and many are only received after attaining an age of two or three years or more .
melville	moby	the pequod ’ s signal was at last responded to by the stranger ’ s setting her own ; which proved the ship to be the jeroboam of nantucket . squaring her yards , she bore down , ranged abeam under the pequod ’ s lee , and lowered a boat ; it soon drew nigh ; but , as the side-ladder was being rigged by starbuck ’ s order to accommodate the visiting captain , the stranger in question waved his hand from his boat ’ s stern in token of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary . it turned out that the jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board , and that mayhew , her captain , was fearful of infecting the pequod ’ s company . for , though himself and boat ’ s crew remained untainted , and though his ship was half a rifle-shot off , and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between ; yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the land , he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the pequod .
melville	moby	it is often the case that when a boat is stove , its crew , being picked up by another boat , help to work that second boat ; and the chase is thus continued with what is called double-banked oars . it was thus now . but the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale , for he seemed to have treble-banked his every fin ; swimming with a velocity which plainly showed , that if now , under these circumstances , pushed on , the chase would prove an indefinitely prolonged , if not a hopeless one ; nor could any crew endure for so long a period , such an unintermitted , intense straining at the oar ; a thing barely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude . the ship itself , then , as it sometimes happens , offered the most promising intermediate means of overtaking the chase . accordingly , the boats now made for her , and were soon swayed up to their cranes—the two parts of the wrecked boat having been previously secured by her—and then hoisting everything to her side , and stacking her canvas high up , and sideways outstretching it with stun-sails , like the double-jointed wings of an albatross ; the pequod bore down in the leeward wake of moby-dick . at the well known , methodic intervals , the whale ’ s glittering spout was regularly announced from the manned mast-heads ; and when he would be reported as just gone down , ahab would take the time , and then pacing the deck , binnacle-watch in hand , so soon as the last second of the allotted hour expired , his voice was heard.— “ whose is the doubloon now ? d ’ ye see him ? ” and if the reply was , no , sir ! straightway he commanded them to lift him to his perch . in this way the day wore on ; ahab , now aloft and motionless ; anon , unrestingly pacing the planks .
melville	moby	in the first place , you are struck by the general contrast between these heads . both are massive enough in all conscience ; but there is a certain mathematical symmetry in the sperm whale ’ s which the right whale ’ s sadly lacks . there is more character in the sperm whale ’ s head . as you behold it , you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him , in point of pervading dignity . in the present instance , too , this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit , giving token of advanced age and large experience . in short , he is what the fishermen technically call a “ grey-headed whale . ”
melville	moby	it is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera , that i would now fain put before you . yet is it no easy task . the classification of the constituents of a chaos , nothing less is here essayed . listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down .
melville	moby	in old norse times , the thrones of the sea-loving danish kings were fabricated , saith tradition , of the tusks of the narwhale . how could one look at ahab then , seated on that tripod of bones , without bethinking him of the royalty it symbolized ? for a khan of the plank , and a king of the sea , and a great lord of leviathans was ahab .
melville	moby	“ for the white fiend ! but now for the barbs ; thou must make them thyself , man . here are my razors—the best of steel ; here , and make the barbs sharp as the needle-sleet of the icy sea . ”
melville	moby	but it may possibly be conceived that , in the internal parts of the whale , in his anatomy—there , at least , we shall be able to hit the right classification . nay ; what thing , for example , is there in the greenland whale ’ s anatomy more striking than his baleen ? yet we have seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the greenland whale . and if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans , why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as available to the systematizer as those external ones already enumerated . what then remains ? nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily , in their entire liberal volume , and boldly sort them that way . and this is the bibliographical system here adopted ; and it is the only one that can possibly succeed , for it alone is practicable . to proceed .
melville	moby	starbuck saw the old man ; saw him , how he heavily leaned over the side ; and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing that stole out of the centre of the serenity around . careful not to touch him , or be noticed by him , he yet drew near to him , and stood there .
melville	moby	chapter 80 . the nut . if the sperm whale be physiognomically a sphinx , to the phrenologist his brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square . in the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet in length . unhinge the lower jaw , and the side view of this skull is as the side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level base . but in life—as we have elsewhere seen—this inclined plane is angularly filled up , and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent mass of the junk and sperm . at the high end the skull forms a crater to bed that part of the mass ; while under the long floor of this crater—in another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in depth—reposes the mere handful of this monster ’ s brain . the brain is at least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life ; it is hidden away behind its vast outworks , like the innermost citadel within the amplified fortifications of quebec . so like a choice casket is it secreted in him , that i have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the sperm whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance of one formed by the cubic-yards of his sperm magazine . lying in strange folds , courses , and convolutions , to their apprehensions , it seems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that mystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence .
melville	moby	bethink thee of the albatross , whence come those clouds of spiritual wonderment and pale dread , in which that white phantom sails in all imaginations ? not coleridge first threw that spell ; but god ’ s great , unflattering laureate , nature . *
melville	moby	“ then tell me ; art thou not an arrant , all-grasping , intermeddling , monopolising , heathenish old scamp , to be one day making legs , and the next day coffins to clap them in , and yet again life-buoys out of those same coffins ? thou art as unprincipled as the gods , and as much of a jack-of-all-trades . ”
melville	moby	“ killed more whales than i can count , captain peleg. ” “ well , bring him along then. ” and , after signing the papers , off i went ; nothing doubting but that i had done a good morning ’ s work , and that the pequod was the identical ship that yojo had provided to carry queequeg and me round the cape .
melville	moby	by the above definition of what a whale is , i do by no means exclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by the best informed nantucketers ; nor , on the other hand , link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien . * hence , all the smaller , spouting , and horizontal tailed fish must be included in this ground-plan of cetology . now , then , come the grand divisions of the entire whale host .
melville	moby	“ what ’ s this ? here ’ s velvet shark-skin , ” intently gazing at ahab ’ s hand , and feeling it . “ ah , now , had poor pip but felt so kind a thing as this , perhaps he had ne ’ er been lost ! this seems to me , sir , as a man-rope ; something that weak souls may hold by . oh , sir , let old perth now come and rivet these two hands together ; the black one with the white , for i will not let this go . ”
melville	moby	soothed again , but only soothed to deeper gloom , ahab , who had sterned off from the whale , sat intently watching his final wanings from the now tranquil boat . for that strange spectacle observable in all sperm whales dying—the turning sunwards of the head , and so expiring—that strange spectacle , beheld of such a placid evening , somehow to ahab conveyed a wondrousness unknown before .
melville	moby	“ d ’ ye see him ? ” cried ahab ; but the whale was not yet in sight . “ in his infallible wake , though ; but follow that wake , that ’ s all . helm there ; steady , as thou goest , and hast been going . what a lovely day again ! were it a new-made world , and made for a summer-house to the angels , and this morning the first of its throwing open to them , a fairer day could not dawn upon that world . here ’ s food for thought , had ahab time to think ; but ahab never thinks ; he only feels , feels , feels ; _that ’ s_ tingling enough for mortal man ! to think ’ s audacity . god only has that right and privilege . thinking is , or ought to be , a coolness and a calmness ; and our poor hearts throb , and our poor brains beat too much for that . and yet , i ’ ve sometimes thought my brain was very calm—frozen calm , this old skull cracks so , like a glass in which the contents turned to ice , and shiver it . and still this hair is growing now ; this moment growing , and heat must breed it ; but no , it ’ s like that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere , between the earthy clefts of greenland ice or in vesuvius lava . how the wild winds blow it ; they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they cling to . a vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this through prison corridors and cells , and wards of hospitals , and ventilated them , and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces . out upon it ! —it ’ s tainted . were i the wind , i ’ d blow no more on such a wicked , miserable world . i ’ d crawl somewhere to a cave , and slink there . and yet , ’ tis a noble and heroic thing , the wind ! who ever conquered it ? in every fight it has the last and bitterest blow . run tilting at it , and you but run through it . ha ! a coward wind that strikes stark naked men , but will not stand to receive a single blow . even ahab is a braver thing—a nobler thing than _that_ . would now the wind but had a body ; but all the things that most exasperate and outrage mortal man , all these things are bodiless , but only bodiless as objects , not as agents . there ’ s a most special , a most cunning , oh , a most malicious difference ! and yet , i say again , and swear it now , that there ’ s something all glorious and gracious in the wind . these warm trade winds , at least , that in the clear heavens blow straight on , in strong and steadfast , vigorous mildness ; and veer not from their mark , however the baser currents of the sea may turn and tack , and mightiest mississippies of the land swift and swerve about , uncertain where to go at last . and by the eternal poles ! these same trades that so directly blow my good ship on ; these trades , or something like them—something so unchangeable , and full as strong , blow my keeled soul along ! to it ! aloft there ! what d ’ ye see ? ”
melville	moby	in old times , there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies concerning these blinds . one voyager in purchas calls them the wondrous “ whiskers ” inside of the whale ’ s mouth ; * another , “ hogs ’ bristles ” ; a third old gentleman in hackluyt uses the following elegant language : “ there are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his upper _chop_ , which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth . ”
melville	moby	first : i have personally known three instances where a whale , after receiving a harpoon , has effected a complete escape ; and , after an interval ( in one instance of three years ) , has been again struck by the same hand , and slain ; when the two irons , both marked by the same private cypher , have been taken from the body . in the instance where three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons ; and i think it may have been something more than that ; the man who darted them happening , in the interval , to go in a trading ship on a voyage to africa , went ashore there , joined a discovery party , and penetrated far into the interior , where he travelled for a period of nearly two years , often endangered by serpents , savages , tigers , poisonous miasmas , with all the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown regions . meanwhile , the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels ; no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe , brushing with its flanks all the coasts of africa ; but to no purpose . this man and this whale again came together , and the one vanquished the other . i say i , myself , have known three instances similar to this ; that is in two of them i saw the whales struck ; and , upon the second attack , saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them , afterwards taken from the dead fish . in the three-year instance , it so fell out that i was in the boat both times , first and last , and the last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale ’ s eye , which i had observed there three years previous . i say three years , but i am pretty sure it was more than that . here are three instances , then , which i personally know the truth of ; but i have heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no good ground to impeach .
melville	moby	now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be found in the heart of such decay ; is this nothing ? bethink thee of that saying of st. paul in corinthians , about corruption and incorruption ; how that we are sown in dishonor , but raised in glory . and likewise call to mind that saying of paracelsus about what it is that maketh the best musk . also forget not the strange fact that of all things of ill-savor , cologne-water , in its rudimental manufacturing stages , is the worst .
melville	moby	but no more of this blubbering now , we are going a-whaling , and there is plenty of that yet to come . let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet , and see what sort of a place this “ spouter ” may be .
melville	moby	assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale ; then , when this skin , as in the case of a very large sperm whale , will yield the bulk of one hundred barrels of oil ; and , when it is considered that , in quantity , or rather weight , that oil , in its expressed state , is only three fourths , and not the entire substance of the coat ; some idea may hence be had of the enormousness of that animated mass , a mere part of whose mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that . reckoning ten barrels to the ton , you have ten tons for the net weight of only three quarters of the stuff of the whale ’ s skin .
melville	moby	now , inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving outer circles , and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in any one of those circles , the entire area at this juncture , embraced by the whole multitude , must have contained at least two or three square miles . at any rate—though indeed such a test at such a time might be deceptive—spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon . i mention this circumstance , because , as if the cows and calves had been purposely locked up in this innermost fold ; and as if the wide extent of the herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its stopping ; or , possibly , being so young , unsophisticated , and every way innocent and inexperienced ; however it may have been , these smaller whales—now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the lake—evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence , or else a still becharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at . like household dogs they came snuffling round us , right up to our gunwales , and touching them ; till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them . queequeg patted their foreheads ; starbuck scratched their backs with his lance ; but fearful of the consequences , for the time refrained from darting it .
melville	moby	“ young man , ” said bildad sternly , “ thou art skylarking with me—explain thyself , thou young hittite . what church dost thee mean ? answer me. ” finding myself thus hard pushed , i replied . “ i mean , sir , the same ancient catholic church to which you and i , and captain peleg there , and queequeg here , and all of us , and every mother ’ s son and soul of us belong ; the great and everlasting first congregation of this whole worshipping world ; we all belong to that ; only some of us cherish some queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief ; in _that_ we all join hands . ”
melville	moby	soon the two ships diverged their wakes ; and long as the strange vessel was in view , she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot , however small , on the sea . this way and that her yards were swung round ; starboard and larboard , she continued to tack ; now she beat against a head sea ; and again it pushed her before it ; while all the while , her masts and yards were thickly clustered with men , as three tall cherry trees , when the boys are cherrying among the boughs .
melville	moby	and thus the first man of the pequod that mounted the mast to look out for the white whale , on the white whale ’ s own peculiar ground ; that man was swallowed up in the deep . but few , perhaps , thought of that at the time . indeed , in some sort , they were not grieved at this event , at least as a portent ; for they regarded it , not as a foreshadowing of evil in the future , but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged . they declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they had heard the night before . but again the old manxman said nay .
melville	moby	chapter 106 . ahab ’ s leg . the precipitating manner in which captain ahab had quitted the samuel enderby of london , had not been unattended with some small violence to his own person . he had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his boat that his ivory leg had received a half-splintering shock . and when after gaining his own deck , and his own pivot-hole there , he so vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman ( it was , as ever , something about his not steering inflexibly enough ) ; then , the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and wrench , that though it still remained entire , and to all appearances lusty , yet ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy .
melville	moby	and so saying , he placed himself half way within the scuttle , and slouching his hat , stood there till dawn , except when at intervals rousing himself to see how the night wore on .
melville	moby	now having a night , a day , and still another night following before me in new bedford , ere i could embark for my destined port , it became a matter of concernment where i was to eat and sleep meanwhile . it was a very dubious-looking , nay , a very dark and dismal night , bitingly cold and cheerless . i knew no one in the place . with anxious grapnels i had sounded my pocket , and only brought up a few pieces of silver , —so , wherever you go , ishmael , said i to myself , as i stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag , and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the south—wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night , my dear ishmael , be sure to inquire the price , and don ’ t be too particular .
melville	moby	it seemed that the jeroboam had not long left home , when upon speaking a whale-ship , her people were reliably apprised of the existence of moby dick , and the havoc he had made . greedily sucking in this intelligence , gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the white whale , in case the monster should be seen ; in his gibbering insanity , pronouncing the white whale to be no less a being than the shaker god incarnated ; the shakers receiving the bible . but when , some year or two afterwards , moby dick was fairly sighted from the mast-heads , macey , the chief mate , burned with ardour to encounter him ; and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity , despite all the archangel ’ s denunciations and forewarnings , macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat . with them he pushed off ; and , after much weary pulling , and many perilous , unsuccessful onsets , he at last succeeded in getting one iron fast . meantime , gabriel , ascending to the main-royal mast-head , was tossing one arm in frantic gestures , and hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity . now , while macey , the mate , was standing up in his boat ’ s bow , and with all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the whale , and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance , lo ! a broad white shadow rose from the sea ; by its quick , fanning motion , temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen . next instant , the luckless mate , so full of furious life , was smitten bodily into the air , and making a long arc in his descent , fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards . not a chip of the boat was harmed , nor a hair of any oarsman ’ s head ; but the mate for ever sank .
melville	moby	after all , i do not think that my remarks about religion made much impression upon queequeg . because , in the first place , he somehow seemed dull of hearing on that important subject , unless considered from his own point of view ; and , in the second place , he did not more than one third understand me , couch my ideas simply as i would ; and , finally , he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than i did . he looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and compassion , as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety .
melville	moby	“ stern all ! oh moby dick , i clutch thy heart at last ! ” such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old man ’ s tormented sleep , as if starbuck ’ s voice had caused the long dumb dream to speak .
melville	moby	some moments passed , during which the thick vapor came from his mouth in quick and constant puffs , which blew back again into his face . “ how now , ” he soliloquized at last , withdrawing the tube , “ this smoking no longer soothes . oh , my pipe ! hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone ! here have i been unconsciously toiling , not pleasuring—aye , and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while ; to windward , and with such nervous whiffs , as if , like the dying whale , my final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble . what business have i with this pipe ? this thing that is meant for sereneness , to send up mild white vapors among mild white hairs , not among torn iron-grey locks like mine . i ’ ll smoke no more— ”
melville	moby	“ avast , ” cried ahab— “ touch not a rope-yarn ” ; then in a voice that prolongingly moulded every word— “ captain gardiner , i will not do it . even now i lose time . good-bye , good-bye . god bless ye , man , and may i forgive myself , but i must go . mr. starbuck , look at the binnacle watch , and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all strangers : then brace forward again , and let the ship sail as before . ”
melville	moby	i know not with what fine and costly material the heidelburgh tun was coated within , but in superlative richness that coating could not possibly have compared with the silken pearl-coloured membrane , like the lining of a fine pelisse , forming the inner surface of the sperm whale ’ s case .
melville	moby	as the type of the folio i present the _sperm whale_ ; of the octavo , the _grampus_ ; of the duodecimo , the _porpoise_ . folios . among these i here include the following chapters : —i . the _sperm whale_ ; ii . the _right whale_ ; iii . the _fin-back whale_ ; iv . the _hump-backed whale_ ; v. the _razor back whale_ ; vi . the _sulphur bottom whale_ .
melville	moby	in thoroughfares nigh the docks , any considerable seaport will frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign parts . even in broadway and chestnut streets , mediterranean mariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies . regent street is not unknown to lascars and malays ; and at bombay , in the apollo green , live yankees have often scared the natives . but new bedford beats all water street and wapping . in these last-mentioned haunts you see only sailors ; but in new bedford , actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners ; savages outright ; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh . it makes a stranger stare .
melville	moby	third : i can not demonstrate it , but it seems to me , that in the whale the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail ; for in this respect there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the elephant ’ s trunk . this delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of sweeping , when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of the sea ; and if he feel but a sailor ’ s whisker , woe to that sailor , whiskers and all . what tenderness there is in that preliminary touch ! had this tail any prehensile power , i should straightway bethink me of darmonodes ’ elephant that so frequented the flower-market , and with low salutations presented nosegays to damsels , and then caressed their zones . on more accounts than one , a pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in his tail ; for i have heard of yet another elephant , that when wounded in the fight , curved round his trunk and extracted the dart .
melville	moby	“ he goes off in a huff . the whole he can endure ; at the parts he baulks . now i don ’ t like this . i make a leg for captain ahab , and he wears it like a gentleman ; but i make a bandbox for queequeg , and he won ’ t put his head into it . are all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin ? and now i ’ m ordered to make a life-buoy of it . it ’ s like turning an old coat ; going to bring the flesh on the other side now . i don ’ t like this cobbling sort of business—i don ’ t like it at all ; it ’ s undignified ; it ’ s not my place . let tinkers ’ brats do tinkerings ; we are their betters . i like to take in hand none but clean , virgin , fair-and-square mathematical jobs , something that regularly begins at the beginning , and is at the middle when midway , and comes to an end at the conclusion ; not a cobbler ’ s job , that ’ s at an end in the middle , and at the beginning at the end . it ’ s the old woman ’ s tricks to be giving cobbling jobs . lord ! what an affection all old women have for tinkers . i know an old woman of sixty-five who ran away with a bald-headed young tinker once . and that ’ s the reason i never would work for lonely widow old women ashore , when i kept my job-shop in the vineyard ; they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run off with me . but heigh-ho ! there are no caps at sea but snow-caps . let me see . nail down the lid ; caulk the seams ; pay over the same with pitch ; batten them down tight , and hang it with the snap-spring over the ship ’ s stern . were ever such things done before with a coffin ? some superstitious old carpenters , now , would be tied up in the rigging , ere they would do the job . but i ’ m made of knotty aroostook hemlock ; i don ’ t budge . cruppered with a coffin ! sailing about with a grave-yard tray ! but never mind . we workers in woods make bridal-bedsteads and card-tables , as well as coffins and hearses . we work by the month , or by the job , or by the profit ; not for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work , unless it be too confounded cobbling , and then we stash it if we can . hem ! i ’ ll do the job , now , tenderly . i ’ ll have me—let ’ s see—how many in the ship ’ s company , all told ? but i ’ ve forgotten . any way , i ’ ll have me thirty separate , turk ’ s-headed life-lines , each three feet long hanging all round to the coffin . then , if the hull go down , there ’ ll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for one coffin , a sight not seen very often beneath the sun ! come hammer , caulking-iron , pitch-pot , and marling-spike ! let ’ s to it . ”
melville	moby	* the following are extracts from chace ’ s narrative : “ every fact seemed to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which directed his operations ; he made two several attacks upon the ship , at a short interval between them , both of which , according to their direction , were calculated to do us the most injury , by being made ahead , and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the shock ; to effect which , the exact manœuvres which he made were necessary . his aspect was most horrible , and such as indicated resentment and fury . he came directly from the shoal which we had just before entered , and in which we had struck three of his companions , as if fired with revenge for their sufferings. ” again : “ at all events , the whole circumstances taken together , all happening before my own eyes , and producing , at the time , impressions in my mind of decided , calculating mischief , on the part of the whale ( many of which impressions i can not now recall ) , induce me to be satisfied that i am correct in my opinion . ”
melville	moby	chapter 76 . the battering-ram . ere quitting , for the nonce , the sperm whale ’ s head , i would have you , as a sensible physiologist , simply—particularly remark its front aspect , in all its compacted collectedness . i would have you investigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some unexaggerated , intelligent estimate of whatever battering-ram power may be lodged there . here is a vital point ; for you must either satisfactorily settle this matter with yourself , or for ever remain an infidel as to one of the most appalling , but not the less true events , perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history .
melville	moby	at last we rose and dressed ; and queequeg , taking a prodigiously hearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts , so that the landlady should not make much profit by reason of his ramadan , we sallied out to board the pequod , sauntering along , and picking our teeth with halibut bones .
melville	moby	“ look you , ” roared the captain , “ i ’ ll kill-e _you_ , you cannibal , if you try any more of your tricks aboard here ; so mind your eye. ” but it so happened just then , that it was high time for the captain to mind his own eye . the prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted the weather-sheet , and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side , completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck . the poor fellow whom queequeg had handled so roughly , was swept overboard ; all hands were in a panic ; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it , seemed madness . it flew from right to left , and back again , almost in one ticking of a watch , and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into splinters . nothing was done , and nothing seemed capable of being done ; those on deck rushed towards the bows , and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale . in the midst of this consternation , queequeg dropped deftly to his knees , and crawling under the path of the boom , whipped hold of a rope , secured one end to the bulwarks , and then flinging the other like a lasso , caught it round the boom as it swept over his head , and at the next jerk , the spar was that way trapped , and all was safe . the schooner was run into the wind , and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat , queequeg , stripped to the waist , darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap . for three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog , throwing his long arms straight out before him , and by turns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam . i looked at the grand and glorious fellow , but saw no one to be saved . the greenhorn had gone down . shooting himself perpendicularly from the water , queequeg , now took an instant ’ s glance around him , and seeming to see just how matters were , dived down and disappeared . a few minutes more , and he rose again , one arm still striking out , and with the other dragging a lifeless form . the boat soon picked them up . the poor bumpkin was restored . all hands voted queequeg a noble trump ; the captain begged his pardon . from that hour i clove to queequeg like a barnacle ; yea , till poor queequeg took his last long dive .
melville	moby	book ii . ( _octavo_ ) , chapter iii . ( _narwhale_ ) , that is , _nostril whale_.—another instance of a curiously named whale , so named i suppose from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose . the creature is some sixteen feet in length , while its horn averages five feet , though some exceed ten , and even attain to fifteen feet . strictly speaking , this horn is but a lengthened tusk , growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal . but it is only found on the sinister side , which has an ill effect , giving its owner something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man . what precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers , it would be hard to say . it does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword-fish and bill-fish ; though some sailors tell me that the narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food . charley coffin said it was used for an ice-piercer ; for the narwhale , rising to the surface of the polar sea , and finding it sheeted with ice , thrusts his horn up , and so breaks through . but you can not prove either of these surmises to be correct . my own opinion is , that however this one-sided horn may really be used by the narwhale—however that may be—it would certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets . the narwhale i have heard called the tusked whale , the horned whale , and the unicorn whale . he is certainly a curious example of the unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature . from certain cloistered old authors i have gathered that this same sea-unicorn ’ s horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote against poison , and as such , preparations of it brought immense prices . it was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies , the same way that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn . originally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity . black letter tells me that sir martin frobisher on his return from that voyage , when queen bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of greenwich palace , as his bold ship sailed down the thames ; “ when sir martin returned from that voyage , ” saith black letter , “ on bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the narwhale , which for a long period after hung in the castle at windsor. ” an irish author avers that the earl of leicester , on bended knees , did likewise present to her highness another horn , pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature .
melville	moby	“ aft here , ye sons of bachelors , ” he cried , as the sailors lingered at the main-mast . “ mr . starbuck , drive ’ em aft. ” “ strike the tent there ! ” —was the next order . as i hinted before , this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port ; and on board the pequod , for thirty years , the order to strike the tent was well known to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor .
melville	moby	but ahab heard nothing ; for his own voice was high-lifted then ; and the boat leaped on . yet the voice spake true ; for scarce had he pushed from the ship , when numbers of sharks , seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath the hull , maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars , every time they dipped in the water ; and in this way accompanied the boat with their bites . it is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whale-boats in those swarming seas ; the sharks at times apparently following them in the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of marching regiments in the east . but these were the first sharks that had been observed by the pequod since the white whale had been first descried ; and whether it was that ahab ’ s crew were all such tiger-yellow barbarians , and therefore their flesh more musky to the senses of the sharks—a matter sometimes well known to affect them , —however it was , they seemed to follow that one boat without molesting the others .
melville	moby	started from his slumbers , ahab , face to face , saw the parsee ; and hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a flooded world . “ i have dreamed it again , ” said he .
melville	moby	i went down to supper . after sitting a long time listening to the long stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage , as they called it ( that is , a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or brig , confined to the north of the line , in the atlantic ocean only ) ; after listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven o ’ clock , i went up stairs to go to bed , feeling quite sure by this time queequeg must certainly have brought his ramadan to a termination . but no ; there he was just where i had left him ; he had not stirred an inch . i began to grow vexed with him ; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room , holding a piece of wood on his head .
melville	moby	chapter 62 . the dart . a word concerning an incident in the last chapter . according to the invariable usage of the fishery , the whale-boat pushes off from the ship , with the headsman or whale-killer as temporary steersman , and the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the foremost oar , the one known as the harpooneer-oar . now it needs a strong , nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish ; for often , in what is called a long dart , the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet . but however prolonged and exhausting the chase , the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost ; indeed , he is expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the rest , not only by incredible rowing , but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations ; and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one ’ s compass , while all the other muscles are strained and half started—what that is none know but those who have tried it . for one , i can not bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time . in this straining , bawling state , then , with his back to the fish , all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cry— “ stand up , and give it to him ! ” he now has to drop and secure his oar , turn round on his centre half way , seize his harpoon from the crotch , and with what little strength may remain , he essays to pitch it somehow into the whale . no wonder , taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body , that out of fifty fair chances for a dart , not five are successful ; no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated ; no wonder that some of them actually burst their blood-vessels in the boat ; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are absent four years with four barrels ; no wonder that to many ship owners , whaling is but a losing concern ; for it is the harpooneer that makes the voyage , and if you take the breath out of his body how can you expect to find it there when most wanted !
melville	moby	“ the sovereignest thing on earth is parmacetti for an inward bruise. ” —_king henry_ . “ very like a whale. ” —_hamlet_ . “ which to secure , no skill of leach ’ s art mote him availle , but to returne againe to his wound ’ s worker , that with lowly dart , dinting his breast , had bred his restless paine , like as the wounded whale to shore flies thro ’ the maine. ” —_the fairie queen_ .
melville	moby	these are the times , when in his whale-boat the rover softly feels a certain filial , confident , land-like feeling towards the sea ; that he regards it as so much flowery earth ; and the distant ship revealing only the tops of her masts , seems struggling forward , not through high rolling waves , but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie : as when the western emigrants ’ horses only show their erected ears , while their hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure .
melville	moby	“ look here , friend , ” said i , “ if you have anything important to tell us , out with it ; but if you are only trying to bamboozle us , you are mistaken in your game ; that ’ s all i have to say . ”
melville	moby	but , peradventure , it may be sagaciously urged , how is this ? we thought the tissued , infiltrated head of the sperm whale , was the lightest and most corky part about him ; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of a far greater specific gravity than itself . we have thee there . not at all , but i have ye ; for at the time poor tash fell in , the case had been nearly emptied of its lighter contents , leaving little but the dense tendinous wall of the well—a double welded , hammered substance , as i have before said , much heavier than the sea water , and a lump of which sinks in it like lead almost . but the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance was in the present instance materially counteracted by the other parts of the head remaining undetached from it , so that it sank very slowly and deliberately indeed , affording queequeg a fair chance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run , as you may say . yes , it was a running delivery , so it was .
melville	moby	i was a little staggered , but go a-whaling i must , and i would ; and the pequod was as good a ship as any—i thought the best—and all this i now repeated to peleg . seeing me so determined , he expressed his willingness to ship me .
melville	moby	“ oh , boy , nor will i thee , unless i should thereby drag thee to worse horrors than are here . come , then , to my cabin . lo ! ye believers in gods all goodness , and in man all ill , lo you ! see the omniscient gods oblivious of suffering man ; and man , though idiotic , and knowing not what he does , yet full of the sweet things of love and gratitude . come ! i feel prouder leading thee by thy black hand , than though i grasped an emperor ’ s ! ”
melville	moby	“ wish , by gor ! whale eat him , ’ stead of him eat whale . i ’ m bressed if he ain ’ t more of shark dan massa shark hisself , ” muttered the old man , limping away ; with which sage ejaculation he went to his hammock .
melville	moby	chapter 40 . midnight , forecastle . harpooneers and sailors . ( _foresail rises and discovers the watch standing , lounging , leaning , and lying in various attitudes , all singing in chorus_ . ) farewell and adieu to you , spanish ladies ! farewell and adieu to you , ladies of spain ! our captain ’ s commanded.—
melville	moby	nor , at the time , had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind , that all the anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of a former woe ; and he too plainly seemed to see , that as the most poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as the sweetest songster of the grove ; so , equally with every felicity , all miserable events do naturally beget their like . yea , more than equally , thought ahab ; since both the ancestry and posterity of grief go further than the ancestry and posterity of joy . for , not to hint of this : that it is an inference from certain canonic teachings , that while some natural enjoyments here shall have no children born to them for the other world , but , on the contrary , shall be followed by the joy-childlessness of all hell ’ s despair ; whereas , some guilty mortal miseries shall still fertilely beget to themselves an eternally progressive progeny of griefs beyond the grave ; not at all to hint of this , there still seems an inequality in the deeper analysis of the thing . for , thought ahab , while even the highest earthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them , but , at bottom , all heartwoes , a mystic significance , and , in some men , an archangelic grandeur ; so do their diligent tracings-out not belie the obvious deduction . to trail the genealogies of these high mortal miseries , carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of the gods ; so that , in the face of all the glad , hay-making suns , and soft cymballing , round harvest-moons , we must needs give in to this : that the gods themselves are not for ever glad . the ineffaceable , sad birth-mark in the brow of man , is but the stamp of sorrow in the signers .
melville	moby	“ go to bed berry soon , ” he mumbled , half-turning as he spoke . “ avast ! heave to ! i mean when you die , cook . it ’ s an awful question . now what ’ s your answer ? ” “ when dis old brack man dies , ” said the negro slowly , changing his whole air and demeanor , “ he hisself won ’ t go nowhere ; but some bressed angel will come and fetch him . ”
melville	moby	now , ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table in the pequod ’ s cabin . after their departure , taking place in inverted order to their arrival , the canvas cloth was cleared , or rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward . and then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast , they being its residuary legatees . they made a sort of temporary servants ’ hall of the high and mighty cabin .
melville	moby	chapter 92 . ambergris . now this ambergris is a very curious substance , and so important as an article of commerce , that in 1791 a certain nantucket-born captain coffin was examined at the bar of the english house of commons on that subject . for at that time , and indeed until a comparatively late day , the precise origin of ambergris remained , like amber itself , a problem to the learned . though the word ambergris is but the french compound for grey amber , yet the two substances are quite distinct . for amber , though at times found on the sea-coast , is also dug up in some far inland soils , whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea . besides , amber is a hard , transparent , brittle , odorless substance , used for mouth-pieces to pipes , for beads and ornaments ; but ambergris is soft , waxy , and so highly fragrant and spicy , that it is largely used in perfumery , in pastiles , precious candles , hair-powders , and pomatum . the turks use it in cooking , and also carry it to mecca , for the same purpose that frankincense is carried to st. peter ’ s in rome . some wine merchants drop a few grains into claret , to flavor it .
melville	moby	“ pull , pull , my good boys , ” said starbuck , in the lowest possible but intensest concentrated whisper to his men ; while the sharp fixed glance from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow , almost seemed as two visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses . he did not say much to his crew , though , nor did his crew say anything to him . only the silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar whispers , now harsh with command , now soft with entreaty .
melville	moby	“ what ’ s the matter with you , young man ? ” “ get the axe ! for god ’ s sake , run for the doctor , some one , while i pry it open ! ” “ look here , ” said the landlady , quickly putting down the vinegar-cruet , so as to have one hand free ; “ look here ; are you talking about prying open any of my doors ? ” —and with that she seized my arm . “ what ’ s the matter with you ? what ’ s the matter with you , shipmate ? ”
melville	moby	but there were still other and more vital practical influences at work . not even at the present day has the original prestige of the sperm whale , as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the leviathan , died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body . there are those this day among them , who , though intelligent and courageous enough in offering battle to the greenland or right whale , would perhaps—either from professional inexperience , or incompetency , or timidity , decline a contest with the sperm whale ; at any rate , there are plenty of whalemen , especially among those whaling nations not sailing under the american flag , who have never hostilely encountered the sperm whale , but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the north ; seated on their hatches , these men will hearken with a childish fireside interest and awe , to the wild , strange tales of southern whaling . nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the great sperm whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended , than on board of those prows which stem him .
melville	moby	among many other fine qualities , my royal friend tranquo , being gifted with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu , had brought together in pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his people could invent ; chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices , chiselled shells , inlaid spears , costly paddles , aromatic canoes ; and all these distributed among whatever natural wonders , the wonder-freighted , tribute-rendering waves had cast upon his shores .
melville	moby	“ well done , old fleece ! ” cried stubb , “ that ’ s christianity ; go on. ” “ no use goin ’ on ; de dam willains will keep a scougin ’ and slappin ’ each oder , massa stubb ; dey don ’ t hear one word ; no use a-preachin ’ to such dam g ’ uttons as you call ’ em , till dare bellies is full , and dare bellies is bottomless ; and when dey do get ’ em full , dey wont hear you den ; for den dey sink in de sea , go fast to sleep on de coral , and can ’ t hear not ’ ing at all , no more , for eber and eber . ”
melville	moby	now this doubloon was of purest , virgin gold , raked somewhere out of the heart of gorgeous hills , whence , east and west , over golden sands , the head-waters of many a pactolus flows . and though now nailed amidst all the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes , yet , untouchable and immaculate to any foulness , it still preserved its quito glow . nor , though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands , and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach , nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last . for it was set apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end ; and however wanton in their sailor ways , one and all , the mariners revered it as the white whale ’ s talisman . sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night , wondering whose it was to be at last , and whether he would ever live to spend it .
melville	moby	“ but no bones broken , sir , i hope , ” said stubb with true concern . “ aye ! and all splintered to pieces , stubb ! —d ’ ye see it.—but even with a broken bone , old ahab is untouched ; and i account no living bone of mine one jot more me , than this dead one that ’ s lost . nor white whale , nor man , nor fiend , can so much as graze old ahab in his own proper and inaccessible being . can any lead touch yonder floor , any mast scrape yonder roof ? —aloft there ! which way ? ”
melville	moby	at last , when the ship drew near to the outskirts , as it were , of the equatorial fishing-ground , and in the deep darkness that goes before the dawn , was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets ; the watch—then headed by flask—was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and unearthly—like half-articulated wailings of the ghosts of all herod ’ s murdered innocents—that one and all , they started from their reveries , and for the space of some moments stood , or sat , or leaned all transfixedly listening , like the carved roman slave , while that wild cry remained within hearing . the christian or civilized part of the crew said it was mermaids , and shuddered ; but the pagan harpooneers remained unappalled . yet the grey manxman—the oldest mariner of all—declared that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard , were the voices of newly drowned men in the sea .
melville	moby	book i . ( _folio_ ) , chapter ii . ( _right whale_ ) .—in one respect this is the most venerable of the leviathans , being the one first regularly hunted by man . it yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen ; and the oil specially known as “ whale oil , ” an inferior article in commerce . among the fishermen , he is indiscriminately designated by all the following titles : the whale ; the greenland whale ; the black whale ; the great whale ; the true whale ; the right whale . there is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously baptised . what then is the whale , which i include in the second species of my folios ? it is the great mysticetus of the english naturalists ; the greenland whale of the english whalemen ; the baleine ordinaire of the french whalemen ; the growlands walfish of the swedes . it is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the dutch and english in the arctic seas ; it is the whale which the american fishermen have long pursued in the indian ocean , on the brazil banks , on the nor ’ west coast , and various other parts of the world , designated by them right whale cruising grounds .
melville	moby	but as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the sledge-hammering seas , the before whale-smitten bow-ends of two planks burst through , and in an instant almost , the temporarily disabled boat lay nearly level with the waves ; its half-wading , splashing crew , trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water .
melville	moby	“ there ’ s another rendering now ; but still one text . all sorts of men in one kind of world , you see . dodge again ! here comes queequeg—all tattooing—looks like the signs of the zodiac himself . what says the cannibal ? as i live he ’ s comparing notes ; looking at his thigh bone ; thinks the sun is in the thigh , or in the calf , or in the bowels , i suppose , as the old women talk surgeon ’ s astronomy in the back country . and by jove , he ’ s found something there in the vicinity of his thigh—i guess it ’ s sagittarius , or the archer . no : he don ’ t know what to make of the doubloon ; he takes it for an old button off some king ’ s trowsers . but , aside again ! here comes that ghost-devil , fedallah ; tail coiled out of sight as usual , oakum in the toes of his pumps as usual . what does he say , with that look of his ? ah , only makes a sign to the sign and bows himself ; there is a sun on the coin—fire worshipper , depend upon it . ho ! more and more . this way comes pip—poor boy ! would he had died , or i ; he ’ s half horrible to me . he too has been watching all of these interpreters—myself included—and look now , he comes to read , with that unearthly idiot face . stand away again and hear him . hark ! ”
melville	moby	nippers . strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale ’ s vocabulary . but as applied by whalemen , it becomes so . a whaleman ’ s nipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of leviathan ’ s tail : it averages an inch in thickness , and for the rest , is about the size of the iron part of a hoe . edgewise moved along the oily deck , it operates like a leathern squilgee ; and by nameless blandishments , as of magic , allures along with it all impurities .
melville	moby	“ no , no , no ; i wasn ’ t aware of that , ” said elijah , slowly and wonderingly looking from me to queequeg , with the most unaccountable glances . “ elijah , ” said i , “ you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing . we are going to the indian and pacific oceans , and would prefer not to be detained . ”
melville	moby	“ come down , come down ! ” yelled the seamen to daggoo , but with one hand holding on to the heavy tackles , so that if the head should drop , he would still remain suspended ; the negro having cleared the foul line , rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well , meaning that the buried harpooneer should grasp it , and so be hoisted out .
melville	moby	but the third emir , now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck , seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint ; for , tipping all sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions , and kicking off his shoes , he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the grand turk ’ s head ; and then , by a dexterous sleight , pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf , he goes down rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck , reversing all other processions , by bringing up the rear with music . but ere stepping into the cabin doorway below , he pauses , ships a new face altogether , and , then , independent , hilarious little flask enters king ahab ’ s presence , in the character of abjectus , or the slave .
melville	moby	oh , immortal infancy , and innocency of the azure ! invisible winged creatures that frolic all round us ! sweet childhood of air and sky ! how oblivious were ye of old ahab ’ s close-coiled woe ! but so have i seen little miriam and martha , laughing-eyed elves , heedlessly gambol around their old sire ; sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on the marge of that burnt-out crater of his brain .
melville	moby	nor was it his unwonted magnitude , nor his remarkable hue , nor yet his deformed lower jaw , that so much invested the whale with natural terror , as that unexampled , intelligent malignity which , according to specific accounts , he had over and over again evinced in his assaults . more than all , his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught else . for , when swimming before his exulting pursuers , with every apparent symptom of alarm , he had several times been known to turn round suddenly , and , bearing down upon them , either stave their boats to splinters , or drive them back in consternation to their ship .
melville	moby	stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from the captain ’ s round-house abaft ; and looking in that direction saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door , which was held ajar from within . this was the tormented surgeon , who , after in vain remonstrating against the proceedings of the day , had betaken himself to the captain ’ s round-house ( _cabinet_ he called it ) to avoid the pest ; but still , could not help yelling out his entreaties and indignations at times .
melville	moby	the three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed , and a storm-trysail was set further aft ; so that the ship soon went through the water with some precision again ; and the course—for the present , east-south-east—which he was to steer , if practicable , was once more given to the helmsman . for during the violence of the gale , he had only steered according to its vicissitudes . but as he was now bringing the ship as near her course as possible , watching the compass meanwhile , lo ! a good sign ! the wind seemed coming round astern ; aye , the foul breeze became fair !
melville	moby	who would think , then , that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick whale ! yet so it is . by some , ambergris is supposed to be the cause , and by others the effect , of the dyspepsia in the whale . how to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say , unless by administering three or four boat loads of brandreth ’ s pills , and then running out of harm ’ s way , as laborers do in blasting rocks .
melville	moby	like noiseless nautilus shells , their light prows sped through the sea ; but only slowly they neared the foe . as they neared him , the ocean grew still more smooth ; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves ; seemed a noon-meadow , so serenely it spread . at length the breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey , that his entire dazzling hump was distinctly visible , sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing , and continually set in a revolving ring of finest , fleecy , greenish foam . he saw the vast , involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head beyond . before it , far out on the soft turkish-rugged waters , went the glistening white shadow from his broad , milky forehead , a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade ; and behind , the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake ; and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side . but these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea , alternate with their fitful flight ; and like to some flag-staff rising from the painted hull of an argosy , the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale ’ s back ; and at intervals one of the cloud of soft-toed fowls hovering , and to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish , silently perched and rocked on this pole , the long tail feathers streaming like pennons .
melville	moby	the waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whale ’ s spout-hole ; and the lantern hanging from its top , cast a troubled flickering glare upon the black , glossy back , and far out upon the midnight waves , which gently chafed the whale ’ s broad flank , like soft surf upon a beach .
melville	moby	in summer time , the town is sweet to see ; full of fine maples—long avenues of green and gold . and in august , high in air , the beautiful and bountiful horse-chestnuts , candelabra-wise , proffer the passer-by their tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms . so omnipotent is art ; which in many a district of new bedford has superinduced bright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creation ’ s final day .
melville	moby	it were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was , that as respecting starbuck , ahab thus acted . it may have been a flash of honesty in him ; or mere prudential policy which , under the circumstance , imperiously forbade the slightest symptom of open disaffection , however transient , in the important chief officer of his ship . however it was , his orders were executed ; and the burtons were hoisted .
melville	moby	it is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense artificialness of sea-usages , that while in the open air of the deck some officers will , upon provocation , bear themselves boldly and defyingly enough towards their commander ; yet , ten to one , let those very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that same commander ’ s cabin , and straightway their inoffensive , not to say deprecatory and humble air towards him , as he sits at the head of the table ; this is marvellous , sometimes most comical . wherefore this difference ? a problem ? perhaps not . to have been belshazzar , king of babylon ; and to have been belshazzar , not haughtily but courteously , therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur . but he who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own private dinner-table of invited guests , that man ’ s unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for the time ; that man ’ s royalty of state transcends belshazzar ’ s , for belshazzar was not the greatest . who has but once dined his friends , has tasted what it is to be cæsar . it is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding . now , if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a ship-master , then , by inference , you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of sea-life just mentioned .

melville	moby	as i walked away , i was full of thoughtfulness ; what had been incidentally revealed to me of captain ahab , filled me with a certain wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him . and somehow , at the time , i felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him , but for i don ’ t know what , unless it was the cruel loss of his leg . and yet i also felt a strange awe of him ; but that sort of awe , which i can not at all describe , was not exactly awe ; i do not know what it was . but i felt it ; and it did not disincline me towards him ; though i felt impatience at what seemed like mystery in him , so imperfectly as he was known to me then . however , my thoughts were at length carried in other directions , so that for the present dark ahab slipped my mind .
melville	moby	who garnery the painter is , or was , i know not . but my life for it he was either practically conversant with his subject , or else marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman . the french are the lads for painting action . go and gaze upon all the paintings of europe , and where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing commotion on canvas , as in that triumphal hall at versailles ; where the beholder fights his way , pell-mell , through the consecutive great battles of france ; where every sword seems a flash of the northern lights , and the successive armed kings and emperors dash by , like a charge of crowned centaurs ? not wholly unworthy of a place in that gallery , are these sea battle-pieces of garnery .

melville	moby	ere forgetfulness altogether came over me , i had noticed that the seamen at the main and mizzen-mast-heads were already drowsy . so that at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars , and for every swing that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering helmsman . the waves , too , nodded their indolent crests ; and across the wide trance of the sea , east nodded to west , and the sun over all .
melville	moby	“ damn him , cut ! ” roared stubb ; and so the whale was lost and pip was saved . so soon as he recovered himself , the poor little negro was assailed by yells and execrations from the crew . tranquilly permitting these irregular cursings to evaporate , stubb then in a plain , business-like , but still half humorous manner , cursed pip officially ; and that done , unofficially gave him much wholesome advice . the substance was , never jump from a boat , pip , except—but all the rest was indefinite , as the soundest advice ever is . now , in general , _stick to the boat_ , is your true motto in whaling ; but cases will sometimes happen when _leap from the boat_ , is still better . moreover , as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted conscientious advice to pip , he would be leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future ; stubb suddenly dropped all advice , and concluded with a peremptory command , “ stick to the boat , pip , or by the lord , i won ’ t pick you up if you jump ; mind that . we can ’ t afford to lose whales by the likes of you ; a whale would sell for thirty times what you would , pip , in alabama . bear that in mind , and don ’ t jump any more. ” hereby perhaps stubb indirectly hinted , that though man loved his fellow , yet man is a money-making animal , which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence .

melville	moby	“ ‘ lakeman ! —buffalo ! pray , what is a lakeman , and where is buffalo ? ’ said don sebastian , rising in his swinging mat of grass . “ on the eastern shore of our lake erie , don ; but—i crave your courtesy—may be , you shall soon hear further of all that . now , gentlemen , in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships , well-nigh as large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old callao to far manilla ; this lakeman , in the land-locked heart of our america , had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly connected with the open ocean . for in their interflowing aggregate , those grand fresh-water seas of ours , —erie , and ontario , and huron , and superior , and michigan , —possess an ocean-like expansiveness , with many of the ocean ’ s noblest traits ; with many of its rimmed varieties of races and of climes . they contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles , even as the polynesian waters do ; in large part , are shored by two great contrasting nations , as the atlantic is ; they furnish long maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the east , dotted all round their banks ; here and there are frowned upon by batteries , and by the goat-like craggy guns of lofty mackinaw ; they have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories ; at intervals , they yield their beaches to wild barbarians , whose red painted faces flash from out their peltry wigwams ; for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered forests , where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in gothic genealogies ; those same woods harboring wild afric beasts of prey , and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to tartar emperors ; they mirror the paved capitals of buffalo and cleveland , as well as winnebago villages ; they float alike the full-rigged merchant ship , the armed cruiser of the state , the steamer , and the beech canoe ; they are swept by borean and dismasting blasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave ; they know what shipwrecks are , for out of sight of land , however inland , they have drowned full many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew . thus , gentlemen , though an inlander , steelkilt was wild-ocean born , and wild-ocean nurtured ; as much of an audacious mariner as any . and for radney , though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone nantucket beach , to nurse at his maternal sea ; though in after life he had long followed our austere atlantic and your contemplative pacific ; yet was he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman , fresh from the latitudes of buck-horn handled bowie-knives . yet was this nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits ; and this lakeman , a mariner , who though a sort of devil indeed , might yet by inflexible firmness , only tempered by that common decency of human recognition which is the meanest slave ’ s right ; thus treated , this steelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile . at all events , he had proved so thus far ; but radney was doomed and made mad , and steelkilt—but , gentlemen , you shall hear .
melville	moby	so seemed it to me , as i stood at her helm , and for long hours silently guided the way of this fire-ship on the sea . wrapped , for that interval , in darkness myself , i but the better saw the redness , the madness , the ghastliness of others . the continual sight of the fiend shapes before me , capering half in smoke and half in fire , these at last begat kindred visions in my soul , so soon as i began to yield to that unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over me at a midnight helm .

melville	moby	it was not very long after speaking the goney that another homeward-bound whaleman , the town-ho , * was encountered . she was manned almost wholly by polynesians . in the short gam that ensued she gave us strong news of moby dick . to some the general interest in the white whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the town-ho ’ s story , which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain wondrous , inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of god which at times are said to overtake some men . this latter circumstance , with its own particular accompaniments , forming what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated , never reached the ears of captain ahab or his mates . for that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of the town-ho himself . it was the private property of three confederate white seamen of that ship , one of whom , it seems , communicated it to tashtego with romish injunctions of secrecy , but the following night tashtego rambled in his sleep , and revealed so much of it in that way , that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest . nevertheless , so potent an influence did this thing have on those seamen in the pequod who came to the full knowledge of it , and by such a strange delicacy , to call it so , were they governed in this matter , that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never transpired abaft the pequod ’ s main-mast . interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the ship , the whole of this strange affair i now proceed to put on lasting record .
melville	moby	epilogue “ and i only am escaped alone to tell thee ” job . the drama ’ s done . why then here does any one step forth ? —because one did survive the wreck . it so chanced , that after the parsee ’ s disappearance , i was he whom the fates ordained to take the place of ahab ’ s bowsman , when that bowsman assumed the vacant post ; the same , who , when on the last day the three men were tossed from out of the rocking boat , was dropped astern . so , floating on the margin of the ensuing scene , and in full sight of it , when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me , i was then , but slowly , drawn towards the closing vortex . when i reached it , it had subsided to a creamy pool . round and round , then , and ever contracting towards the button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle , like another ixion i did revolve . till , gaining that vital centre , the black bubble upward burst ; and now , liberated by reason of its cunning spring , and , owing to its great buoyancy , rising with great force , the coffin life-buoy shot lengthwise from the sea , fell over , and floated by my side . buoyed up by that coffin , for almost one whole day and night , i floated on a soft and dirgelike main . the unharming sharks , they glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths ; the savage sea-hawks sailed with sheathed beaks . on the second day , a sail drew near , nearer , and picked me up at last . it was the devious-cruising rachel , that in her retracing search after her missing children , only found another orphan .

melville	moby	meantime , fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale ’ s head , and ever and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own hand . and ahab chanced so to stand , that the parsee occupied his shadow ; while , if the parsee ’ s shadow was there at all it seemed only to blend with , and lengthen ahab ’ s . as the crew toiled on , laplandish speculations were bandied among them , concerning all these passing things .
melville	moby	but so decided an original start had derick had , that spite of all their gallantry , he would have proved the victor in this race , had not a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade of his midship oarsman . while this clumsy lubber was striving to free his white-ash , and while , in consequence , derick ’ s boat was nigh to capsizing , and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage ; —that was a good time for starbuck , stubb , and flask . with a shout , they took a mortal start forwards , and slantingly ranged up on the german ’ s quarter . an instant more , and all four boats were diagonically in the whale ’ s immediate wake , while stretching from them , on both sides , was the foaming swell that he made .
melville	moby	“ depend upon it , landlord , that harpooneer is a dangerous man. ” “ he pays reg ’ lar , ” was the rejoinder . “ but come , it ’ s getting dreadful late , you had better be turning flukes—it ’ s a nice bed ; sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced . there ’ s plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed ; it ’ s an almighty big bed that . why , afore we give it up , sal used to put our sam and little johnny in the foot of it . but i got a dreaming and sprawling about one night , and somehow , sam got pitched on the floor , and came near breaking his arm . arter that , sal said it wouldn ’ t do . come along here , i ’ ll give ye a glim in a jiffy ; ” and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me , offering to lead the way . but i stood irresolute ; when looking at a clock in the corner , he exclaimed “ i vum it ’ s sunday—you won ’ t see that harpooneer to-night ; he ’ s come to anchor somewhere—come along then ; _do_ come ; _won ’ t_ ye come ? ”
melville	moby	the chance comparison in this chapter , between the whale and the elephant , so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk of the other are concerned , should not tend to place those two opposite organs on an equality , much less the creatures to which they respectively belong . for as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to leviathan , so , compared with leviathan ’ s tail , his trunk is but the stalk of a lily . the most direful blow from the elephant ’ s trunk were as the playful tap of a fan , compared with the measureless crush and crash of the sperm whale ’ s ponderous flukes , which in repeated instances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their oars and crews into the air , very much as an indian juggler tosses his balls . *
melville	moby	* this motion is peculiar to the sperm whale . it receives its designation ( pitchpoling ) from its being likened to that preliminary up-and-down poise of the whale-lance , in the exercise called pitchpoling , previously described . by this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling him .
melville	moby	“ it is generally well known that out of the crews of whaling vessels ( american ) few ever return in the ships on board of which they departed. ” —_cruise in a whale boat_ .
melville	moby	upon this , he told me another story . the people of his island of rokovoko , it seems , at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl ; and this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held . now a certain grand merchant ship once touched at rokovoko , and its commander—from all accounts , a very stately punctilious gentleman , at least for a sea captain—this commander was invited to the wedding feast of queequeg ’ s sister , a pretty young princess just turned of ten . well ; when all the wedding guests were assembled at the bride ’ s bamboo cottage , this captain marches in , and being assigned the post of honor , placed himself over against the punchbowl , and between the high priest and his majesty the king , queequeg ’ s father . grace being said , —for those people have their grace as well as we—though queequeg told me that unlike us , who at such times look downwards to our platters , they , on the contrary , copying the ducks , glance upwards to the great giver of all feasts—grace , i say , being said , the high priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island ; that is , dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates . seeing himself placed next the priest , and noting the ceremony , and thinking himself—being captain of a ship—as having plain precedence over a mere island king , especially in the king ’ s own house—the captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowl ; —taking it i suppose for a huge finger-glass . “ now , ” said queequeg , “ what you tink now ? —didn ’ t our people laugh ? ”
melville	moby	now when these poor sun-burnt mariners , bare-footed , and with their trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs , had wearily hauled their fat fish high and dry , promising themselves a good £150 from the precious oil and bone ; and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their wives , and good ale with their cronies , upon the strength of their respective shares ; up steps a very learned and most christian and charitable gentleman , with a copy of blackstone under his arm ; and laying it upon the whale ’ s head , he says— “ hands off ! this fish , my masters , is a fast-fish . i seize it as the lord warden ’ s. ” upon this the poor mariners in their respectful consternation—so truly english—knowing not what to say , fall to vigorously scratching their heads all round ; meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the stranger . but that did in nowise mend the matter , or at all soften the hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of blackstone . at length one of them , after long scratching about for his ideas , made bold to speak ,
melville	moby	“ pull up—pull up ! ” he now cried to the bowsman , as the waning whale relaxed in his wrath . “ pull up ! —close to ! ” and the boat ranged along the fish ’ s flank . when reaching far over the bow , stubb slowly churned his long sharp lance into the fish , and kept it there , carefully churning and churning , as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed , and which he was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out . but that gold watch he sought was the innermost life of the fish . and now it is struck ; for , starting from his trance into that unspeakable thing called his “ flurry , ” the monster horribly wallowed in his blood , overwrapped himself in impenetrable , mad , boiling spray , so that the imperilled craft , instantly dropping astern , had much ado blindly to struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day .

melville	moby	the question is , what and where is the skin of the whale ? already you know what his blubber is . that blubber is something of the consistence of firm , close-grained beef , but tougher , more elastic and compact , and ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness .
melville	moby	nor , in quite other aspects , does nature in her least palpable but not the less malicious agencies , fail to enlist among her forces this crowning attribute of the terrible . from its snowy aspect , the gauntleted ghost of the southern seas has been denominated the white squall . nor , in some historic instances , has the art of human malice omitted so potent an auxiliary . how wildly it heightens the effect of that passage in froissart , when , masked in the snowy symbol of their faction , the desperate white hoods of ghent murder their bailiff in the market-place !

melville	moby	thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils , twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction . all the oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions ; so that to the timid eye of the landsman , they seem as indian jugglers , with the deadliest snakes sportively festooning their limbs . nor can any son of mortal woman , for the first time , seat himself amid those hempen intricacies , and while straining his utmost at the oar , bethink him that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted , and all these horrible contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings ; he can not be thus circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly . yet habit—strange thing ! what can not habit accomplish ? —gayer sallies , more merry mirth , better jokes , and brighter repartees , you never heard over your mahogany , than you will hear over the half-inch white cedar of the whale-boat , when thus hung in hangman ’ s nooses ; and , like the six burghers of calais before king edward , the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of death , with a halter around every neck , as you may say .

melville	moby	“ peace , thou crazy loon , ” cried the manxman , seizing him by the arm . “ away from the quarter-deck ! ” “ the greater idiot ever scolds the lesser , ” muttered ahab , advancing . “ hands off from that holiness ! where sayest thou pip was , boy ?

melville	moby	for all these reasons , then , any way you may look at it , you must needs conclude that the great leviathan is that one creature in the world which must remain unpainted to the last . true , one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another , but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness . so there is no earthly way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like . and the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour , is by going a whaling yourself ; but by so doing , you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him . wherefore , it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this leviathan .
melville	moby	“ mean or not mean , here we are at the ship. ” the boats were here hailed , to tow the whale on the larboard side , where fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for securing him .
melville	moby	nevertheless , it may well be believed that since they have such a ravenous finger in the pie , it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them . accordingly , besides the monkey-rope , with which i now and then jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark—he was provided with still another protection . suspended over the side in one of the stages , tashtego and daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen whale-spades , wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could reach . this procedure of theirs , to be sure , was very disinterested and benevolent of them . they meant queequeg ’ s best happiness , i admit ; but in their hasty zeal to befriend him , and from the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood-muddled water , those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a tail . but poor queequeg , i suppose , straining and gasping there with that great iron hook—poor queequeg , i suppose , only prayed to his yojo , and gave up his life into the hands of his gods .
melville	moby	it seems that some honest mariners of dover , or sandwich , or some one of the cinque ports , had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and beaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from the shore . now the cinque ports are partially or somehow under the jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle , called a lord warden . holding the office directly from the crown , i believe , all the royal emoluments incident to the cinque port territories become by assignment his . by some writers this office is called a sinecure . but not so . because the lord warden is busily employed at times in fobbing his perquisites ; which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of them .
melville	moby	a sag harbor ship visited his father ’ s bay , and queequeg sought a passage to christian lands . but the ship , having her full complement of seamen , spurned his suit ; and not all the king his father ’ s influence could prevail . but queequeg vowed a vow . alone in his canoe , he paddled off to a distant strait , which he knew the ship must pass through when she quitted the island . on one side was a coral reef ; on the other a low tongue of land , covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the water . hiding his canoe , still afloat , among these thickets , with its prow seaward , he sat down in the stern , paddle low in hand ; and when the ship was gliding by , like a flash he darted out ; gained her side ; with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe ; climbed up the chains ; and throwing himself at full length upon the deck , grappled a ring-bolt there , and swore not to let it go , though hacked in pieces .
melville	moby	“ am i a cannon-ball , stubb , ” said ahab , “ that thou wouldst wad me that fashion ? but go thy ways ; i had forgot . below to thy nightly grave ; where such as ye sleep between shrouds , to use ye to the filling one at last.—down , dog , and kennel ! ”
melville	moby	this is much ; yet ahab ’ s larger , darker , deeper part remains unhinted . but vain to popularize profundities , and all truth is profound . winding far down from within the very heart of this spiked hotel de cluny where we here stand—however grand and wonderful , now quit it ; —and take your way , ye nobler , sadder souls , to those vast roman halls of thermes ; where far beneath the fantastic towers of man ’ s upper earth , his root of grandeur , his whole awful essence sits in bearded state ; an antique buried beneath antiquities , and throned on torsoes ! so with a broken throne , the great gods mock that captive king ; so like a caryatid , he patient sits , upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages . wind ye down there , ye prouder , sadder souls ! question that proud , sad king ! a family likeness ! aye , he did beget ye , ye young exiled royalties ; and from your grim sire only will the old state-secret come .
melville	moby	chapter 27 . knights and squires . stubb was the second mate . he was a native of cape cod ; and hence , according to local usage , was called a cape-cod-man . a happy-go-lucky ; neither craven nor valiant ; taking perils as they came with an indifferent air ; and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the chase , toiling away , calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged for the year . good-humored , easy , and careless , he presided over his whale-boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner , and his crew all invited guests . he was as particular about the comfortable arrangement of his part of the boat , as an old stage-driver is about the snugness of his box . when close to the whale , in the very death-lock of the fight , he handled his unpitying lance coolly and off-handedly , as a whistling tinker his hammer . he would hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperated monster . long usage had , for this stubb , converted the jaws of death into an easy chair . what he thought of death itself , there is no telling . whether he ever thought of it at all , might be a question ; but , if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a comfortable dinner , no doubt , like a good sailor , he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft , and bestir themselves there , about something which he would find out when he obeyed the order , and not sooner .
melville	moby	without saying a word , queequeg , in his wild sort of way , jumped upon the bulwarks , from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats hanging to the side ; and then bracing his left knee , and poising his harpoon , cried out in some such way as this : —
melville	moby	and , indeed , it seemed small matter for wonder , that for all his pervading , mad recklessness , ahab did at times give careful heed to the condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood . for it had not been very long prior to the pequod ’ s sailing from nantucket , that he had been found one night lying prone upon the ground , and insensible ; by some unknown , and seemingly inexplicable , unimaginable casualty , his ivory limb having been so violently displaced , that it had stake-wise smitten , and all but pierced his groin ; nor was it without extreme difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured .

melville	moby	* since the above was written , the statement is happily borne out by an official circular , issued by lieutenant maury , of the national observatory , washington , april 16th , 1851 . by that circular , it appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion ; and portions of it are presented in the circular . “ this chart divides the ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude ; perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve columns for the twelve months ; and horizontally through each of which districts are three lines ; one to show the number of days that have been spent in each month in every district , and the two others to show the number of days in which whales , sperm or right , have been seen . ”
melville	moby	chapter 102 . a bower in the arsacides . hitherto , in descriptively treating of the sperm whale , i have chiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect ; or separately and in detail upon some few interior structural features . but to a large and thorough sweeping comprehension of him , it behooves me now to unbutton him still further , and untagging the points of his hose , unbuckling his garters , and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost bones , set him before you in his ultimatum ; that is to say , in his unconditional skeleton .
melville	moby	in considering these ribs , i could not but be struck anew with the circumstance , so variously repeated in this book , that the skeleton of the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form . the largest of the tranque ribs , one of the middle ones , occupied that part of the fish which , in life , is greatest in depth . now , the greatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen feet ; whereas , the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight feet . so that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the living magnitude of that part . besides , for some way , where i now saw but a naked spine , all that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh , muscle , blood , and bowels . still more , for the ample fins , i here saw but a few disordered joints ; and in place of the weighty and majestic , but boneless flukes , an utter blank !
melville	moby	with halting steps i paced the streets , and passed the sign of “ the crossed harpoons ” —but it looked too expensive and jolly there . further on , from the bright red windows of the “ sword-fish inn , ” there came such fervent rays , that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house , for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard , asphaltic pavement , —rather weary for me , when i struck my foot against the flinty projections , because from hard , remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight . too expensive and jolly , again thought i , pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the street , and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within . but go on , ishmael , said i at last ; don ’ t you hear ? get away from before the door ; your patched boots are stopping the way . so on i went . i now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward , for there , doubtless , were the cheapest , if not the cheeriest inns .
melville	moby	“ it was he , it was he ! ” cried ahab , suddenly letting out his suspended breath . “ and harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin. ” “ aye , aye—they were mine—_my_ irons , ” cried ahab , exultingly— “ but on ! ”

melville	moby	the four boats were soon on the water ; ahab ’ s in advance , and all swiftly pulling towards their prey . soon it went down , and while , with oars suspended , we were awaiting its reappearance , lo ! in the same spot where it sank , once more it slowly rose . almost forgetting for the moment all thoughts of moby dick , we now gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind . a vast pulpy mass , furlongs in length and breadth , of a glancing cream-colour , lay floating on the water , innumerable long arms radiating from its centre , and curling and twisting like a nest of anacondas , as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach . no perceptible face or front did it have ; no conceivable token of either sensation or instinct ; but undulated there on the billows , an unearthly , formless , chance-like apparition of life .
melville	moby	“ ‘ will you promise not to touch us , if we do ? ’ demanded their ringleader . “ ‘ turn to ! turn to ! —i make no promise ; —to your duty ! do you want to sink the ship , by knocking off at a time like this ? turn to ! ’ and he once more raised a pistol .
melville	moby	now in the present case erskine contended that the examples of the whale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other . these pleadings , and the counter pleadings , being duly heard , the very learned judge in set terms decided , to wit , —that as for the boat , he awarded it to the plaintiffs , because they had merely abandoned it to save their lives ; but that with regard to the controverted whale , harpoons , and line , they belonged to the defendants ; the whale , because it was a loose-fish at the time of the final capture ; and the harpoons and line because when the fish made off with them , it ( the fish ) acquired a property in those articles ; and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a right to them . now the defendants afterwards took the fish ; ergo , the aforesaid articles were theirs .
melville	typee	typee a romance of the south seas by herman melville preface more than three years have elapsed since the occurrence of the events recorded in this volume . the interval , with the exception of the last few months , has been chiefly spent by the author tossing about on the wide ocean . sailors are the only class of men who now-a-days see anything like stirring adventure ; and many things which to fire-side people appear strange and romantic , to them seem as common-place as a jacket out at elbows . yet , notwithstanding the familiarity of sailors with all sorts of curious adventure , the incidents recorded in the following pages have often served , when ‘ spun as a yarn , ’ not only to relieve the weariness of many a night-watch at sea , but to excite the warmest sympathies of the author ’ s shipmates . he has been , therefore , led to think that his story could scarcely fail to interest those who are less familiar than the sailor with a life of adventure .
melville	typee	in his account of the singular and interesting people among whom he was thrown , it will be observed that he chiefly treats of their more obvious peculiarities ; and , in describing their customs , refrains in most cases from entering into explanations concerning their origin and purposes . as writers of travels among barbarous communities are generally very diffuse on these subjects , he deems it right to advert to what may be considered a culpable omission . no one can be more sensible than the author of his deficiencies in this and many other respects ; but when the very peculiar circumstances in which he was placed are understood , he feels assured that all these omissions will be excused .
melville	typee	in very many published narratives no little degree of attention is bestowed upon dates ; but as the author lost all knowledge of the days of the week , during the occurrence of the scenes herein related , he hopes that the reader will charitably pass over his shortcomings in this particular .
melville	typee	in the polynesian words used in this volume , -- except in those cases where the spelling has been previously determined by others , -- that form of orthography has been employed , which might be supposed most easily to convey their sound to a stranger . in several works descriptive of the islands in the pacific , many of the most beautiful combinations of vocal sounds have been altogether lost to the ear of the reader by an over-attention to the ordinary rules of spelling .
melville	typee	there are a few passages in the ensuing chapters which may be thought to bear rather hard upon a reverend order of men , the account of whose proceedings in different quarters of the globe -- transmitted to us through their own hands -- very generally , and often very deservedly , receives high commendation . such passages will be found , however , to be based upon facts admitting of no contradiction , and which have come immediately under the writer ’ s cognizance . the conclusions deduced from these facts are unavoidable , and in stating them the author has been influenced by no feeling of animosity , either to the individuals themselves , or to that glorious cause which has not always been served by the proceedings of some of its advocates .
melville	typee	the great interest with which the important events lately occurring at the sandwich , marquesas , and society islands , have been regarded in america and england , and indeed throughout the world , will , he trusts , justify a few otherwise unwarrantable digressions .
melville	typee	there are some things related in the narrative which will be sure to appear strange , or perhaps entirely incomprehensible , to the reader ; but they can not appear more so to him than they did to the author at the time . he has stated such matters just as they occurred , and leaves every one to form his own opinion concerning them ; trusting that his anxious desire to speak the unvarnished truth will gain for him the confidence of his readers . 1846 .
melville	typee	introduction to the edition of 1892 by arthur stedman of the trinity of american authors whose births made the year 1819 a notable one in our literary history , -- lowell , whitman , and melville , -- it is interesting to observe that the two latter were both descended , on the fathers ’ and mothers ’ sides respectively , from have families of british new england and dutch new york extraction . whitman and van velsor , melville and gansevoort , were the several combinations which produced these men ; and it is easy to trace in the life and character of each author the qualities derived from his joint ancestry . here , however , the resemblance ceases , for whitman ’ s forebears , while worthy country people of good descent , were not prominent in public or private life . melville , on the other hand , was of distinctly patrician birth , his paternal and maternal grandfathers having been leading characters in the revolutionary war ; their descendants still maintaining a dignified social position .
melville	typee	allan melville , great-grandfather of herman melville , removed from scotland to america in 1748 , and established himself as a merchant in boston . his son , major thomas melville , was a leader in the famous ‘ boston tea party ’ of 1773 and afterwards became an officer in the continental army . he is reported to have been a conservative in all matters except his opposition to unjust taxation , and he wore the old-fashioned cocked hat and knee-breeches until his death , in 1832 , thus becoming the original of doctor holmes ’ s poem , ‘ the last leaf ’ . major melville ’ s son allan , the father of herman , was an importing merchant , -- first in boston , and later in new york . he was a man of much culture , and was an extensive traveller for his time . he married maria gansevoort , daughter of general peter gansevoort , best known as ‘ the hero of fort stanwix. ’ this fort was situated on the present site of rome , n.y. ; and there gansevoort , with a small body of men , held in check reinforcements on their way to join burgoyne , until the disastrous ending of the latter ’ s campaign of 1777 was insured . the gansevoorts , it should be said , were at that time and subsequently residents of albany , n.y .
melville	typee	herman melville was born in new york on august 1,1819 , and received his early education in that city . there he imbibed his first love of adventure , listening , as he says in ‘ redburn , ’ while his father ‘ of winter evenings , by the well-remembered sea-coal fire in old greenwich street , used to tell my brother and me of the monstrous waves at sea , mountain high , of the masts bending like twigs , and all about havre and liverpool. ’ the death of his father in reduced circumstances necessitated the removal of his mother and the family of eight brothers and sisters to the village of lansingburg , on the hudson river . there herman remained until 1835 , when he attended the albany classical school for some months . dr. charles e. west , the well-known brooklyn educator , was then in charge of the school , and remembers the lad ’ s deftness in english composition , and his struggles with mathematics .
melville	typee	the following year was passed at pittsfield , mass. , where he engaged in work on his uncle ’ s farm , long known as the ‘ van schaack place. ’ this uncle was thomas melville , president of the berkshire agricultural society , and a successful gentleman farmer .
melville	typee	herman ’ s roving disposition , and a desire to support himself independently of family assistance , soon led him to ship as cabin boy in a new york vessel bound for liverpool . he made the voyage , visited london , and returned in the same ship . ‘ redburn : his first voyage , ’ published in 1849 , is partly founded on the experiences of this trip , which was undertaken with the full consent of his relatives , and which seems to have satisfied his nautical ambition for a time . as told in the book , melville met with more than the usual hardships of a sailor-boy ’ s first venture . it does not seem difficult in ‘ redburn ’ to separate the author ’ s actual experiences from those invented by him , this being the case in some of his other writings .
melville	typee	a good part of the succeeding three years , from 1837 to 1840 , was occupied with school-teaching . while so engaged at greenbush , now east albany , n.y. , he received the munificent salary of ‘ six dollars a quarter and board. ’ he taught for one term at pittsfield , mass. , ‘ boarding around ’ with the families of his pupils , in true american fashion , and easily suppressing , on one memorable occasion , the efforts of his larger scholars to inaugurate a rebellion by physical force .
melville	typee	i fancy that it was the reading of richard henry dana ’ s ‘ two years before the mast ’ which revived the spirit of adventure in melville ’ s breast . that book was published in 1840 , and was at once talked of everywhere . melville must have read it at the time , mindful of his own experience as a sailor . at any rate , he once more signed a ship ’ s articles , and on january 1 , 1841 , sailed from new bedford harbour in the whaler acushnet , bound for the pacific ocean and the sperm fishery . he has left very little direct information as to the events of this eighteen months ’ cruise , although his whaling romance , ‘ moby dick ; or , the whale , ’ probably gives many pictures of life on board the acushnet . in the present volume he confines himself to a general account of the captain ’ s bad treatment of the crew , and of his non-fulfilment of agreements . under these considerations , melville decided to abandon the vessel on reaching the marquesas islands ; and the narrative of ‘ typee ’ begins at this point . however , he always recognised the immense influence the voyage had had upon his career , and in regard to its results has said in ‘ moby dick , ’ --
melville	typee	‘ if i shall ever deserve any real repute in that small but high hushed world which i might not be unreasonably ambitious of ; if hereafter i shall do anything that on the whole a man might rather have done than to have left undone ... then here i prospectively ascribe all the honour and the glory to whaling ; for a whale-ship was my yale college and my harvard . ’
melville	typee	the record , then , of melville ’ s escape from the dolly , otherwise the acushnet , the sojourn of his companion toby and himself in the typee valley on the island of nukuheva , toby ’ s mysterious disappearance , and melville ’ s own escape , is fully given in the succeeding pages ; and rash indeed would he be who would enter into a descriptive contest with these inimitable pictures of aboriginal life in the ‘ happy valley. ’ so great an interest has always centred in the character of toby , whose actual existence has been questioned , that i am glad to be able to declare him an authentic personage , by name richard t. greene . he was enabled to discover himself again to mr. melville through the publication of the present volume , and their acquaintance was renewed , lasting for quite a long period . i have seen his portrait , -- a rare old daguerrotype , -- and some of his letters to our author . one of his children was named for the latter , but mr. melville lost trace of him in recent years .
melville	typee	with the author ’ s rescue from what dr. t. m. coan has styled his ‘ anxious paradise , ’ ‘ typee ’ ends , and its sequel , ‘ omoo , ’ begins . here , again , it seems wisest to leave the remaining adventures in the south seas to the reader ’ s own discovery , simply stating that , after a sojourn at the society islands , melville shipped for honolulu . there he remained for four months , employed as a clerk . he joined the crew of the american frigate united states , which reached boston , stopping on the way at one of the peruvian ports , in october of 1844 . once more was a narrative of his experiences to be preserved in ‘ white jacket ; or , the world in a man-of-war. ’ thus , of melville ’ s four most important books , three , ‘ typee , ’ ‘ omoo , ’ and ‘ white-jacket , ’ are directly auto biographical , and ‘ moby dick ’ is partially so ; while the less important ‘ redburn ’ is between the two classes in this respect . melville ’ s other prose works , as will be shown , were , with some exceptions , unsuccessful efforts at creative romance .
melville	typee	whether our author entered on his whaling adventures in the south seas with a determination to make them available for literary purposes , may never be certainly known . there was no such elaborate announcement or advance preparation as in some later cases . i am inclined to believe that the literary prospect was an after-thought , and that this insured a freshness and enthusiasm of style not otherwise to be attained . returning to his mother ’ s home at lansingburg , melville soon began the writing of ‘ typee , ’ which was completed by the autumn of 1845 . shortly after this his older brother , gansevoort melville , sailed for england as secretary of legation to ambassador mclane , and the manuscript was intrusted to gansevoort for submission to john murray . its immediate acceptance and publication followed in 1846 . ‘ typee ’ was dedicated to chief justice lemuel shaw of massachusetts , an old friendship between the author ’ s family and that of justice shaw having been renewed about this time . mr. melville became engaged to miss elizabeth shaw , the only daughter of the chief justice , and their marriage followed on august 4 , 1847 , in boston .
melville	typee	the wanderings of our nautical othello were thus brought to a conclusion . mr. and mrs. melville resided in new york city until 1850 , when they purchased a farmhouse at pittsfield , their farm adjoining that formerly owned by mr. melville ’ s uncle , which had been inherited by the latter ’ s son . the new place was named ‘ arrow head , ’ from the numerous indian antiquities found in the neighbourhood . the house was so situated as to command an uninterrupted view of greylock mountain and the adjacent hills . here melville remained for thirteen years , occupied with his writing , and managing his farm . an article in putnam ’ s monthly entitled ‘ i and my chimney , ’ another called ‘ october mountain , ’ and the introduction to the ‘ piazza tales , ’ present faithful pictures of arrow head and its surroundings . in a letter to nathaniel hawthorne , given in ‘ nathaniel hawthorne and his wife , ’ his daily life is set forth . the letter is dated june 1 , 1851 .
melville	typee	‘ since you have been here i have been building some shanties of houses ( connected with the old one ) , and likewise some shanties of chapters and essays . i have been ploughing and sowing and raising and printing and praying , and now begin to come out upon a less bristling time , and to enjoy the calm prospect of things from a fair piazza at the north of the old farmhouse here . not entirely yet , though , am i without something to be urgent with . the ‘ whale ’ is only half through the press ; for , wearied with the long delays of the printers , and disgusted with the heat and dust of the babylonish brick-kiln of new york , i came back to the country to feel the grass , and end the book reclining on it , if i may . ’
melville	typee	mr. hawthorne , who was then living in the red cottage at lenox , had a week at arrow head with his daughter una the previous spring . it is recorded that the friends ‘ spent most of the time in the barn , bathing in the early spring sunshine , which streamed through the open doors , and talking philosophy. ’ according to mr. j. e. a. smith ’ s volume on the berkshire hills , these gentlemen , both reserved in nature , though near neighbours and often in the same company , were inclined to be shy of each other , partly , perhaps , through the knowledge that melville had written a very appreciative review of ‘ mosses from an old manse ’ for the new york literary world , edited by their mutual friends , the duyckincks . ‘ but one day , ’ writes mr. smith , ‘ it chanced that when they were out on a picnic excursion , the two were compelled by a thundershower to take shelter in a narrow recess of the rocks of monument mountain . two hours of this enforced intercourse settled the matter . they learned so much of each other ’ s character , ... that the most intimate friendship for the future was inevitable. ’ a passage in hawthorne ’ s ‘ wonder book ’ is noteworthy as describing the number of literary neighbours in berkshire : --
melville	typee	‘ for my part , i wish i had pegasus here at this moment , ’ said the student . ‘ i would mount him forthwith , and gallop about the country within a circumference of a few miles , making literary calls on my brother authors . dr. dewey would be within ray reach , at the foot of the taconic . in stockbridge , yonder , is mr. james [ g. p. r. james ] , conspicuous to all the world on his mountain-pile of history and romance . longfellow , i believe , is not yet at the oxbow , else the winged horse would neigh at him . but here in lenox i should find our most truthful novelist [ miss sedgwick ] , who has made the scenery and life of berkshire all her own . on the hither side of pittsfield sits herman melville , shaping out the gigantic conception of his ‘ white whale , ’ while the gigantic shadow of greylock looms upon him from his study window . another bound of my flying steed would bring me to the door of holmes , whom i mention last , because pegasus would certainly unseat me the next minute , and claim the poet as his rider . ’
melville	typee	while at pittsfield , mr. melville was induced to enter the lecture field . from 1857 to 1860 he filled many engagements in the lyceums , chiefly speaking of his adventures in the south seas . he lectured in cities as widely apart as montreal , chicago , baltimore , and san francisco , sailing to the last-named place in 1860 , by way of cape horn , on the meteor , commanded , by his younger brother , captain thomas melville , afterward governor of the ‘ sailor ’ s snug harbor ’ at staten island , n.y . besides his voyage to san francisco , he had , in 1849 and 1856 , visited england , the continent , and the holy land , partly to superintend the publication of english editions of his works , and partly for recreation .
melville	typee	a pronounced feature of melville ’ s character was his unwillingness to speak of himself , his adventures , or his writings in conversation . he was , however , able to overcome this reluctance on the lecture platform . our author ’ s tendency to philosophical discussion is strikingly set forth in a letter from dr. titus munson coan to the latter ’ s mother , written while a student at williams college over thirty years ago , and fortunately preserved by her . dr. coan enjoyed the friendship and confidence of mr. melville during most of his residence in new york . the letter reads : --
melville	typee	‘ i have made my first literary pilgrimage , a call upon herman melville , the renowned author of ‘ typee , ’ etc . he lives in a spacious farmhouse about two miles from pittsfield , a weary walk through the dust . but it as well repaid . i introduced myself as a hawaiian-american , and soon found myself in full tide of talk , or rather of monologue . but he would not repeat the experiences of which i had been reading with rapture in his books . in vain i sought to hear of typee and those paradise islands , but he preferred to pour forth his philosophy and his theories of life . the shade of aristotle arose like a cold mist between myself and fayaway . we have quite enough of deep philosophy at williams college , and i confess i was disappointed in this trend of the talk . but what a talk it was ! melville is transformed from a marquesan to a gypsy student , the gypsy element still remaining strong within him . and this contradiction gives him the air of one who has suffered from opposition , both literary and social . with his liberal views , he is apparently considered by the good people of pittsfield as little better than a cannibal or a ‘ beach-comber. ’ his attitude seemed to me something like that of ishmael ; but perhaps i judged hastily . i managed to draw him out very freely on everything but the marquesas islands , and when i left him he was in full tide of discourse on all things sacred and profane . but he seems to put away the objective side of his life , and to shut himself up in this cold north as a cloistered thinker . ’
melville	typee	i have been told by dr. coan that his father , the rev . titus coan , of the hawaiian islands , personally visited the marquesas group , found the typee valley , and verified in all respects the statements made in ‘ typee. ’ it is known that mr. melville from early manhood indulged deeply in philosophical studies , and his fondness for discussing such matters is pointed out by hawthorne also , in the ‘ english note books. ’ this habit increased as he advanced in years , if possible .
melville	typee	the chief event of the residence in pittsfield was the completion and publication of ‘ moby dick ; or , the whale , ’ in 1851 . how many young men have been drawn to sea by this book is a question of interest . meeting with mr. charles henry webb [ ‘ john paul ’ ) the day after mr. melville ’ s death , i asked him if he were not familiar with that author ’ s writings . he replied that ‘ moby dick ’ was responsible for his three years of life before the mast when a lad , and added that while ‘ gamming ’ on board another vessel he had once fallen in with a member of the boat ’ s crew which rescued melville from his friendly imprisonment among the typees .
melville	typee	while at pittsfield , besides his own family , mr. melville ’ s mother and sisters resided with him . as his four children grew up he found it necessary to obtain for them better facilities for study than the village school afforded ; and so , several years after , the household was broken up , and he removed with his wife and children to the new york house that was afterwards his home . this house belonged to his brother allan , and was exchanged for the estate at pittsfield . in december , 1866 , he was appointed by mr. h. a. smyth , a former travelling companion in europe , a district officer in the new york custom house . he held the position until 1886 , preferring it to in-door clerical work , and then resigned , the duties becoming too arduous for his failing strength .
melville	typee	in addition to his philosophical studies , mr. melville was much interested in all matters relating to the fine arts , and devoted most of his leisure hours to the two subjects . a notable collection of etchings and engravings from the old masters was gradually made by him , those from claude ’ s paintings being a specialty . after he retired from the custom house , his tall , stalwart figure could be seen almost daily tramping through the fort george district or central park , his roving inclination leading him to obtain as much out-door life as possible . his evenings were spent at home with his books , his pictures , and his family , and usually with them alone ; for , in spite of the melodramatic declarations of various english gentlemen , melville ’ s seclusion in his latter years , and in fact throughout his life , was a matter of personal choice . more and more , as he grew older , he avoided every action on his part , and on the part of his family , that might tend to keep his name and writings before the public . a few friends felt at liberty to visit the recluse , and were kindly welcomed , but he himself sought no one . his favorite companions were his grandchildren , with whom he delighted to pass his time , and his devoted wife , who was a constant assistant and adviser in his literary work , chiefly done at this period for his own amusement . to her he addressed his last little poem , the touching ‘ return of the sire de nesle. ’ various efforts were made by the new york literary colony to draw him from his retirement , but without success . it has been suggested that he might have accepted a magazine editorship , but this is doubtful , as he could not bear business details or routine work of any sort . his brother allan was a new york lawyer , and until his death , in 1872 , managed melville ’ s affairs with ability , particularly the literary accounts .
melville	typee	during these later years he took great pleasure in a friendly correspondence with mr. w. clark russell . mr. russell had taken many occasions to mention melville ’ s sea-tales , his interest in them , and his indebtedness to them . the latter felt impelled to write mr. russell in regard to one of his newly published novels , and received in answer the following letter :
melville	typee	july 21 , 1886 . my dear mr. melville , your letter has given me a very great and singular pleasure . your delightful books carry the imagination into a maritime period so remote that , often as you have been in my mind , i could never satisfy myself that you were still amongst the living . i am glad , indeed , to learn from mr. toft that you are still hale and hearty , and i do most heartily wish you many years yet of health and vigour .
melville	typee	your books i have in the american edition . i have ‘ typee , ‘ omoo , ’ ‘ redburn , ’ and that noble piece ‘ moby dick. ’ these are all i have been able to obtain . there have been many editions of your works in this country , particularly the lovely south sea sketches ; but the editions are not equal to those of the american publishers . your reputation here is very great . it is hard to meet a man whose opinion as a reader is worth leaving who does not speak of your works in such terms as he might hesitate to employ , with all his patriotism , toward many renowned english writers .
melville	typee	dana is , indeed , great . there is nothing in literature more remarkable than the impression produced by dana ’ s portraiture of the homely inner life of a little brig ’ s forecastle . i beg that you will accept my thanks for the kindly spirit in which you have read my books . i wish it were in my power to cross the atlantic , for you assuredly would be the first whom it would be my happiness to visit .
melville	typee	the condition of my right hand obliges me to dictate this to my son ; but painful as it is to me to hold a pen , i can not suffer this letter to reach the hands of a man of so admirable genitis as herman melville without begging him to believe me to be , with my own hand , his most respectful and hearty admirer , w. clark russell .
melville	typee	it should be noted here that melville ’ s increased reputation in england at the period of this letter was chiefly owing to a series of articles on his work written by mr. russell . i am sorry to say that few english papers made more than a passing reference to melville ’ s death . the american press discussed his life and work in numerous and lengthy reviews . at the same time , there always has been a steady sale of his books in england , and some of them never have been out of print in that country since the publication of ‘ typee. ’ one result of this friendship between the two authors was the dedication of new volumes to each other in highly complimentary terms -- mr. melville ’ s ‘ john marr and other sailors , ’ of which twenty-five copies only were printed , on the one hand , and mr. russell ’ s ‘ an ocean tragedy , ’ on the other , of which many thousand have been printed , not to mention unnumbered pirated copies .
melville	typee	beside hawthorne , mr. richard henry stoddard , of american writers , specially knew and appreciated herman melville . mr. stoddard was connected with the new york dock department at the time of mr. melville ’ s appointment to a custom-house position , and they at once became acquainted . for a good many years , during the period in which our author remained in seclusion , much that appeared in print in america concerning melville came from the pen of mr. stoddard . nevertheless , the sailor author ’ s presence in new york was well known to the literary guild . he was invited to join in all new movements , but as often felt obliged to excuse himself from doing so . the present writer lived for some time within a short distance of his house , but found no opportunity to meet him until it became necessary to obtain his portrait for an anthology in course of publication . the interview was brief , and the interviewer could not help feeling although treated with pleasant courtesy , that more important matters were in hand than the perpetuation of a romancer ’ s countenance to future generations ; but a friendly family acquaintance grew up from the incident , and will remain an abiding memory .
melville	typee	mr. melville died at his home in new york city early on the morning of september 28 , 1891 . his serious illness had lasted a number of months , so that the end came as a release . true to his ruling passion , philosophy had claimed him to the last , a set of schopenhauer ’ s works receiving his attention when able to study ; but this was varied with readings in the ‘ mermaid series ’ of old plays , in which he took much pleasure . his library , in addition to numerous works on philosophy and the fine arts , was composed of standard books of all classes , including , of course , a proportion of nautical literature . especially interesting are fifteen or twenty first editions of hawthorne ’ s books inscribed to mr. and mrs. melville by the author and his wife .
melville	typee	the immediate acceptance of ‘ typee ’ by john murray was followed by an arrangement with the london agent of an american publisher , for its simultaneous publication in the united states . i understand that murray did not then publish fiction . at any rate , the book was accepted by him on the assurance of gansevoort melville that it contained nothing not actually experienced by his brother . murray brought it out early in 1846 , in his colonial and home library , as ‘ a narrative of a four months ’ residence among the natives of a valley of the marquesas islands ; or , a peep at polynesian life , ’ or , more briefly , ‘ melville ’ s marquesas islands. ’ it was issued in america with the author ’ s own title , ‘ typee , ’ and in the outward shape of a work of fiction . mr. melville found himself famous at once . many discussions were carried on as to the genuineness of the author ’ s name and the reality of the events portrayed , but english and american critics alike recognised the book ’ s importance as a contribution to literature .
melville	typee	melville , in a letter to hawthorne , speaks of himself as having no development at all until his twenty-fifth year , the time of his return from the pacific ; but surely the process of development must have been well advanced to permit of so virile and artistic a creation as ‘ typee. ’ while the narrative does not always run smoothly , yet the style for the most part is graceful and alluring , so that we pass from one scene of pacific enchantment to another quite oblivious of the vast amount of descriptive detail which is being poured out upon us . it is the varying fortune of the hero which engrosses our attention . we follow his adventures with breathless interest , or luxuriate with him in the leafy bowers of the ‘ happy valley , ’ surrounded by joyous children of nature . when all is ended , we then for the first time realise that we know these people and their ways as if we too had dwelt among them .
melville	typee	i do not believe that ‘ typee ’ will ever lose its position as a classic of american literature . the pioneer in south sea romance -- for the mechanical descriptions of earlier voyagers are not worthy of comparison -- this book has as yet met with no superior , even in french literature ; nor has it met with a rival in any other language than the french . the character of ‘ fayaway , ’ and , no less , william s. mayo ’ s ‘ kaloolah , ’ the enchanting dreams of many a youthful heart , will retain their charm ; and this in spite of endless variations by modern explorers in the same domain . a faint type of both characters may be found in the surinam yarico of captain john gabriel stedman , whose ‘ narrative of a five years ’ expedition ’ appeared in 1796 .
melville	typee	‘ typee , ’ as written , contained passages reflecting with considerable severity on the methods pursued by missionaries in the south seas . the manuscript was printed in a complete form in england , and created much discussion on this account , melville being accused of bitterness ; but he asserted his lack of prejudice . the passages referred to were omitted in the first and all subsequent american editions . they have been restored in the present issue , which is complete save for a few paragraphs excluded by written direction of the author . i have , with the consent of his family , changed the long and cumbersome sub-title of the book , calling it a ‘ real-romance of the south seas , ’ as best expressing its nature .
melville	typee	the success of his first volume encouraged melville to proceed in his work , and ‘ omoo , ’ the sequel to ‘ typee , ’ appeared in england and america in 1847 . here we leave , for the most part , the dreamy pictures of island life , and find ourselves sharing the extremely realistic discomforts of a sydney whaler in the early forties . the rebellious crew ’ s experiences in the society islands are quite as realistic as events on board ship and very entertaining , while the whimsical character , dr. long ghost , next to captain ahab in ‘ moby dick , ’ is melville ’ s most striking delineation . the errors of the south sea missions are pointed out with even more force than in ‘ typee , ’ and it is a fact that both these books have ever since been of the greatest value to outgoing missionaries on account of the exact information contained in them with respect to the islanders .
melville	typee	melville ’ s power in describing and investing with romance scenes and incidents witnessed and participated in by himself , and his frequent failure of success as an inventor of characters and situations , were early pointed out by his critics . more recently mr. henry s. salt has drawn the same distinction very carefully in an excellent article contributed to the scottish art review . in a prefatory note to ‘ mardi ’ ( 1849 ) , melville declares that , as his former books have been received as romance instead of reality , he will now try his hand at pure fiction . ‘ mardi ’ may be called a splendid failure . it must have been soon after the completion of ‘ omoo ’ that melville began to study the writings of sir thomas browne . heretofore our author ’ s style was rough in places , but marvellously simple and direct . ‘ mardi ’ is burdened with an over-rich diction , which melville never entirely outgrew . the scene of this romance , which opens well , is laid in the south seas , but everything soon becomes overdrawn and fantastical , and the thread of the story loses itself in a mystical allegory .
melville	typee	‘ redburn , ’ already mentioned , succeeded ‘ mardi ’ in the same year , and was a partial return to the author ’ s earlier style . in ‘ white-jacket ; or , the world in a man-of-war ’ ( 1850 ) , melville almost regained it . this book has no equal as a picture of life aboard a sailing man-of-war , the lights and shadows of naval existence being well contrasted .
melville	typee	with ‘ moby dick ; or , the whale ’ ( 1851 ) , melville reached the topmost notch of his fame . the book represents , to a certain extent , the conflict between the author ’ s earlier and later methods of composition , but the gigantic conception of the ‘ white whale , ’ as hawthorne expressed it , permeates the whole work , and lifts it bodily into the highest domain of romance . ‘ moby dick ’ contains an immense amount of information concerning the habits of the whale and the methods of its capture , but this is characteristically introduced in a way not to interfere with the narrative . the chapter entitled ‘ stubb kills a whale ’ ranks with the choicest examples of descriptive literature .
melville	typee	‘ moby dick ’ appeared , and melville enjoyed to the full the enhanced reputation it brought him . he did not , however , take warning from ‘ mardi , ’ but allowed himself to plunge more deeply into the sea of philosophy and fantasy .
melville	typee	‘ pierre ; or , the ambiguities ’ ( 1852 ) was published , and there ensued a long series of hostile criticisms , ending with a severe , though impartial , article by fitz-james o ’ brien in putnam ’ s monthly . about the same time the whole stock of the author ’ s books was destroyed by fire , keeping them out of print at a critical moment ; and public interest , which until then had been on the increase , gradually began to diminish .
melville	typee	after this mr. melville contributed several short stories to putnam ’ s monthly and harper ’ s magazine . those in the former periodical were collected in a volume as piazza tales ( 1856 ) ; and of these ‘ benito cereno ’ and ‘ the bell tower ’ are equal to his best previous efforts .
melville	typee	‘ israel potter : his fifty years of exile ’ ( 1855 ) , first printed as a serial in putnam ’ s , is an historical romance of the american revolution , based on the hero ’ s own account of his adventures , as given in a little volume picked up by mr. melville at a book-stall . the story is well told , but the book is hardly worthy of the author of ‘ typee. ’ ‘ the confidence man ’ ( 1857 ) , his last serious effort in prose fiction , does not seem to require criticism .
melville	typee	mr. melville ’ s pen had rested for nearly ten years , when it was again taken up to celebrate the events of the civil war . ‘ battle pieces and aspects of the war ’ appeared in 1866 . most of these poems originated , according to the author , in an impulse imparted by the fall of richmond ; but they have as subjects all the chief incidents of the struggle . the best of them are ‘ the stone fleet , ’ ‘ in the prison pen , ’ ‘ the college colonel , ’ ‘ the march to the sea , ’ ‘ running the batteries , ’ and ‘ sheridan at cedar creek. ’ some of these had a wide circulation in the press , and were preserved in various anthologies . ‘ clarel , a poem and pilgrimage in the holy land ’ ( 1876 ) , is a long mystical poem requiring , as some one has said , a dictionary , a cyclopaedia , and a copy of the bible for its elucidation . in the two privately printed volumes , the arrangement of which occupied mr. melville during his last illness , there are several fine lyrics . the titles of these books are , ‘ john marr and other sailors ’ ( 1888 ) , and ‘ timoleon ’ ( 1891 ) .
melville	typee	there is no question that mr. melville ’ s absorption in philosophical studies was quite as responsible as the failure of his later books for his cessation from literary productiveness . that he sometimes realised the situation will be seen by a passage in ‘ moby dick ’ : --
melville	typee	‘ didn ’ t i tell you so ? ’ said flask . ‘ yes , you ’ ll soon see this right whale ’ s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti ’ s. ’ ‘ in good time flask ’ s saying proved true . as before , the pequod steeply leaned over towards the sperm whale ’ s head , now , by the counterpoise of both heads , she regained her own keel , though sorely strained , you may well believe . so , when on one side you hoist in locke ’ s head , you go over that way ; but now , on the other side , hoist in kant ’ s and you come back again ; but in very poor plight . thus , some minds forever keep trimming boat . oh , ye foolish ! throw all these thunderheads overboard , and then you will float right and light . ’
melville	typee	mr. melville would have been more than mortal if he had been indifferent to his loss of popularity . yet he seemed contented to preserve an entirely independent attitude , and to trust to the verdict of the future . the smallest amount of activity would have kept him before the public ; but his reserve would not permit this . that reinstatement of his reputation can not be doubted .
melville	typee	in the editing of this reissue of ‘ melville ’ s works , ’ i have been much indebted to the scholarly aid of dr. titus munson coan , whose familiarity with the languages of the pacific has enabled me to harmonise the spelling of foreign words in ‘ typee ’ and ‘ omoo , ’ though without changing the phonetic method of printing adopted by mr. melville . dr. coan has also been most helpful with suggestions in other directions . finally , the delicate fancy of la fargehas supplemented the immortal pen-portrait of the typee maiden with a speaking impersonation of her beauty .

melville	typee	six months at sea ! yes , reader , as i live , six months out of sight of land ; cruising after the sperm-whale beneath the scorching sun of the line , and tossed on the billows of the wide-rolling pacific -- the sky above , the sea around , and nothing else ! weeks and weeks ago our fresh provisions were all exhausted . there is not a sweet potato left ; not a single yam . those glorious bunches of bananas , which once decorated our stern and quarter-deck , have , alas , disappeared ! and the delicious oranges which hung suspended from our tops and stays -- they , too , are gone ! yes , they are all departed , and there is nothing left us but salt-horse and sea-biscuit . oh ! ye state-room sailors , who make so much ado about a fourteen-days ’ passage across the atlantic ; who so pathetically relate the privations and hardships of the sea , where , after a day of breakfasting , lunching , dining off five courses , chatting , playing whist , and drinking champagne-punch , it was your hard lot to be shut up in little cabinets of mahogany and maple , and sleep for ten hours , with nothing to disturb you but ‘ those good-for-nothing tars , shouting and tramping overhead ’ , -- what would ye say to our six months out of sight of land ?
melville	typee	oh ! for a refreshing glimpse of one blade of grass -- for a snuff at the fragrance of a handful of the loamy earth ! is there nothing fresh around us ? is there no green thing to be seen ? yes , the inside of our bulwarks is painted green ; but what a vile and sickly hue it is , as if nothing bearing even the semblance of verdure could flourish this weary way from land . even the bark that once clung to the wood we use for fuel has been gnawed off and devoured by the captain ’ s pig ; and so long ago , too , that the pig himself has in turn been devoured .
melville	typee	there is but one solitary tenant in the chicken-coop , once a gay and dapper young cock , bearing him so bravely among the coy hens . but look at him now ; there he stands , moping all the day long on that everlasting one leg of his . he turns with disgust from the mouldy corn before him , and the brackish water in his little trough . he mourns no doubt his lost companions , literally snatched from him one by one , and never seen again . but his days of mourning will be few for mungo , our black cook , told me yesterday that the word had at last gone forth , and poor pedro ’ s fate was sealed . his attenuated body will be laid out upon the captain ’ s table next sunday , and long before night will be buried with all the usual ceremonies beneath that worthy individual ’ s vest . who would believe that there could be any one so cruel as to long for the decapitation of the luckless pedro ; yet the sailors pray every minute , selfish fellows , that the miserable fowl may be brought to his end . they say the captain will never point the ship for the land so long as he has in anticipation a mess of fresh meat . this unhappy bird can alone furnish it ; and when he is once devoured , the captain will come to his senses . i wish thee no harm , pedro ; but as thou art doomed , sooner or later , to meet the fate of all thy race ; and if putting a period to thy existence is to be the signal for our deliverance , why -- truth to speak -- i wish thy throat cut this very moment ; for , oh ! how i wish to see the living earth again ! the old ship herself longs to look out upon the land from her hawse-holes once more , and jack lewis said right the other day when the captain found fault with his steering .
melville	typee	‘ why d ’ ye see , captain vangs , ’ says bold jack , ‘ i ’ m as good a helmsman as ever put hand to spoke ; but none of us can steer the old lady now . we can ’ t keep her full and bye , sir ; watch her ever so close , she will fall off and then , sir , when i put the helm down so gently , and try like to coax her to the work , she won ’ t take it kindly , but will fall round off again ; and it ’ s all because she knows the land is under the lee , sir , and she won ’ t go any more to windward. ’ aye , and why should she , jack ? didn ’ t every one of her stout timbers grow on shore , and hasn ’ t she sensibilities ; as well as we ?
melville	typee	poor old ship ! her very looks denote her desires ! how deplorably she appears ! the paint on her sides , burnt up by the scorching sun , is puffed out and cracked . see the weeds she trails along with her , and what an unsightly bunch of those horrid barnacles has formed about her stern-piece ; and every time she rises on a sea , she shows her copper torn away , or hanging in jagged strips .
melville	typee	poor old ship ! i say again : for six months she has been rolling and pitching about , never for one moment at rest . but courage , old lass , i hope to see thee soon within a biscuit ’ s toss of the merry land , riding snugly at anchor in some green cove , and sheltered from the boisterous winds .
melville	typee	. . . . . . ‘ hurra , my lads ! it ’ s a settled thing ; next week we shape our course to the marquesas ! ’ the marquesas ! what strange visions of outlandish things does the very name spirit up ! naked houris -- cannibal banquets -- groves of cocoanut -- coral reefs -- tattooed chiefs -- and bamboo temples ; sunny valleys planted with bread-fruit-trees -- carved canoes dancing on the flashing blue waters -- savage woodlands guarded by horrible idols -- heathenish rites and human sacrifices .
melville	typee	such were the strangely jumbled anticipations that haunted me during our passage from the cruising ground . i felt an irresistible curiosity to see those islands which the olden voyagers had so glowingly described .
melville	typee	the group for which we were now steering ( although among the earliest of european discoveries in the south seas , having been first visited in the year 1595 ) still continues to be tenanted by beings as strange and barbarous as ever . the missionaries sent on a heavenly errand , had sailed by their lovely shores , and had abandoned them to their idols of wood and stone . how interesting the circumstances under which they were discovered ! in the watery path of mendanna , cruising in quest of some region of gold , these isles had sprung up like a scene of enchantment , and for a moment the spaniard believed his bright dream was realized .
melville	typee	in honour of the marquess de mendoza , then viceroy of peru -- under whose auspices the navigator sailed -- he bestowed upon them the name which denoted the rank of his patron , and gave to the world on his return a vague and magnificent account of their beauty . but these islands , undisturbed for years , relapsed into their previous obscurity ; and it is only recently that anything has been known concerning them . once in the course of a half century , to be sure , some adventurous rover would break in upon their peaceful repose , and astonished at the unusual scene , would be almost tempted to claim the merit of a new discovery .
melville	typee	of this interesting group , but little account has ever been given , if we except the slight mention made of them in the sketches of south-sea voyages . cook , in his repeated circumnavigations of the globe , barely touched at their shores ; and all that we know about them is from a few general narratives .
melville	typee	among these , there are two that claim particular notice . porter ’ s ‘ journal of the cruise of the u.s. frigate essex , in the pacific , during the late war ’ , is said to contain some interesting particulars concerning the islanders . this is a work , however , which i have never happened to meet with ; and stewart , the chaplain of the american sloop of war vincennes , has likewise devoted a portion of his book , entitled ‘ a visit to the south seas ’ , to the same subject .
melville	typee	within the last few , years american and english vessels engaged in the extensive whale fisheries of the pacific have occasionally , when short of provisions , put into the commodious harbour which there is in one of the islands ; but a fear of the natives , founded on the recollection of the dreadful fate which many white men have received at their hands , has deterred their crews from intermixing with the population sufficiently to gain any insight into their peculiar customs and manners .
melville	typee	the protestant missions appear to have despaired of reclaiming these islands from heathenism . the usage they have in every case received from the natives has been such as to intimidate the boldest of their number . ellis , in his ‘ polynesian researches ’ , gives some interesting accounts of the abortive attempts made by the ‘ ’ tahiti mission ’ ’ to establish a branch mission upon certain islands of the group . a short time before my visit to the marquesas , a somewhat amusing incident took place in connection with these efforts , which i can not avoid relating .
melville	typee	an intrepid missionary , undaunted by the ill-success that had attended all previous endeavours to conciliate the savages , and believing much in the efficacy of female influence , introduced among them his young and beautiful wife , the first white woman who had ever visited their shores . the islanders at first gazed in mute admiration at so unusual a prodigy , and seemed inclined to regard it as some new divinity . but after a short time , becoming familiar with its charming aspect , and jealous of the folds which encircled its form , they sought to pierce the sacred veil of calico in which it was enshrined , and in the gratification of their curiosity so far overstepped the limits of good breeding , as deeply to offend the lady ’ s sense of decorum . her sex once ascertained , their idolatry was changed into contempt and there was no end to the contumely showered upon her by the savages , who were exasperated at the deception which they conceived had been practised upon them . to the horror of her affectionate spouse , she was stripped of her garments , and given to understand that she could no longer carry on her deceits with impunity . the gentle dame was not sufficiently evangelical to endure this , and , fearful of further improprieties , she forced her husband to relinquish his undertaking , and together they returned to tahiti .
melville	typee	not thus shy of exhibiting her charms was the island queen herself , the beauteous wife of movianna , the king of nukuheva . between two and three years after the adventures recorded in this volume , i chanced , while aboard of a man-of-war to touch at these islands . the french had then held possession of the marquesas some time , and already prided themselves upon the beneficial effects of their jurisdiction , as discernible in the deportment of the natives . to be sure , in one of their efforts at reform they had slaughtered about a hundred and fifty of them at whitihoo -- but let that pass . at the time i mention , the french squadron was rendezvousing in the bay of nukuheva , and during an interview between one of their captains and our worthy commodore , it was suggested by the former , that we , as the flag-ship of the american squadron , should receive , in state , a visit from the royal pair . the french officer likewise represented , with evident satisfaction , that under their tuition the king and queen had imbibed proper notions of their elevated station , and on all ceremonious occasions conducted themselves with suitable dignity . accordingly , preparations were made to give their majesties a reception on board in a style corresponding with their rank .
melville	typee	one bright afternoon , a gig , gaily bedizened with streamers , was observed to shove off from the side of one of the french frigates , and pull directly for our gangway . in the stern sheets reclined mowanna and his consort . as they approached , we paid them all the honours due to royalty ; -- manning our yards , firing a salute , and making a prodigious hubbub .
melville	typee	they ascended the accommodation ladder , were greeted by the commodore , hat in hand , and passing along the quarter-deck , the marine guard presented arms , while the band struck up ‘ the king of the cannibal islands ’ . so far all went well . the french officers grimaced and smiled in exceedingly high spirits , wonderfully pleased with the discreet manner in which these distinguished personages behaved themselves .
melville	typee	their appearance was certainly calculated to produce an effect . his majesty was arrayed in a magnificent military uniform , stiff with gold lace and embroidery , while his shaven crown was concealed by a huge chapeau bras , waving with ostrich plumes . there was one slight blemish , however , in his appearance . a broad patch of tattooing stretched completely across his face , in a line with his eyes , making him look as if he wore a huge pair of goggles ; and royalty in goggles suggested some ludicrous ideas . but it was in the adornment of the fair person of his dark-complexioned spouse that the tailors of the fleet had evinced the gaiety of their national taste . she was habited in a gaudy tissue of scarlet cloth , trimmed with yellow silk , which , descending a little below the knees , exposed to view her bare legs , embellished with spiral tattooing , and somewhat resembling two miniature trajan ’ s columns . upon her head was a fanciful turban of purple velvet , figured with silver sprigs , and surmounted by a tuft of variegated feathers .
melville	typee	the ship ’ s company , crowding into the gangway to view the sight , soon arrested her majesty ’ s attention . she singled out from their number an old salt , whose bare arms and feet , and exposed breast , were covered with as many inscriptions in india ink as the lid of an egyptian sarcophagus . notwithstanding all the sly hints and remonstrances of the french officers , she immediately approached the man , and pulling further open the bosom of his duck frock , and rolling up the leg of his wide trousers , she gazed with admiration at the bright blue and vermilion pricking thus disclosed to view . she hung over the fellow , caressing him , and expressing her delight in a variety of wild exclamations and gestures . the embarrassment of the polite gauls at such an unlooked-for occurrence may be easily imagined , but picture their consternation , when all at once the royal lady , eager to display the hieroglyphics on her own sweet form , bent forward for a moment , and turning sharply round , threw up the skirt of her mantle and revealed a sight from which the aghast frenchmen retreated precipitately , and tumbling into their boats , fled the scene of so shocking a catastrophe .

melville	typee	i can never forget the eighteen or twenty days during which the light trade-winds were silently sweeping us towards the islands . in pursuit of the sperm whale , we had been cruising on the line some twenty degrees to the westward of the gallipagos ; and all that we had to do , when our course was determined on , was to square in the yards and keep the vessel before the breeze , and then the good ship and the steady gale did the rest between them . the man at the wheel never vexed the old lady with any superfluous steering , but comfortably adjusting his limbs at the tiller , would doze away by the hour . true to her work , the dolly headed to her course , and like one of those characters who always do best when let alone , she jogged on her way like a veteran old sea-pacer as she was .
melville	typee	what a delightful , lazy , languid time we had whilst we were thus gliding along ! there was nothing to be done ; a circumstance that happily suited our disinclination to do anything . we abandoned the fore-peak altogether , and spreading an awning over the forecastle , slept , ate , and lounged under it the live-long day . every one seemed to be under the influence of some narcotic . even the officers aft , whose duty required them never to be seated while keeping a deck watch , vainly endeavoured to keep on their pins ; and were obliged invariably to compromise the matter by leaning up against the bulwarks , and gazing abstractedly over the side . reading was out of the question ; take a book in your hand , and you were asleep in an instant .
melville	typee	although i could not avoid yielding in a great measure to the general languor , still at times i contrived to shake off the spell , and to appreciate the beauty of the scene around me . the sky presented a clear expanse of the most delicate blue , except along the skirts of the horizon , where you might see a thin drapery of pale clouds which never varied their form or colour . the long , measured , dirge-like well of the pacific came rolling along , with its surface broken by little tiny waves , sparkling in the sunshine . every now and then a shoal of flying fish , scared from the water under the bows , would leap into the air , and fall the next moment like a shower of silver into the sea . then you would see the superb albicore , with his glittering sides , sailing aloft , and often describing an arc in his descent , disappear on the surface of the water . far off , the lofty jet of the whale might be seen , and nearer at hand the prowling shark , that villainous footpad of the seas , would come skulking along , and , at a wary distance , regard us with his evil eye . at times , some shapeless monster of the deep , floating on the surface , would , as we approached , sink slowly into the blue waters , and fade away from the sight . but the most impressive feature of the scene was the almost unbroken silence that reigned over sky and water . scarcely a sound could be heard but the occasional breathing of the grampus , and the rippling at the cut-water .
melville	typee	as we drew nearer the land , i hailed with delight the appearance of innumerable sea-fowl . screaming and whirling in spiral tracks , they would accompany the vessel , and at times alight on our yards and stays . that piratical-looking fellow , appropriately named the man-of-war ’ s-hawk , with his blood-red bill and raven plumage , would come sweeping round us in gradually diminishing circles , till you could distinctly mark the strange flashings of his eye ; and then , as if satisfied with his observation , would sail up into the air and disappear from the view . soon , other evidences of our vicinity to the land were apparent , and it was not long before the glad announcement of its being in sight was heard from aloft , -- given with that peculiar prolongation of sound that a sailor loves -- ‘ land ho ! ’
melville	typee	the captain , darting on deck from the cabin , bawled lustily for his spy-glass ; the mate in still louder accents hailed the masthead with a tremendous ‘ where-away ? ’ the black cook thrust his woolly head from the galley , and boatswain , the dog , leaped up between the knight-heads , and barked most furiously . land ho ! aye , there it was . a hardly perceptible blue irregular outline , indicating the bold contour of the lofty heights of nukuheva .
melville	typee	this island , although generally called one of the marquesas , is by some navigators considered as forming one of a distinct cluster , comprising the islands of ruhooka , ropo , and nukuheva ; upon which three the appellation of the washington group has been bestowed . they form a triangle , and lie within the parallels of 8° 38″ and 9° 32″ south latitude and 139° 20′ and 140° 10′ west longitude from greenwich . with how little propriety they are to be regarded as forming a separate group will be at once apparent , when it is considered that they lie in the immediate vicinity of the other islands , that is to say , less than a degree to the northwest of them ; that their inhabitants speak the marquesan dialect , and that their laws , religion , and general customs are identical . the only reason why they were ever thus arbitrarily distinguished may be attributed to the singular fact , that their existence was altogether unknown to the world until the year 1791 , when they were discovered by captain ingraham , of boston , massachusetts , nearly two centuries after the discovery of the adjacent islands by the agent of the spanish viceroy . notwithstanding this , i shall follow the example of most voyagers , and treat of them as forming part and parcel of marquesas .
melville	typee	nukuheva is the most important of these islands , being the only one at which ships are much in the habit of touching , and is celebrated as being the place where the adventurous captain porter refitted his ships during the late war between england and the united states , and whence he sallied out upon the large whaling fleet then sailing under the enemy ’ s flag in the surrounding seas . this island is about twenty miles in length and nearly as many in breadth . it has three good harbours on its coast ; the largest and best of which is called by the people living in its vicinity ‘ taiohae ’ , and by captain porter was denominated massachusetts bay . among the adverse tribes dwelling about the shores of the other bays , and by all voyagers , it is generally known by the name bestowed upon the island itself -- nukuheva . its inhabitants have become somewhat corrupted , owing to their recent commerce with europeans , but so far as regards their peculiar customs and general mode of life , they retain their original primitive character , remaining very nearly in the same state of nature in which they were first beheld by white men . the hostile clans , residing in the more remote sections of the island , and very seldom holding any communication with foreigners , are in every respect unchanged from their earliest known condition .
melville	typee	in the bay of nukuheva was the anchorage we desired to reach . we had perceived the loom of the mountains about sunset ; so that after running all night with a very light breeze , we found ourselves close in with the island the next morning , but as the bay we sought lay on its farther side , we were obliged to sail some distance along the shore , catching , as we proceeded , short glimpses of blooming valleys , deep glens , waterfalls , and waving groves hidden here and there by projecting and rocky headlands , every moment opening to the view some new and startling scene of beauty .
melville	typee	those who for the first time visit the south sea , generally are surprised at the appearance of the islands when beheld from the sea . from the vague accounts we sometimes have of their beauty , many people are apt to picture to themselves enamelled and softly swelling plains , shaded over with delicious groves , and watered by purling brooks , and the entire country but little elevated above the surrounding ocean . the reality is very different ; bold rock-bound coasts , with the surf beating high against the lofty cliffs , and broken here and there into deep inlets , which open to the view thickly-wooded valleys , separated by the spurs of mountains clothed with tufted grass , and sweeping down towards the sea from an elevated and furrowed interior , form the principal features of these islands .
melville	typee	towards noon we drew abreast the entrance go the harbour , and at last we slowly swept by the intervening promontory , and entered the bay of nukuheva . no description can do justice to its beauty ; but that beauty was lost to me then , and i saw nothing but the tri-coloured flag of france trailing over the stern of six vessels , whose black hulls and bristling broadsides proclaimed their warlike character . there they were , floating in that lovely bay , the green eminences of the shore looking down so tranquilly upon them , as if rebuking the sternness of their aspect . to my eye nothing could be more out of keeping than the presence of these vessels ; but we soon learnt what brought them there . the whole group of islands had just been taken possession of by rear-admiral du petit thouars , in the name of the invincible french nation .
melville	typee	this item of information was imparted to us by a most extraordinary individual , a genuine south-sea vagabond , who came alongside of us in a whale-boat as soon as we entered the bay , and , by the aid of some benevolent persons at the gangway , was assisted on board , for our visitor was in that interesting stage of intoxication when a man is amiable and helpless . although he was utterly unable to stand erect or to navigate his body across the deck , he still magnanimously proffered his services to pilot the ship to a good and secure anchorage . our captain , however , rather distrusted his ability in this respect , and refused to recognize his claim to the character he assumed ; but our gentleman was determined to play his part , for , by dint of much scrambling , he succeeded in getting into the weather-quarter boat , where he steadied himself by holding on to a shroud , and then commenced issuing his commands with amazing volubility and very peculiar gestures . of course no one obeyed his orders ; but as it was impossible to quiet him , we swept by the ships of the squadron with this strange fellow performing his antics in full view of all the french officers .
melville	typee	we afterwards learned that our eccentric friend had been a lieutenant in the english navy ; but having disgraced his flag by some criminal conduct in one of the principal ports on the main , he had deserted his ship , and spent many years wandering among the islands of the pacific , until accidentally being at nukuheva when the french took possession of the place , he had been appointed pilot of the harbour by the newly constituted authorities .
melville	typee	as we slowly advanced up the bay , numerous canoes pushed off from the surrounding shores , and we were soon in the midst of quite a flotilla of them , their savage occupants struggling to get aboard of us , and jostling one another in their ineffectual attempts . occasionally the projecting out-riggers of their slight shallops running foul of one another , would become entangled beneath the water , threatening to capsize the canoes , when a scene of confusion would ensue that baffles description . such strange outcries and passionate gesticulations i never certainly heard or saw before . you would have thought the islanders were on the point of flying at each other ’ s throats , whereas they were only amicably engaged in disentangling their boats .
melville	typee	scattered here and there among the canoes might be seen numbers of cocoanuts floating closely together in circular groups , and bobbing up and down with every wave . by some inexplicable means these cocoanuts were all steadily approaching towards the ship . as i leaned curiously over the side , endeavouring to solve their mysterious movements , one mass far in advance of the rest attracted my attention . in its centre was something i could take for nothing else than a cocoanut , but which i certainly considered one of the most extraordinary specimens of the fruit i had ever seen . it kept twirling and dancing about among the rest in the most singular manner , and as it drew nearer i thought it bore a remarkable resemblance to the brown shaven skull of one of the savages . presently it betrayed a pair of eyes , and soon i became aware that what i had supposed to have been one of the fruit was nothing else than the head of an islander , who had adopted this singular method of bringing his produce to market . the cocoanuts were all attached to one another by strips of the husk , partly torn from the shell and rudely fastened together . their proprietor inserting his head into the midst of them , impelled his necklace of cocoanuts through the water by striking out beneath the surface with his feet .
melville	typee	i was somewhat astonished to perceive that among the number of natives that surrounded us , not a single female was to be seen . at that time i was ignorant of the fact that by the operation of the ‘ taboo ’ the use of canoes in all parts of the island is rigorously prohibited to the entire sex , for whom it is death even to be seen entering one when hauled on shore ; consequently , whenever a marquesan lady voyages by water , she puts in requisition the paddles of her own fair body .
melville	typee	we had approached within a mile and a half perhaps of this foot of the bay , when some of the islanders , who by this time had managed to scramble aboard of us at the risk of swamping their canoes , directed our attention to a singular commotion in the water ahead of the vessel . at first i imagined it to be produced by a shoal of fish sporting on the surface , but our savage friends assured us that it was caused by a shoal of ‘ whinhenies ’ ( young girls ) , who in this manner were coming off from the shore to welcome is . as they drew nearer , and i watched the rising and sinking of their forms , and beheld the uplifted right arm bearing above the water the girdle of tappa , and their long dark hair trailing beside them as they swam , i almost fancied they could be nothing else than so many mermaids -- and very like mermaids they behaved too .
melville	typee	we were still some distance from the beach , and under slow headway , when we sailed right into the midst of these swimming nymphs , and they boarded us at every quarter ; many seizing hold of the chain-plates and springing into the chains ; others , at the peril of being run over by the vessel in her course , catching at the bob-stays , and wreathing their slender forms about the ropes , hung suspended in the air . all of them at length succeeded in getting up the ship ’ s side , where they clung dripping with the brine and glowing from the bath , their jet-black tresses streaming over their shoulders , and half enveloping their otherwise naked forms . there they hung , sparkling with savage vivacity , laughing gaily at one another , and chattering away with infinite glee . nor were they idle the while , for each one performed the simple offices of the toilette for the other . their luxuriant locks , wound up and twisted into the smallest possible compass , were freed from the briny element ; the whole person carefully dried , and from a little round shell that passed from hand to hand , anointed with a fragrant oil : their adornments were completed by passing a few loose folds of white tappa , in a modest cincture , around the waist . thus arrayed they no longer hesitated , but flung themselves lightly over the bulwarks , and were quickly frolicking about the decks . many of them went forward , perching upon the headrails or running out upon the bowsprit , while others seated themselves upon the taffrail , or reclined at full length upon the boats . what a sight for us bachelor sailors ! how avoid so dire a temptation ? for who could think of tumbling these artless creatures overboard , when they had swum miles to welcome us ?
melville	typee	their appearance perfectly amazed me ; their extreme youth , the light clear brown of their complexions , their delicate features , and inexpressibly graceful figures , their softly moulded limbs , and free unstudied action , seemed as strange as beautiful .
melville	typee	the dolly was fairly captured ; and never i will say was vessel carried before by such a dashing and irresistible party of boarders ! the ship taken , we could not do otherwise than yield ourselves prisoners , and for the whole period that she remained in the bay , the dolly , as well as her crew , were completely in the hands of the mermaids .
melville	typee	in the evening after we had come to an anchor the deck was illuminated with lanterns , and this picturesque band of sylphs , tricked out with flowers , and dressed in robes of variegated tappa , got up a ball in great style . these females are passionately fond of dancing , and in the wild grace and spirit of the style excel everything i have ever seen . the varied dances of the marquesan girls are beautiful in the extreme , but there is an abandoned voluptuousness in their character which i dare not attempt to describe .
melville	typee	chapter three some account of the late operations of the french at the marquesas -- prudent conduct of the admiral -- sensation produced by the arrival of the strangers -- the first horse seen by the islanders -- reflections -- miserable subterfuge of the french -- digression concerning tahiti -- seizure of the island by the admiral -- spirited conduct of an english lady
melville	typee	it was in the summer of 1842 that we arrived at the islands ; the french had then held possession of them for several weeks . during this time they had visited some of the principal places in the group , and had disembarked at various points about five hundred troops . these were employed in constructing works of defence , and otherwise providing against the attacks of the natives , who at any moment might be expected to break out in open hostility . the islanders looked upon the people who made this cavalier appropriation of their shores with mingled feelings of fear and detestation . they cordially hated them ; but the impulses of their resentment were neutralized by their dread of the floating batteries , which lay with their fatal tubes ostentatiously pointed , not at fortifications and redoubts , but at a handful of bamboo sheds , sheltered in a grove of cocoanuts ! a valiant warrior doubtless , but a prudent one too , was this same rear-admiral du petit thouars . four heavy , doublebanked frigates and three corvettes to frighten a parcel of naked heathen into subjection ! sixty-eight pounders to demolish huts of cocoanut boughs , and congreve rockets to set on fire a few canoe sheds !
melville	typee	at nukuheva , there were about one hundred soldiers ashore . they were encamped in tents , constructed of the old sails and spare spars of the squadron , within the limits of a redoubt mounted with a few nine-pounders , and surrounded with a fosse . every other day , these troops were marched out in martial array , to a level piece of ground in the vicinity , and there for hours went through all sorts of military evolutions , surrounded by flocks of the natives , who looked on with savage admiration at the show , and as savage a hatred of the actors . a regiment of the old guard , reviewed on a summer ’ s day in the champs elysees , could not have made a more critically correct appearance . the officers ’ regimentals , resplendent with gold lace and embroidery as if purposely calculated to dazzle the islanders , looked as if just unpacked from their parisian cases .
melville	typee	the sensation produced by the presence of the strangers had not in the least subsided at the period of our arrival at the islands . the natives still flocked in numbers about the encampment , and watched with the liveliest curiosity everything that was going forward . a blacksmith ’ s forge , which had been set up in the shelter of a grove near the beach , attracted so great a crowd , that it required the utmost efforts of the sentries posted around to keep the inquisitive multitude at a sufficient distance to allow the workmen to ply their vocation . but nothing gained so large a share of admiration as a horse , which had been brought from valparaiso by the achille , one of the vessels of the squadron . the animal , a remarkably fine one , had been taken ashore , and stabled in a hut of cocoanut boughs within the fortified enclosure . occasionally it was brought out , and , being gaily caparisoned , was ridden by one of the officers at full speed over the hard sand beach . this performance was sure to be hailed with loud plaudits , and the ‘ puarkee nuee ’ ( big hog ) was unanimously pronounced by the islanders to be the most extraordinary specimen of zoology that had ever come under their observation .
melville	typee	the expedition for the occupation of the marquesas had sailed from brest in the spring of 1842 , and the secret of its destination was solely in the possession of its commander . no wonder that those who contemplated such a signal infraction of the rights of humanity should have sought to veil the enormity from the eyes of the world . and yet , notwithstanding their iniquitous conduct in this and in other matters , the french have ever plumed themselves upon being the most humane and polished of nations . a high degree of refinement , however , does not seem to subdue our wicked propensities so much after all ; and were civilization itself to be estimated by some of its results , it would seem perhaps better for what we call the barbarous part of the world to remain unchanged .
melville	typee	one example of the shameless subterfuges under which the french stand prepared to defend whatever cruelties they may hereafter think fit to commit in bringing the marquesan natives into subjection is well worthy of being recorded . on some flimsy pretext or other mowanna , the king of nukuheva , whom the invaders by extravagant presents had cajoled over to their interests , and moved about like a mere puppet , has been set up as the rightful sovereign of the entire island -- the alleged ruler by prescription of various clans , who for ages perhaps have treated with each other as separate nations . to reinstate this much-injured prince in the assumed dignities of his ancestors , the disinterested strangers have come all the way from france : they are determined that his title shall be acknowledged . if any tribe shall refuse to recognize the authority of the french , by bowing down to the laced chapeau of mowanna , let them abide the consequences of their obstinacy . under cover of a similar pretence , have the outrages and massacres at tahiti the beautiful , the queen of the south seas , been perpetrated .
melville	typee	on this buccaneering expedition , rear admiral du petit thouars , leaving the rest of his squadron at the marquesas , -- which had then been occupied by his forces about five months -- set sail for the doomed island in the reine blanche frigate . on his arrival , as an indemnity for alleged insults offered to the flag of his country , he demanded some twenty or thirty thousand dollars to be placed in his hands forthwith , and in default of payment , threatened to land and take possession of the place .
melville	typee	the frigate , immediately upon coming to an anchor , got springs on her cables , and with her guns cast loose and her men at their quarters , lay in the circular basin of papeete , with her broadside bearing upon the devoted town ; while her numerous cutters , hauled in order alongside , were ready to effect a landing , under cover of her batteries . she maintained this belligerent attitude for several days , during which time a series of informal negotiations were pending , and wide alarm spread over the island . many of the tahitians were at first disposed to resort to arms , and drive the invaders from their shores ; but more pacific and feebler counsels ultimately prevailed . the unfortunate queen pomare , incapable of averting the impending calamity , terrified at the arrogance of the insolent frenchman , and driven at last to despair , fled by night in a canoe to emio .
melville	typee	during the continuance of the panic there occurred an instance of feminine heroism that i can not omit to record . in the grounds of the famous missionary consul , pritchard , then absent in london , the consular flag of britain waved as usual during the day , from a lofty staff planted within a few yards of the beach , and in full view of the frigate . one morning an officer , at the head of a party of men , presented himself at the verandah of mr pritchard ’ s house , and inquired in broken english for the lady his wife . the matron soon made her appearance ; and the polite frenchman , making one of his best bows , and playing gracefully with the aiguillettes that danced upon his breast , proceeded in courteous accents to deliver his mission . ‘ the admiral desired the flag to be hauled down -- hoped it would be perfectly agreeable -- and his men stood ready to perform the duty. ’ ‘ tell the pirate your master , ’ replied the spirited englishwoman , pointing to the staff , ‘ that if he wishes to strike these colours , he must come and perform the act himself ; i will suffer no one else to do it. ’ the lady then bowed haughtily and withdrew into the house . as the discomfited officer slowly walked away , he looked up to the flag , and perceived that the cord by which it was elevated to its place , led from the top of the staff , across the lawn , to an open upper window of the mansion , where sat the lady from whom he had just parted , tranquilly engaged in knitting . was that flag hauled down ? mrs pritchard thinks not ; and rear-admiral du petit thouars is believed to be of the same opinion .
melville	typee	chapter four state of affairs aboard the ship -- contents of her larder -- length of south seamen ’ s voyages -- account of a flying whale-man -- determination to leave the vessel -- the bay of nukuheva -- the typees -- invasion of their valley by porter -- reflections -- glen of tior -- interview between the old king and the french admiral
melville	typee	our ship had not been many days in the harbour of nukuheva before i came to the determination of leaving her . that my reasons for resolving to take this step were numerous and weighty , may be inferred from the fact that i chose rather to risk my fortunes among the savages of the island than to endure another voyage on board the dolly . to use the concise , pointblank phrase of the sailors . i had made up my mind to ‘ run away ’ . now as a meaning is generally attached to these two words no way flattering to the individual to whom they are applied , it behoves me , for the sake of my own character , to offer some explanation of my conduct .
melville	typee	when i entered on board the dolly , i signed as a matter of course the ship ’ s articles , thereby voluntarily engaging and legally binding myself to serve in a certain capacity for the period of the voyage ; and , special considerations apart , i was of course bound to fulfill the agreement . but in all contracts , if one party fail to perform his share of the compact , is not the other virtually absolved from his liability ? who is there who will not answer in the affirmative ?
melville	typee	having settled the principle , then , let me apply it to the particular case in question . in numberless instances had not only the implied but the specified conditions of the articles been violated on the part of the ship in which i served . the usage on board of her was tyrannical ; the sick had been inhumanly neglected ; the provisions had been doled out in scanty allowance ; and her cruises were unreasonably protracted . the captain was the author of the abuses ; it was in vain to think that he would either remedy them , or alter his conduct , which was arbitrary and violent in the extreme . his prompt reply to all complaints and remonstrances was -- the butt-end of a handspike , so convincingly administered as effectually to silence the aggrieved party .
melville	typee	to whom could we apply for redress ? we had left both law and equity on the other side of the cape ; and unfortunately , with a very few exceptions , our crew was composed of a parcel of dastardly and meanspirited wretches , divided among themselves , and only united in enduring without resistance the unmitigated tyranny of the captain . it would have been mere madness for any two or three of the number , unassisted by the rest , to attempt making a stand against his ill usage . they would only have called down upon themselves the particular vengeance of this ‘ lord of the plank ’ , and subjected their shipmates to additional hardships .
melville	typee	but , after all , these things could have been endured awhile , had we entertained the hope of being speedily delivered from them by the due completion of the term of our servitude . but what a dismal prospect awaited us in this quarter ! the longevity of cape horn whaling voyages is proverbial , frequently extending over a period of four or five years .
melville	typee	some long-haired , bare-necked youths , who , forced by the united influences of captain marryatt and hard times , embark at nantucket for a pleasure excursion to the pacific , and whose anxious mothers provide them , with bottled milk for the occasion , oftentimes return very respectable middle-aged gentlemen .
melville	typee	the very preparations made for one of these expeditions are enough to frighten one . as the vessel carries out no cargo , her hold is filled with provisions for her own consumption . the owners , who officiate as caterers for the voyage , supply the larder with an abundance of dainties . delicate morsels of beef and pork , cut on scientific principles from every part of the animal , and of all conceivable shapes and sizes , are carefully packed in salt , and stored away in barrels ; affording a never-ending variety in their different degrees of toughness , and in the peculiarities of their saline properties . choice old water too , decanted into stout six-barrel-casks , and two pints of which is allowed every day to each soul on board ; together with ample store of sea-bread , previously reduced to a state of petrifaction , with a view to preserve it either from decay or consumption in the ordinary mode , are likewise provided for the nourishment and gastronomic enjoyment of the crew .
melville	typee	but not to speak of the quality of these articles of sailors ’ fare , the abundance in which they are put onboard a whaling vessel is almost incredible . oftentimes , when we had occasion to break out in the hold , and i beheld the successive tiers of casks and barrels , whose contents were all destined to be consumed in due course by the ship ’ s company , my heart has sunk within me .
melville	typee	although , as a general case , a ship unlucky in falling in with whales continues to cruise after them until she has barely sufficient provisions remaining to take her home , turning round then quietly and making the best of her way to her friends , yet there are instances when even this natural obstacle to the further prosecution of the voyage is overcome by headstrong captains , who , bartering the fruits of their hard-earned toils for a new supply of provisions in some of the ports of chili or peru , begin the voyage afresh with unabated zeal and perseverance . it is in vain that the owners write urgent letters to him to sail for home , and for their sake to bring back the ship , since it appears he can put nothing in her . not he . he has registered a vow : he will fill his vessel with good sperm oil , or failing to do so , never again strike yankee soundings .
melville	typee	i heard of one whaler , which after many years ’ absence was given up for lost . the last that had been heard of her was a shadowy report of her having touched at some of those unstable islands in the far pacific , whose eccentric wanderings are carefully noted in each new edition of the south-sea charts . after a long interval , however , ‘ the perseverance ’ -- for that was her name -- was spoken somewhere in the vicinity of the ends of the earth , cruising along as leisurely as ever , her sails all bepatched and be quilted with rope-yarns , her spars fished with old pipe staves , and her rigging knotted and spliced in every possible direction . her crew was composed of some twenty venerable greenwich-pensioner-looking old salts , who just managed to hobble about deck . the ends of all the running ropes , with the exception of the signal halyards and poop-down-haul , were rove through snatch-blocks , and led to the capstan or windlass , so that not a yard was braced or a sail set without the assistance of machinery .
melville	typee	her hull was encrusted with barnacles , which completely encased her . three pet sharks followed in her wake , and every day came alongside to regale themselves from the contents of the cook ’ s bucket , which were pitched over to them . a vast shoal of bonetas and albicores always kept her company .
melville	typee	such was the account i heard of this vessel and the remembrance of it always haunted me ; what eventually became of her i never learned ; at any rate : he never reached home , and i suppose she is still regularly tacking twice in the twenty-four hours somewhere off desolate island , or the devil ’ s-tail peak .
melville	typee	having said thus much touching the usual length of these voyages , when i inform the reader that ours had as it were just commenced , we being only fifteen months out , and even at that time hailed as a late arrival and boarded for news , he will readily perceive that there was little to encourage one in looking forward to the future , especially as i had always had a presentiment that we should make an unfortunate voyage , and our experience so far had justified the expectation .
melville	typee	i may here state , and on my faith as an honest man , that though more than three years have elapsed since i left this same identical vessel , she still continues ; in the pacific , and but a few days since i saw her reported in the papers as having touched at the sandwich islands previous to going on the coast of japan .
melville	typee	but to return to my narrative . placed in these circumstances then , with no prospect of matters mending if i remained aboard the dolly , i at once made up my mind to leave her : to be sure it was rather an inglorious thing to steal away privily from those at whose hands i had received wrongs and outrages that i could not resent ; but how was such a course to be avoided when it was the only alternative left me ? having made up my mind , i proceeded to acquire all the information i could obtain relating to the island and its inhabitants , with a view of shaping my plans of escape accordingly . the result of these inquiries i will now state , in order that the ensuing narrative may be the better understood .
melville	typee	the bay of nukuheva in which we were then lying is an expanse of water not unlike in figure the space included within the limits of a horse-shoe . it is , perhaps , nine miles in circumference . you approach it from the sea by a narrow entrance , flanked on each side by two small twin islets which soar conically to the height of some five hundred feet . from these the shore recedes on both hands , and describes a deep semicircle .
melville	typee	from the verge of the water the land rises uniformly on all sides , with green and sloping acclivities , until from gently rolling hill-sides and moderate elevations it insensibly swells into lofty and majestic heights , whose blue outlines , ranged all around , close in the view . the beautiful aspect of the shore is heightened by deep and romantic glens , which come down to it at almost equal distances , all apparently radiating from a common centre , and the upper extremities of which are lost to the eye beneath the shadow of the mountains . down each of these little valleys flows a clear stream , here and there assuming the form of a slender cascade , then stealing invisibly along until it bursts upon the sight again in larger and more noisy waterfalls , and at last demurely wanders along to the sea .
melville	typee	the houses of the natives , constructed of the yellow bamboo , tastefully twisted together in a kind of wicker-work , and thatched with the long tapering leaves of the palmetto , are scattered irregularly along these valleys beneath the shady branches of the cocoanut trees .
melville	typee	nothing can exceed the imposing scenery of this bay . viewed from our ship as she lay at anchor in the middle of the harbour , it presented the appearance of a vast natural amphitheatre in decay , and overgrown with vines , the deep glens that furrowed it ’ s sides appearing like enormous fissures caused by the ravages of time . very often when lost in admiration at its beauty , i have experienced a pang of regret that a scene so enchanting should be hidden from the world in these remote seas , and seldom meet the eyes of devoted lovers of nature .
melville	typee	besides this bay the shores of the island are indented by several other extensive inlets , into which descend broad and verdant valleys . these are inhabited by as many distinct tribes of savages , who , although speaking kindred dialects of a common language , and having the same religion and laws , have from time immemorial waged hereditary warfare against each other . the intervening mountains generally two or three thousand feet above the level of the sea geographically define the territories of each of these hostile tribes , who never cross them , save on some expedition of war or plunder . immediately adjacent to nukuheva , and only separated from it by the mountains seen from the harbour , lies the lovely valley of happar , whose inmates cherish the most friendly relations with the inhabitants of nukuheva . on the other side of happar , and closely adjoining it , is the magnificent valley of the dreaded typees , the unappeasable enemies of both these tribes .
melville	typee	these celebrated warriors appear to inspire the other islanders with unspeakable terrors . their very name is a frightful one ; for the word ‘ typee ’ in the marquesan dialect signifies a lover of human flesh . it is rather singular that the title should have been bestowed upon them exclusively , inasmuch as the natives of all this group are irreclaimable cannibals . the name may , perhaps , have been given to denote the peculiar ferocity of this clan , and to convey a special stigma along with it .
melville	typee	these same typees enjoy a prodigious notoriety all over the islands . the natives of nukuheva would frequently recount in pantomime to our ship ’ s company their terrible feats , and would show the marks of wounds they had received in desperate encounters with them . when ashore they would try to frighten us by pointing , to one of their own number , and calling him a typee , manifesting no little surprise that we did not take to our heels at so terrible an announcement . it was quite amusing , too , to see with what earnestness they disclaimed all cannibal propensities on their own part , while they denounced their enemies -- the typees -- as inveterate gourmandizers of human flesh ; but this is a peculiarity to which i shall hereafter have occasion to allude .
melville	typee	although i was convinced that the inhabitants of our bay were as arrant cannibals as any of the other tribes on the island , still i could not but feel a particular and most unqualified repugnance to the aforesaid typees . even before visiting the marquesas , i had heard from men who had touched at the group on former voyages some revolting stories in connection with these savages ; and fresh in my remembrance was the adventure of the master of the katherine , who only a few months previous , imprudently venturing into this bay in an armed boat for the purpose of barter , was seized by the natives , carried back a little distance into their valley , and was only saved from a cruel death by the intervention of a young girl , who facilitated his escape by night along the beach to nukuheva .
melville	typee	i had heard too of an english vessel that many years ago , after a weary cruise , sought to enter the bay of nukuheva , and arriving within two or three miles of the land , was met by a large canoe filled with natives , who offered to lead the way to the place of their destination . the captain , unacquainted with the localities of the island , joyfully acceded to the proposition -- the canoe paddled on , the ship followed . she was soon conducted to a beautiful inlet , and dropped her anchor in its waters beneath the shadows of the lofty shore . that same night the perfidious typees , who had thus inveigled her into their fatal bay , flocked aboard the doomed vessel by hundreds , and at a given signal murdered every soul on board .
melville	typee	i shall never forget the observation of one of our crew as we were passing slowly by the entrance of the bay in our way to nukuheva . as we stood gazing over the side at the verdant headlands , ned , pointing with his hand in the direction of the treacherous valley , exclaimed , ‘ there -- there ’ s typee . oh , the bloody cannibals , what a meal they ’ d make of us if we were to take it into our heads to land ! but they say they don ’ t like sailor ’ s flesh , it ’ s too salt . i say , maty , how should you like to be shoved ashore there , eh ? ’ i little thought , as i shuddered at the question , that in the space of a few weeks i should actually be a captive in that self-same valley .
melville	typee	the french , although they had gone through the ceremony of hoisting their colours for a few hours at all the principal places of the group , had not as yet visited the bay of typee , anticipating a fierce resistance on the part of the savages there , which for the present at least they wished to avoid . perhaps they were not a little influenced in the adoption of this unusual policy from a recollection of the warlike reception given by the typees to the forces of captain porter , about the year 1814 , when that brave and accomplished officer endeavoured to subjugate the clan merely to gratify the mortal hatred of his allies the nukuhevas and happars .
melville	typee	on that occasion i have been told that a considerable detachment of sailors and marines from the frigate essex , accompanied by at least two thousand warriors of happar and nukuheva , landed in boats and canoes at the head of the bay , and after penetrating a little distance into the valley , met with the stoutest resistance from its inmates . valiantly , although with much loss , the typees disputed every inch of ground , and after some hard fighting obliged their assailants to retreat and abandon their design of conquest .
melville	typee	the invaders , on their march back to the sea , consoled themselves for their repulse by setting fire to every house and temple in their route ; and a long line of smoking ruins defaced the once-smiling bosom of the valley , and proclaimed to its pagan inhabitants the spirit that reigned in the breasts of christian soldiers . who can wonder at the deadly hatred of the typees to all foreigners after such unprovoked atrocities ?
melville	typee	thus it is that they whom we denominate ‘ savages ’ are made to deserve the title . when the inhabitants of some sequestered island first descry the ‘ big canoe ’ of the european rolling through the blue waters towards their shores , they rush down to the beach in crowds , and with open arms stand ready to embrace the strangers . fatal embrace ! they fold to their bosom the vipers whose sting is destined to poison all their joys ; and the instinctive feeling of love within their breast is soon converted into the bitterest hate .
melville	typee	the enormities perpetrated in the south seas upon some of the inoffensive islanders will nigh pass belief . these things are seldom proclaimed at home ; they happen at the very ends of the earth ; they are done in a corner , and there are none to reveal them . but there is , nevertheless , many a petty trader that has navigated the pacific whose course from island to island might be traced by a series of cold-blooded robberies , kidnappings , and murders , the iniquity of which might be considered almost sufficient to sink her guilty timbers to the bottom of the sea .
melville	typee	sometimes vague accounts of such thing ’ s reach our firesides , and we coolly censure them as wrong , impolitic , needlessly severe , and dangerous to the crews of other vessels . how different is our tone when we read the highly-wrought description of the massacre of the crew of the hobomak by the feejees ; how we sympathize for the unhappy victims , and with what horror do we regard the diabolical heathens , who , after all , have but avenged the unprovoked injuries which they have received . we breathe nothing but vengeance , and equip armed vessels to traverse thousands of miles of ocean in order to execute summary punishment upon the offenders . on arriving at their destination , they burn , slaughter , and destroy , according to the tenor of written instructions , and sailing away from the scene of devastation , call upon all christendom to applaud their courage and their justice .
melville	typee	how often is the term ‘ savages ’ incorrectly applied ! none really deserving of it were ever yet discovered by voyagers or by travellers . they have discovered heathens and barbarians whom by horrible cruelties they have exasperated into savages . it may be asserted without fear of contradictions that in all the cases of outrages committed by polynesians , europeans have at some time or other been the aggressors , and that the cruel and bloodthirsty disposition of some of the islanders is mainly to be ascribed to the influence of such examples .
melville	typee	but to return . owing to the mutual hostilities of the different tribes i have mentioned , the mountainous tracts which separate their respective territories remain altogether uninhabited ; the natives invariably dwelling in the depths of the valleys , with a view of securing themselves from the predatory incursions of their enemies , who often lurk along their borders , ready to cut off any imprudent straggler , or make a descent upon the inmates of some sequestered habitation . i several times met with very aged men , who from this cause had never passed the confines of their native vale , some of them having never even ascended midway up the mountains in the whole course of their lives , and who , accordingly had little idea of the appearance of any other part of the island , the whole of which is not perhaps more than sixty miles in circuit . the little space in which some of these clans pass away their days would seem almost incredible .
melville	typee	the glen of the tior will furnish a curious illustration of this . the inhabited part is not more than four miles in length , and varies in breadth from half a mile to less than a quarter . the rocky vine-clad cliffs on one side tower almost perpendicularly from their base to the height of at least fifteen hundred feet ; while across the vale -- in striking contrast to the scenery opposite -- grass-grown elevations rise one above another in blooming terraces . hemmed in by these stupendous barriers , the valley would be altogether shut out from the rest of the world , were it not that it is accessible from the sea at one end , and by a narrow defile at the other .
melville	typee	the impression produced upon the mind , when i first visited this beautiful glen , will never be obliterated . i had come from nukuheva by water in the ship ’ s boat , and when we entered the bay of tior it was high noon . the heat had been intense , as we had been floating upon the long smooth swell of the ocean , for there was but little wind . the sun ’ s rays had expended all their fury upon us ; and to add to our discomfort , we had omitted to supply ourselves with water previous to starting . what with heat and thirst together , i became so impatient to get ashore , that when at last we glided towards it , i stood up in the bow of the boat ready for a spring . as she shot two-thirds of her length high upon the beach , propelled by three or four strong strokes of the oars , i leaped among a parcel of juvenile savages , who stood prepared to give us a kind reception ; and with them at my heels , yelling like so many imps , i rushed forward across the open ground in the vicinity of the sea , and plunged , diver fashion , into the recesses of the first grove that offered .
melville	typee	what a delightful sensation did i experience ! i felt as if floating in some new element , while all sort of gurgling , trickling , liquid sounds fell upon my ear . people may say what they will about the refreshing influences of a coldwater bath , but commend me when in a perspiration to the shade baths of tior , beneath the cocoanut trees , and amidst the cool delightful atmosphere which surrounds them .
melville	typee	how shall i describe the scenery that met my eye , as i looked out from this verdant recess ! the narrow valley , with its steep and close adjoining sides draperied with vines , and arched overhead with a fret-work of interlacing boughs , nearly hidden from view by masses of leafy verdure , seemed from where i stood like an immense arbour disclosing its vista to the eye , whilst as i advanced it insensibly widened into the loveliest vale eye ever beheld .
melville	typee	it so happened that the very day i was in tior the french admiral , attended by all the boats of his squadron , came down in state from nukuheva to take formal possession of the place . he remained in the valley about two hours , during which time he had a ceremonious interview with the king . the patriarch-sovereign of tior was a man very far advanced in years ; but though age had bowed his form and rendered him almost decrepid , his gigantic frame retained its original magnitude and grandeur of appearance .
melville	typee	he advanced slowly and with evident pain , assisting his tottering steps with the heavy warspear he held in his hand , and attended by a group of grey-bearded chiefs , on one of whom he occasionally leaned for support . the admiral came forward with head uncovered and extended hand , while the old king saluted him by a stately flourish of his weapon . the next moment they stood side by side , these two extremes of the social scale , -- the polished , splendid frenchman , and the poor tattooed savage . they were both tall and noble-looking men ; but in other respects how strikingly contrasted ! du petit thouars exhibited upon his person all the paraphernalia of his naval rank . he wore a richly decorated admiral ’ s frock-coat , a laced chapeau bras , and upon his breast were a variety of ribbons and orders ; while the simple islander , with the exception of a slight cincture about his loins , appeared in all the nakedness of nature .
melville	typee	at what an immeasurable distance , thought i , are these two beings removed from each other . in the one is shown the result of long centuries of progressive civilization and refinement , which have gradually converted the mere creature into the semblance of all that is elevated and grand ; while the other , after the lapse of the same period , has not advanced one step in the career of improvement , ‘ yet , after all , ’ quoth i to myself , ‘ insensible as he is to a thousand wants , and removed from harassing cares , may not the savage be the happier man of the two ? ’ such were the thoughts that arose in my mind as i gazed upon the novel spectacle before me . in truth it was an impressive one , and little likely to be effaced . i can recall even now with vivid distinctness every feature of the scene . the umbrageous shades where the interview took place -- the glorious tropical vegetation around -- the picturesque grouping of the mingled throng of soldiery and natives -- and even the golden-hued bunch of bananas that i held in my hand at the time , and of which i occasionally partook while making the aforesaid philosophical reflections .
melville	typee	chapter five thoughts previous to attempting an escape -- toby , a fellow sailor , agrees to share the adventure -- last night aboard the ship having fully resolved to leave the vessel clandestinely , and having acquired all the knowledge concerning the bay that i could obtain under the circumstances in which i was placed , i now deliberately turned over in my mind every plan to escape that suggested itself , being determined to act with all possible prudence in an attempt where failure would be attended with so many disagreeable consequences . the idea of being taken and brought back ignominiously to the ship was so inexpressibly repulsive to me , that i was determined by no hasty and imprudent measures to render such an event probable .
melville	typee	i knew that our worthy captain , who felt , such a paternal solicitude for the welfare of his crew , would not willingly consent that one of his best hands should encounter the perils of a sojourn among the natives of a barbarous island ; and i was certain that in the event of my disappearance , his fatherly anxiety would prompt him to offer , by way of a reward , yard upon yard of gaily printed calico for my apprehension . he might even have appreciated my services at the value of a musket , in which case i felt perfectly certain that the whole population of the bay would be immediately upon my track , incited by the prospect of so magnificent a bounty .
melville	typee	having ascertained the fact before alluded to , that the islanders , -- from motives of precaution , dwelt altogether in the depths of the valleys , and avoided wandering about the more elevated portions of the shore , unless bound on some expedition of war or plunder , i concluded that if i could effect unperceived a passage to the mountain , i might easily remain among them , supporting myself by such fruits as came in my way until the sailing of the ship , an event of which i could not fail to be immediately apprised , as from my lofty position i should command a view of the entire harbour .
melville	typee	the idea pleased me greatly . it seemed to combine a great deal of practicability with no inconsiderable enjoyment in a quiet way ; for how delightful it would be to look down upon the detested old vessel from the height of some thousand feet , and contrast the verdant scenery about me with the recollection of her narrow decks and gloomy forecastle ! why , it was really refreshing even to think of it ; and so i straightway fell to picturing myself seated beneath a cocoanut tree on the brow of the mountain , with a cluster of plantains within easy reach , criticizing her nautical evolutions as she was working her way out of the harbour .
melville	typee	to be sure there was one rather unpleasant drawback to these agreeable anticipations -- the possibility of falling in with a foraging party of these same bloody-minded typees , whose appetites , edged perhaps by the air of so elevated a region , might prompt them to devour one . this , i must confess , was a most disagreeable view of the matter .
melville	typee	just to think of a party of these unnatural gourmands taking it into their heads to make a convivial meal of a poor devil , who would have no means of escape or defence : however , there was no help for it . i was willing to encounter some risks in order to accomplish my object , and counted much upon my ability to elude these prowling cannibals amongst the many coverts which the mountains afforded . besides , the chances were ten to one in my favour that they would none of them quit their own fastnesses .
melville	typee	i had determined not to communicate my design of withdrawing from the vessel to any of my shipmates , and least of all to solicit any one to accompany me in my flight . but it so happened one night , that being upon deck , revolving over in my mind various plans of escape , i perceived one of the ship ’ s company leaning over the bulwarks , apparently plunged in a profound reverie . he was a young fellow about my own age , for whom i had all along entertained a great regard ; and toby , such was the name by which he went among us , for his real name he would never tell us , was every way worthy of it . he was active , ready and obliging , of dauntless courage , and singularly open and fearless in the expression of his feelings . i had on more than one occasion got him out of scrapes into which this had led him ; and i know not whether it was from this cause , or a certain congeniality of sentiment between us , that he had always shown a partiality for my society . we had battled out many a long watch together , beguiling the weary hours with chat , song , and story , mingled with a good many imprecations upon the hard destiny it seemed our common fortune to encounter .
melville	typee	toby , like myself , had evidently moved in a different sphere of life , and his conversation at times betrayed this , although he was anxious to conceal it . he was one of that class of rovers you sometimes meet at sea , who never reveal their origin , never allude to home , and go rambling over the world as if pursued by some mysterious fate they can not possibly elude .
melville	typee	there was much even in the appearance of toby calculated to draw me towards him , for while the greater part of the crew were as coarse in person as in mind , toby was endowed with a remarkably prepossessing exterior . arrayed in his blue frock and duck trousers , he was as smart a looking sailor as ever stepped upon a deck ; he was singularly small and slightly made , with great flexibility of limb . his naturally dark complexion had been deepened by exposure to the tropical sun , and a mass of jetty locks clustered about his temples , and threw a darker shade into his large black eyes . he was a strange wayward being , moody , fitful , and melancholy -- at times almost morose . he had a quick and fiery temper too , which , when thoroughly roused , transported him into a state bordering on delirium .
melville	typee	it is strange the power that a mind of deep passion has over feebler natures . i have seen a brawny , fellow , with no lack of ordinary courage , fairly quail before this slender stripling , when in one of his curious fits . but these paroxysms seldom occurred , and in them my big-hearted shipmate vented the bile which more calm-tempered individuals get rid of by a continual pettishness at trivial annoyances .
melville	typee	no one ever saw toby laugh . i mean in the hearty abandonment of broad-mouthed mirth . he did smile sometimes , it is true ; and there was a good deal of dry , sarcastic humour about him , which told the more from the imperturbable gravity of his tone and manner .
melville	typee	latterly i had observed that toby ’ s melancholy had greatly increased , and i had frequently seen him since our arrival at the island gazing wistfully upon the shore , when the remainder of the crew would be rioting below . i was aware that he entertained a cordial detestation of the ship , and believed that , should a fair chance of escape present itself , he would embrace it willingly .
melville	typee	but the attempt was so perilous in the place where we then lay , that i supposed myself the only individual on board the ship who was sufficiently reckless to think of it . in this , however , i was mistaken .
melville	typee	when i perceived toby leaning , as i have mentioned , against the bulwarks and buried in thought , it struck me at once that the subject of his meditations might be the same as my own . and if it be so , thought i , is he not the very one of all my shipmates whom i would choose : for the partner of my adventure ? and why should i not have some comrade with me to divide its dangers and alleviate its hardships ? perhaps i might be obliged to lie concealed among the mountains for weeks . in such an event what a solace would a companion be ?
melville	typee	these thoughts passed rapidly through my mind , and i wondered why i had not before considered the matter in this light . but it was not too late . a tap upon the shoulder served to rouse toby from his reverie ; i found him ripe for the enterprise , and a very few words sufficed for a mutual understanding between us . in an hour ’ s time we had arranged all the preliminaries , and decided upon our plan of action . we then ratified our engagement with an affectionate wedding of palms , and to elude suspicion repaired each to his hammock , to spend the last night on board the dolly .
melville	typee	the next day the starboard watch , to which we both belonged , was to be sent ashore on liberty ; and , availing ourselves of this opportunity , we determined , as soon after landing as possible , to separate ourselves from the rest of the men without exciting their suspicions , and strike back at once for the mountains . seen from the ship , their summits appeared inaccessible , but here and there sloping spurs extended from them almost into the sea , buttressing the lofty elevations with which they were connected , and forming those radiating valleys i have before described . one of these ridges , which appeared more practicable than the rest , we determined to climb , convinced that it would conduct us to the heights beyond . accordingly , we carefully observed its bearings and locality from the ship , so that when ashore we should run no chance of missing it .
melville	typee	in all this the leading object we had in view was to seclude ourselves from sight until the departure of the vessel ; then to take our chance as to the reception the nukuheva natives might give us ; and after remaining upon the island as long as we found our stay agreeable , to leave it the first favourable opportunity that offered .
melville	typee	chapter six a specimen of nautical oratory -- criticisms of the sailors -- the starboard watch are given a holiday -- the escape to the mountains early the next morning the starboard watch were mustered upon the quarter-deck , and our worthy captain , standing in the cabin gangway , harangued us as follows : --
melville	typee	‘ now , men , as we are just off a six months ’ cruise , and have got through most all our work in port here , i suppose you want to go ashore . well , i mean to give your watch liberty today , so you may get ready as soon all you please , and go ; but understand this , i am going to give you liberty because i suppose you would growl like so many old quarter gunners if i didn ’ t ; at the same time , if you ’ ll take my advice , every mother ’ s son of you will stay aboard and keep out of the way of the bloody cannibals altogether . ten to one , men , if you go ashore , you will get into some infernal row , and that will be the end of you ; for if those tattooed scoundrels get you a little ways back into their valleys , they ’ ll nab you -- that you may be certain of . plenty of white men have gone ashore here and never been seen any more . there was the old dido , she put in here about two years ago , and sent one watch off on liberty ; they never were heard of again for a week -- the natives swore they didn ’ t know where they were -- and only three of them ever got back to the ship again , and one with his face damaged for life , for the cursed heathens tattooed a broad patch clean across his figure-head . but it will be no use talking to you , for go you will , that i see plainly ; so all i have to say is , that you need not blame me if the islanders make a meal of you . you may stand some chance of escaping them though , if you keep close about the french encampment , -- and are back to the ship again before sunset . keep that much in your mind , if you forget all the rest i ’ ve been saying to you . there , go forward : bear a hand and rig yourselves , and stand by for a call . at two bells the boat will be manned to take you off , and the lord have mercy on you ! ’
melville	typee	various were the emotions depicted upon the countenances of the starboard watch whilst listening to this address ; but on its conclusion there was a general move towards the forecastle , and we soon were all busily engaged in getting ready for the holiday so auspiciously announced by the skipper . during these preparations his harangue was commented upon in no very measured terms ; and one of the party , after denouncing him as a lying old son of a seacook who begrudged a fellow a few hours ’ liberty , exclaimed with an oath , ‘ but you don ’ t bounce me out of my liberty , old chap , for all your yarns ; for i would go ashore if every pebble on the beach was a live coal , and every stick a gridiron , and the cannibals stood ready to broil me on landing . ’
melville	typee	the spirit of this sentiment was responded to by all hands , and we resolved that in spite of the captain ’ s croakings we would make a glorious day of it . but toby and i had our own game to play , and we availed ourselves of the confusion which always reigns among a ship ’ s company preparatory to going ashore , to confer together and complete our arrangements . as our object was to effect as rapid a flight as possible to the mountains , we determined not to encumber ourselves with any superfluous apparel ; and accordingly , while the rest were rigging themselves out with some idea of making a display , we were content to put on new stout duck trousers , serviceable pumps , and heavy havre-frocks , which with a payta hat completed our equipment .
melville	typee	when our shipmates wondered at this , toby exclaimed in his odd grave way that the rest might do , as they liked , but that he for one preserved his go-ashore traps for the spanish main , where the tie of a sailor ’ s neckerchief might make some difference ; but as for a parcel of unbreeched heathen , he wouldn ’ t go to the bottom of his chest for any of them , and was half disposed to appear among them in buff himself . the men laughed at what they thought was one of his strange conceits , and so we escaped suspicion .
melville	typee	it may appear singular that we should have been thus on our guard with our own shipmates ; but there were some among us who , had they possessed the least inkling of our project , would , for a paltry hope of reward , have immediately communicated it to the captain .
melville	typee	as soon as two bells were struck , the word was passed for the liberty-men to get into the boat . i lingered behind in the forecastle a moment to take a parting glance at its familiar features , and just as i was about to ascend to the deck my eye happened to light on the bread-barge and beef-kid , which contained the remnants of our last hasty meal . although i had never before thought of providing anything in the way of food for our expedition , as i fully relied upon the fruits of the island to sustain us wherever we might wander , yet i could not resist the inclination i felt to provide luncheon from the relics before me . accordingly i took a double handful of those small , broken , flinty bits of biscuit which generally go by the name of ‘ midshipmen ’ s nuts ’ , and thrust them into the bosom of my frock in which same simple receptacle i had previously stowed away several pounds of tobacco and a few yards of cotton cloth -- articles with which i intended to purchase the good-will of the natives , as soon as we should appear among them after the departure of our vessel .
melville	typee	this last addition to my stock caused a considerable protuberance in front , which i abated in a measure by shaking the bits of bread around my waist , and distributing the plugs of tobacco among the folds of the garment .
melville	typee	hardly had i completed these arrangements when my name was sung out by a dozen voices , and i sprung upon the deck , where i found all the party in the boat , and impatient to shove off . i dropped over the side and seated myself with the rest of the watch in the stern sheets , while the poor larboarders shipped their oars , and commenced pulling us ashore .
melville	typee	this happened to be the rainy season at the islands , and the heavens had nearly the whole morning betokened one of those heavy showers which during this period so frequently occur . the large drops fell bubbling into the water shortly after our leaving the ship , and by the time we had affected a landing it poured down in torrents . we fled for shelter under cover of an immense canoe-house which stood hard by the beach , and waited for the first fury of the storm to pass .
melville	typee	it continued , however , without cessation ; and the monotonous beating of the rain over head began to exert a drowsy influence upon the men , who , throwing themselves here and there upon the large war-canoes , after chatting awhile , all fell asleep .
melville	typee	this was the opportunity we desired , and toby and i availed ourselves of it at once by stealing out of the canoe-house and plunging into the depths of an extensive grove that was in its rear . after ten minutes ’ rapid progress we gained an open space from which we could just descry the ridge we intended to mount looming dimly through the mists of the tropical shower , and distant from us , as we estimated , something more than a mile . our direct course towards it lay through a rather populous part of the bay ; but desirous as we were of evading the natives and securing an unmolested retreat to the mountains , we determined , by taking a circuit through some extensive thickets , to avoid their vicinity altogether .
melville	typee	the heavy rain that still continued to fall without intermission favoured our enterprise , as it drove the islanders into their houses , and prevented any casual meeting with them . our heavy frocks soon became completely saturated with water , and by their weight , and that of the articles we had concealed beneath them , not a little impeded our progress . but it was no time to pause when at any moment we might be surprised by a body of the savages , and forced at the very outset to relinquish our undertaking .
melville	typee	since leaving the canoe-house we had scarcely exchanged a single syllable with one another ; but when we entered a second narrow opening in the wood , and again caught sight of the ridge before us , i took toby by the arm , and pointing along its sloping outline to the lofty heights at its extremity , said in a low tone , ‘ now , toby , not a word , nor a glance backward , till we stand on the summit of yonder mountain -- so no more lingering but let us shove ahead while we can , and in a few hours ’ time we may laugh aloud . you are the lightest and the nimblest , so lead on , and i will follow . ’
melville	typee	‘ all right , brother , ’ said toby , ‘ quick ’ s our play ; only lets keep close together , that ’ s all ; ’ and so saying with a bound like a young roe , he cleared a brook which ran across our path , and rushed forward with a quick step .
melville	typee	when we arrived within a short distance of the ridge , we were stopped by a mass of tall yellow reeds , growing together as thickly as they could stand , and as tough and stubborn as so many rods of steel ; and we perceived , to our chagrin , that they extended midway up the elevation we proposed to ascend .
melville	typee	for a moment we gazed about us in quest of a more practicable route ; it was , however , at once apparent that there was no resource but to pierce this thicket of canes at all hazards . we now reversed our order of march , i , being the heaviest , taking the lead , with a view of breaking a path through the obstruction , while toby fell into the rear .
melville	typee	two or three times i endeavoured to insinuate myself between the canes , and by dint of coaxing and bending them to make some progress ; but a bull-frog might as well have tried to work a passage through the teeth of a comb , and i gave up the attempt in despair .
melville	typee	half wild with meeting an obstacle we had so little anticipated , i threw myself desperately against it , crushing to the ground the canes with which i came in contact , and , rising to my feet again , repeated the action with like effect . twenty minutes of this violent exercise almost exhausted me , but it carried us some way into the thicket ; when toby , who had been reaping the benefit of my labours by following close at my heels , proposed to become pioneer in turn , and accordingly passed ahead with a view of affording me a respite from my exertions . as however with his slight frame he made but bad work of it , i was soon obliged to resume my old place again . on we toiled , the perspiration starting from our bodies in floods , our limbs torn and lacerated with the splintered fragments of the broken canes , until we had proceeded perhaps as far as the middle of the brake , when suddenly it ceased raining , and the atmosphere around us became close and sultry beyond expression . the elasticity of the reeds quickly recovering from the temporary pressure of our bodies , caused them to spring back to their original position ; so that they closed in upon us as we advanced , and prevented the circulation of little air which might otherwise have reached us . besides this , their great height completely shut us out from the view of surrounding objects , and we were not certain but that we might have been going all the time in a wrong direction .
melville	typee	fatigued with my long-continued efforts , and panting for breath , i felt myself completely incapacitated for any further exertion . i rolled up the sleeve of my frock , and squeezed the moisture it contained into my parched mouth . but the few drops i managed to obtain gave me little relief , and i sank down for a moment with a sort of dogged apathy , from which i was aroused by toby , who had devised a plan to free us from the net in which we had become entangled .
melville	typee	he was laying about him lustily with his sheath-knive , lopping the canes right and left , like a reaper , and soon made quite a clearing around us . this sight reanimated me ; and seizing my own knife , i hacked and hewed away without mercy . but alas ! the farther we advanced the thicker and taller , and apparently the more interminable , the reeds became .
melville	typee	i began to think we were fairly snared , and had almost made up my mind that without a pair of wings we should never be able to escape from the toils ; when all at once i discerned a peep of daylight through the canes on my right , and , communicating the joyful tidings to toby , we both fell to with fresh spirit , and speedily opening the passage towards it we found ourselves clear of perplexities , and in the near vicinity of the ridge . after resting for a few moments we began the ascent , and after a little vigorous climbing found ourselves close to its summit . instead however of walking along its ridge , where we should have been in full view of the natives in the vales beneath , and at a point where they could easily intercept us were they so inclined , we cautiously advanced on one side , crawling on our hands and knees , and screened from observation by the grass through which we glided , much in the fashion of a couple of serpents . after an hour employed in this unpleasant kind of locomotion , we started to our feet again and pursued our way boldly along the crest of the ridge .
melville	typee	this salient spur of the lofty elevations that encompassed the bay rose with a sharp angle from the valleys at its base , and presented , with the exception of a few steep acclivities , the appearance of a vast inclined plane , sweeping down towards the sea from the heights in the distance . we had ascended it near the place of its termination and at its lowest point , and now saw our route to the mountains distinctly defined along its narrow crest , which was covered with a soft carpet of verdure , and was in many parts only a few feet wide .
melville	typee	elated with the success which had so far attended our enterprise , and invigorated by the refreshing atmosphere we now inhaled , toby and i in high spirits were making our way rapidly along the ridge , when suddenly from the valleys below which lay on either side of us we heard the distant shouts of the natives , who had just descried us , and to whom our figures , brought in bold relief against the sky , were plainly revealed .
melville	typee	glancing our eyes into these valleys , we perceived their savage inhabitants hurrying to and fro , seemingly under the influence of some sudden alarm , and appearing to the eye scarcely bigger than so many pigmies ; while their white thatched dwellings , dwarfed by the distance , looked like baby-houses . as we looked down upon the islanders from our lofty elevation , we experienced a sense of security ; feeling confident that , should they undertake a pursuit , it would , from the start we now had , prove entirely fruitless , unless they followed us into the mountains , where we knew they cared not to venture .
melville	typee	however , we thought it as well to make the most of our time ; and accordingly , where the ground would admit of it , we ran swiftly along the summit of the ridge , until we were brought to a stand by a steep cliff , which at first seemed to interpose an effectual barrier to our farther advance . by dint of much hard scrambling however , and at some risk to our necks , we at last surmounted it , and continued our fight with unabated celerity .
melville	typee	we had left the beach early in the morning , and after an uninterrupted , though at times difficult and dangerous ascent , during which we had never once turned our faces to the sea , we found ourselves , about three hours before sunset , standing on the top of what seemed to be the highest land on the island , an immense overhanging cliff composed of basaltic rocks , hung round with parasitical plants . we must have been more than three thousand feet above the level of the sea , and the scenery viewed from this height was magnificent .
melville	typee	the lonely bay of nukuheva , dotted here and there with the black hulls of the vessels composing the french squadron , lay reposing at the base of a circular range of elevations , whose verdant sides , perforated with deep glens or diversified with smiling valleys , formed altogether the loveliest view i ever beheld , and were i to live a hundred years , i shall never forget the feeling of admiration which i then experienced .
melville	typee	chapter seven the other side of the mountain -- disappointment -- inventory of articles brought from the ship -- division of the stock of bread -- appearance of the interior of the island -- a discovery -- a ravine and waterfalls -- a sleepless night -- further discoveries -- my illness -- a marquesan landscape
melville	typee	my curiosity had been not a little raised with regard to the description of country we should meet on the other side of the mountains ; and i had supposed , with toby , that immediately on gaining the heights we should be enabled to view the large bays of happar and typee reposing at our feet on one side , in the same way that nukuheva lay spread out below on the other . but here we were disappointed . instead of finding the mountain we had ascended sweeping down in the opposite direction into broad and capacious valleys , the land appeared to retain its general elevation , only broken into a series of ridges and inter-vales which so far as the eye could reach stretched away from us , with their precipitous sides covered with the brightest verdure , and waving here and there with the foliage of clumps of woodland ; among which , however , we perceived none of those trees upon whose fruit we had relied with such certainty .
melville	typee	this was a most unlooked-for discovery , and one that promised to defeat our plans altogether , for we could not think of descending the mountain on the nukuheva side in quest of food . should we for this purpose be induced to retrace our steps , we should run no small chance of encountering the natives , who in that case , if they did nothing worse to us , would be certain to convey us back to the ship for the sake of the reward in calico and trinkets , which we had no doubt our skipper would hold out to them as an inducement to our capture .
melville	typee	what was to be done ? the dolly would not sail perhaps for ten days , and how were we to sustain life during this period ? i bitterly repented our improvidence in not providing ourselves , as we easily might have done , with a supply of biscuits . with a rueful visage i now bethought me of the scanty handful of bread i had stuffed into the bosom of my frock , and felt somewhat desirous to ascertain what part of it had weathered the rather rough usage it had experienced in ascending the mountain . i accordingly proposed to toby that we should enter into a joint examination of the various articles we had brought from the ship .
melville	typee	with this intent we seated ourselves upon the grass ; and a little curious to see with what kind of judgement my companion had filled his frock -- which i remarked seemed about as well lined as my own -- i requested him to commence operations by spreading out its contents .
melville	typee	thrusting his hand , then , into the bosom of this capacious receptacle , he first brought to light about a pound of tobacco , whose component parts still adhered together , the whole outside being covered with soft particles of sea-bread . wet and dripping , it had the appearance of having been just recovered from the bottom of the sea . but i paid slight attention to a substance of so little value to us in our present situation , as soon as i perceived the indications it gave of toby ’ s foresight in laying in a supply of food for the expedition .
melville	typee	i eagerly inquired what quantity he had brought with him , when rummaging once more beneath his garment , he produced a small handful of something so soft , pulpy , and discoloured , that for a few moments he was as much puzzled as myself to tell by what possible instrumentality such a villainous compound had become engendered in his bosom . i can only describe it as a hash of soaked bread and bits of tobacco , brought to a doughy consistency by the united agency of perspiration and rain . but repulsive as it might otherwise have been , i now regarded it as an invaluable treasure , and proceeded with great care to transfer this paste-like mass to a large leaf which i had plucked from a bush beside me . toby informed me that in the morning he had placed two whole biscuits in his bosom , with a view of munching them , should he feel so inclined , during our flight . these were now reduced to the equivocal substance which i had just placed on the leaf .
melville	typee	another dive into the frock brought to view some four or five yards of calico print , whose tasteful pattern was rather disfigured by the yellow stains of the tobacco with which it had been brought in contact . in drawing this calico slowly from his bosom inch by inch , toby reminded me of a juggler performing the feat of the endless ribbon . the next cast was a small one , being a sailor ’ s little ‘ ditty bag ’ , containing needles , thread , and other sewing utensils , then came a razor-case , followed by two or three separate plugs of negro-head , which were fished up from the bottom of the now empty receptacle . these various matters , being inspected , i produced the few things which i had myself brought .
melville	typee	as might have been anticipated from the state of my companion ’ s edible supplies , i found my own in a deplorable condition , and diminished to a quantity that would not have formed half a dozen mouthfuls for a hungry man who was partial enough to tobacco not to mind swallowing it . a few morsels of bread , with a fathom or two of white cotton cloth , and several pounds of choice pigtail , composed the extent of my possessions .
melville	typee	our joint stock of miscellaneous articles were now made up into a compact bundle , which it was agreed we should carry alternately . but the sorry remains of the biscuit were not to be disposed of so summarily : the precarious circumstances in which we were placed made us regard them as something on which very probably , depended the fate of our adventure . after a brief discussion , in which we both of us expressed our resolution of not descending into the bay until the ship ’ s departure , i suggested to my companion that little of it as there was , we should divide the bread into six equal portions , each of which should be a day ’ s allowance for both of us . this proposition he assented to ; so i took the silk kerchief from my neck , and cutting it with my knife into half a dozen equal pieces , proceeded to make an exact division .
melville	typee	at first , toby with a degree of fastidiousness that seemed to me ill-timed , was for picking out the minute particles of tobacco with which the spongy mass was mixed ; but against this proceeding i protested , as by such an operation we must have greatly diminished its quantity .
melville	typee	when the division was accomplished , we found that a day ’ s allowance for the two was not a great deal more than what a table-spoon might hold . each separate portion we immediately rolled up in the bit of silk prepared for it , and joining them all together into a small package , i committed them , with solemn injunctions of fidelity , to the custody of toby . for the remainder of that day we resolved to fast , as we had been fortified by a breakfast in the morning ; and now starting again to our feet , we looked about us for a shelter during the night , which , from the appearance of the heavens , promised to be a dark and tempestuous one .
melville	typee	there was no place near us which would in any way answer our purpose , so turning our backs upon nukuheva , we commenced exploring the unknown regions which lay upon the other side of the mountain .
melville	typee	in this direction , as far as our vision extended , not a sign of life , nor anything that denoted even the transient residence of man , could be seen . the whole landscape seemed one unbroken solitude , the interior of the island having apparently been untenanted since the morning of the creation ; and as we advanced through this wilderness , our voices sounded strangely in our ears , as though human accents had never before disturbed the fearful silence of the place , interrupted only by the low murmurings of distant waterfalls .
melville	typee	our disappointment , however , in not finding the various fruits with which we had intended to regale ourselves during our stay in these wilds , was a good deal lessened by the consideration that from this very circumstance we should be much less exposed to a casual meeting with the savage tribes about us , who we knew always dwelt beneath the shadows of those trees which supplied them with food .
melville	typee	we wandered along , casting eager glances into every bush we passed , until just as we had succeeded in mounting one of the many ridges that intersected the ground , i saw in the grass before me something like an indistinctly traced footpath , which appeared to lead along the top of the ridge , and to descend -- with it into a deep ravine about half a mile in advance of us .
melville	typee	robinson crusoe could not have been more startled at the footprint in the sand than we were at this unwelcome discovery . my first impulse was to make as rapid a retreat as possible , and bend our steps in some other direction ; but our curiosity to see whither this path might lead , prompted us to pursue it . so on we went , the track becoming more and more visible the farther we proceeded , until it conducted us to the verge of the ravine , where it abruptly terminated .
melville	typee	‘ and so , ’ said toby , peering down into the chasm , ‘ everyone that travels this path takes a jump here , eh ? ’ ‘ not so , ’ said i , ‘ for i think they might manage to descend without it ; what say you , -- shall we attempt the feat ? ’
melville	typee	‘ and what , in the name of caves and coal-holes , do you expect to find at the bottom of that gulf but a broken neck -- why it looks blacker than our ship ’ s hold , and the roar of those waterfalls down there would batter one ’ s brains to pieces . ’
melville	typee	‘ oh , no , toby , ’ i exclaimed , laughing ; ‘ but there ’ s something to be seen here , that ’ s plain , or there would have been no path , and i am resolved to find out what it is . ’
melville	typee	‘ i will tell you what , my pleasant fellow , ’ rejoined toby quickly , ‘ if you are going to pry into everything you meet with here that excites your curiosity , you will marvellously soon get knocked on the head ; to a dead certainty you will come bang upon a party of these savages in the midst of your discovery-makings , and i doubt whether such an event would particularly delight you , just take my advice for once , and let us ‘ bout ship and steer in some other direction ; besides , it ’ s getting late and we ought to be mooring ourselves for the night . ’
melville	typee	‘ that is just the thing i have been driving at , ’ replied i ; ‘ and i am thinking that this ravine will exactly answer our purpose , for it is roomy , secluded , well watered , and may shelter us from the weather . ’
melville	typee	‘ aye , and from sleep too , and by the same token will give us sore throats , and rheumatisms into the bargain , ’ cried toby , with evident dislike at the idea . ‘ oh , very well then , my lad , ’ said i , ‘ since you will not accompany me , here i go alone . you will see me in the morning ; ’ and advancing to the edge of the cliff upon which we had been standing , i proceeded to lower myself down by the tangled roots which clustered about all the crevices of the rock . as i had anticipated , toby , in spite of his previous remonstrances , followed my example , and dropping himself with the activity of a squirrel from point to point , he quickly outstripped me and effected a landing at the bottom before i had accomplished two-thirds of the descent .
melville	typee	the sight that now greeted us was one that will ever be vividly impressed upon my mind . five foaming streams , rushing through as many gorges , and swelled and turbid by the recent rains , united together in one mad plunge of nearly eighty feet , and fell with wild uproar into a deep black pool scooped out of the gloomy looking rocks that lay piled around , and thence in one collected body dashed down a narrow sloping channel which seemed to penetrate into the very bowels of the earth . overhead , vast roots of trees hung down from the sides of the ravine dripping with moisture , and trembling with the concussions produced by the fall . it was now sunset , and the feeble uncertain light that found its way into these caverns and woody depths heightened their strange appearance , and reminded us that in a short time we should find ourselves in utter darkness .
melville	typee	as soon as i had satisfied my curiosity by gazing at this scene , i fell to wondering how it was that what we had taken for a path should have conducted us to so singular a place , and began to suspect that after all i might have been deceived in supposing it to have been a trick formed by the islanders . this was rather an agreeable reflection than otherwise , for it diminished our dread of accidentally meeting with any of them , and i came to the conclusion that perhaps we could not have selected a more secure hiding-place than this very spot we had so accidentally hit upon .
melville	typee	toby agreed with me in this view of the matter , and we immediately began gathering together the limbs of trees which lay scattered about , with the view of constructing a temporary hut for the night . this we were obliged to build close to the foot of the cataract , for the current of water extended very nearly to the sides of the gorge . the few moments of light that remained we employed in covering our hut with a species of broad-bladed grass that grew in every fissure of the ravine . our hut , if it deserved to be called one , consisted of six or eight of the straightest branches we could find laid obliquely against the steep wall of rock , with their lower ends within a foot of the stream . into the space thus covered over we managed to crawl , and dispose our wearied bodies as best we could .
melville	typee	shall i ever forget that horrid night ! as for poor toby , i could scarcely get a word out of him . it would have been some consolation to have heard his voice , but he lay shivering the live-long night like a man afflicted with the palsy , with his knees drawn up to his head , while his back was supported against the dripping side of the rock . during this wretched night there seemed nothing wanting to complete the perfect misery of our condition . the rain descended in such torrents that our poor shelter proved a mere mockery . in vain did i try to elude the incessant streams that poured upon me ; by protecting one part i only exposed another , and the water was continually finding some new opening through which to drench us .
melville	typee	i have had many a ducking in the course of my life , and in general cared little about it ; but the accumulated horrors of that night , the deathlike coldness of the place , the appalling darkness and the dismal sense of our forlorn condition , almost unmanned me .
melville	typee	it will not be doubted that the next morning we were early risers , and as soon as i could catch the faintest glimpse of anything like daylight i shook my companion by the arm , and told him it was sunrise . poor toby lifted up his head , and after a moment ’ s pause said , in a husky voice , ‘ then , shipmate , my toplights have gone out , for it appears darker now with my eyes open that it did when they were shut . ’
melville	typee	‘ nonsense ! ’ exclaimed i ; ‘ you are not awake yet. ’ ‘ awake ! ’ roared toby in a rage , ‘ awake ! you mean to insinuate i ’ ve been asleep , do you ? it is an insult to a man to suppose he could sleep in such an infernal place as this . ’
melville	typee	by the time i had apologized to my friend for having misconstrued his silence , it had become somewhat more light , and we crawled out of our lair . the rain had ceased , but everything around us was dripping with moisture . we stripped off our saturated garments , and wrung them as dry as we could . we contrived to make the blood circulate in our benumbed limbs by rubbing them vigorously with our hands ; and after performing our ablutions in the stream , and putting on our still wet clothes , we began to think it advisable to break our long fast , it being now twenty-four hours since we had tasted food .
melville	typee	accordingly our day ’ s ration was brought out , and seating ourselves on a detached fragment of rock , we proceeded to discuss it . first we divided it into two equal portions , and carefully rolling one of them up for our evening ’ s repast , divided the remainder again as equally as possible , and then drew lots for the first choice . i could have placed the morsel that fell to my share upon the tip of my finger ; but notwithstanding this i took care that it should be full ten minutes before i had swallowed the last crumb . what a true saying it is that ‘ appetite furnishes the best sauce. ’ there was a flavour and a relish to this small particle of food that under other circumstances it would have been impossible for the most delicate viands to have imparted . a copious draught of the pure water which flowed at our feet served to complete the meal , and after it we rose sensibly refreshed , and prepared for whatever might befall us .
melville	typee	we now carefully examined the chasm in which we had passed the night . we crossed the stream , and gaining the further side of the pool i have mentioned , discovered proofs that the spot must have been visited by some one but a short time previous to our arrival . further observation convinced us that it had been regularly frequented , and , as we afterwards conjectured from particular indications , for the purpose of obtaining a certain root , from which the natives obtained a kind of ointment .
melville	typee	these discoveries immediately determined us to abandon a place which had presented no inducement for us to remain , except the promise of security ; and as we looked about us for the means of ascending again into the upper regions , we at last found a practicable part of the rock , and half an hour ’ s toil carried us to the summit of the same cliff from which the preceding evening we had descended .
melville	typee	i now proposed to toby that instead of rambling about the island , exposing ourselves to discovery at every turn , we should select some place as our fixed abode for as long a period as our food should hold out , build ourselves a comfortable hut , and be as prudent and circumspect as possible . to all this my companion assented , and we at once set about carrying the plan into execution .
melville	typee	with this view , after exploring without success a little glen near us , we crossed several of the ridges of which i have before spoken ; and about noon found ourselves ascending a long and gradually rising slope , but still without having discovered any place adapted to our purpose . low and heavy clouds betokened an approaching storm , and we hurried on to gain a covert in a clump of thick bushes , which appeared to terminate the long ascent . we threw ourselves under the lee of these bushes , and pulling up the long grass that grew around , covered ourselves completely with it , and awaited the shower .
melville	typee	but it did not come as soon as we had expected , and before many minutes my companion was fast asleep , and i was rapidly falling into the same state of happy forgetfulness . just at this juncture , however , down came the rain with the violence that put all thoughts of slumber to flight . although in some measure sheltered , our clothes soon became as wet as ever ; this , after all the trouble we had taken to dry them , was provoking enough : but there was no help for it ; and i recommend all adventurous youths who abandon vessels in romantic islands during the rainy season to provide themselves with umbrellas .
melville	typee	after an hour or so the shower passed away . my companion slept through it all , or at least appeared so to do ; and now that it was over i had not the heart to awaken him . as i lay on my back completely shrouded with verdure , the leafy branches drooping over me , my limbs buried in grass , i could not avoid comparing our situation with that of the interesting babes in the wood . poor little sufferers ! -- no wonder their constitutions broke down under the hardships to which they were exposed .
melville	typee	during the hour or two spent under the shelter of these bushes , i began to feel symptoms which i at once attributed to the exposure of the preceding night . cold shiverings and a burning fever succeeded one another at intervals , while one of my legs was swelled to such a degree , and pained me so acutely , that i half suspected i had been bitten by some venomous reptile , the congenial inhabitant of the chasm from which we had lately emerged . i may here remark by the way -- what i subsequently gleamed -- that all the islands of polynesia enjoy the reputation , in common with the hibernian isle , of being free from the presence of any vipers ; though whether saint patrick ever visited them , is a question i shall not attempt to decide .
melville	typee	as the feverish sensation increased upon me i tossed about , still unwilling to disturb my slumbering companion , from whose side i removed two or three yards . i chanced to push aside a branch , and by so doing suddenly disclosed to my view a scene which even now i can recall with all the vividness of the first impression . had a glimpse of the gardens of paradise been revealed to me , i could scarcely have been more ravished with the sight .
melville	typee	from the spot where i lay transfixed with surprise and delight , i looked straight down into the bosom of a valley , which swept away in long wavy undulations to the blue waters in the distance . midway towards the sea , and peering here and there amidst the foliage , might be seen the palmetto-thatched houses of its inhabitants glistening in the sun that had bleached them to a dazzling whiteness . the vale was more than three leagues in length , and about a mile across at its greatest width .
melville	typee	on either side it appeared hemmed in by steep and green acclivities , which , uniting near the spot where i lay , formed an abrupt and semicircular termination of grassy cliffs and precipices hundreds of feet in height , over which flowed numberless small cascades . but the crowning beauty of the prospect was its universal verdure ; and in this indeed consists , i believe , the peculiar charm of every polynesian landscape . everywhere below me , from the base of the precipice upon whose very verge i had been unconsciously reposing , the surface of the vale presented a mass of foliage , spread with such rich profusion that it was impossible to determine of what description of trees it consisted .
melville	typee	but perhaps there was nothing about the scenery i beheld more impressive than those silent cascades , whose slender threads of water , after leaping down the steep cliffs , were lost amidst the rich herbage of the valley .
melville	typee	over all the landscape there reigned the most hushed repose , which i almost feared to break , lest , like the enchanted gardens in the fairy tale , a single syllable might dissolve the spell . for a long time , forgetful alike of my own situation , and the vicinity of my still slumbering companion , i remained gazing around me , hardly able to comprehend by what means i had thus suddenly been made a spectator of such a scene .
melville	typee	chapter eight the important question , typee or happar ? -- a wild goose chase -- my sufferings -- disheartening situation -- a night in a ravine -- morning meal -- happy idea of toby -- journey towards the valley recovering from my astonishment at the beautiful scene before me , i quickly awakened toby , and informed him of the discovery i had made . together we now repaired to the border of the precipice , and my companion ’ s admiration was equal to my own . a little reflection , however , abated our surprise at coming so unexpectedly upon this valley , since the large vales of happar and typee , lying upon this side of nukuheva , and extending a considerable distance from the sea towards the interior , must necessarily terminate somewhere about this point .
melville	typee	the question now was as to which of those two places we were looking down upon . toby insisted that it was the abode of the happar , and i that it was tenanted by their enemies the ferocious typees . to be sure i was not entirely convinced by my own arguments , but toby ’ s proposition to descend at once into the valley , and partake of the hospitality of its inmates , seemed to me to be risking so much upon the strength of a mere supposition , that i resolved to oppose it until we had more evidence to proceed upon .
melville	typee	the point was one of vital importance , as the natives of happar were not only at peace with nukuheva , but cultivated with its inhabitants the most friendly relations , and enjoyed besides a reputation for gentleness and humanity which led us to expect from them , if not a cordial reception , at least a shelter during the short period we should remain in their territory .
melville	typee	on the other hand , the very name of typee struck a panic into my heart which i did not attempt to disguise . the thought of voluntarily throwing ourselves into the hands of these cruel savages , seemed to me an act of mere madness ; and almost equally so the idea of venturing into the valley , uncertain by which of these two tribes it was inhabited . that the vale at our feet was tenanted by one of them , was a point that appeared to us past all doubt , since we knew that they resided in this quarter , although our information did not enlighten us further .
melville	typee	my companion , however , incapable of resisting the tempting prospect which the place held out of an abundant supply of food and other means of enjoyment , still clung to his own inconsiderate view of the subject , nor could all my reasoning shake it . when i reminded him that it was impossible for either of us to know anything with certainty , and when i dwelt upon the horrible fate we should encounter were we rashly to descend into the valley , and discover too late the error we had committed , he replied by detailing all the evils of our present condition , and the sufferings we must undergo should we continue to remain where we then were .
melville	typee	anxious to draw him away from the subject , if possible -- for i saw that it would be in vain to attempt changing his mind -- i directed his attention to a long bright unwooded tract of land which , sweeping down from the elevations in the interior , descended into the valley before us . i then suggested to him that beyond this ridge might lie a capacious and untenanted valley , abounding with all manner of delicious fruits ; for i had heard that there were several such upon the island , and proposed that we should endeavour to reach it , and if we found our expectations realized we should at once take refuge in it and remain there as long as we pleased .
melville	typee	he acquiesced in the suggestion ; and we immediately , therefore , began surveying the country lying before us , with a view of determining upon the best route for us to pursue ; but it presented little choice , the whole interval being broken into steep ridges , divided by dark ravines , extending in parallel lines at right angles to our direct course . all these we would be obliged to cross before we could hope to arrive at our destination .
melville	typee	a weary journey ! but we decided to undertake it , though , for my own part , i felt little prepared to encounter its fatigues , shivering and burning by turns with the ague and fever ; for i know not how else to describe the alternate sensations i experienced , and suffering not a little from the lameness which afflicted me . added to this was the faintness consequent on our meagre diet -- a calamity in which toby participated to the same extent as myself .
melville	typee	these circumstances , however , only augmented my anxiety to reach a place which promised us plenty and repose , before i should be reduced to a state which would render me altogether unable to perform the journey . accordingly we now commenced it by descending the almost perpendicular side of a steep and narrow gorge , bristling with a thick growth of reeds . here there was but one mode for us to adopt . we seated ourselves upon the ground , and guided our descent by catching at the canes in our path . this velocity with which we thus slid down the side of the ravine soon brought us to a point where we could use our feet , and in a short time we arrived at the edge of the torrent , which rolled impetuously along the bed of the chasm .
melville	typee	after taking a refreshing draught from the water of the stream , we addressed ourselves to a much more difficult undertaking than the last . every foot of our late descent had to be regained in ascending the opposite side of the gorge -- an operation rendered the less agreeable from the consideration that in these perpendicular episodes we did not progress a hundred yards on our journey . but , ungrateful as the task was , we set about it with exemplary patience , and after a snail-like progress of an hour or more , had scaled perhaps one half of the distance , when the fever which had left me for a while returned with such violence , and accompanied by so raging a thirst , that it required all the entreaties of toby to prevent me from losing all the fruits of my late exertion , by precipitating myself madly down the cliffs we had just climbed , in quest of the water which flowed so temptingly at their base . at the moment all my hopes and fears appeared to be merged in this one desire , careless of the consequences that might result from its gratification . i am aware of no feeling , either of pleasure or of pain , that so completely deprives one of an power to resist its impulses , as this same raging thirst .
melville	typee	toby earnestly conjured me to continue the ascent , assuring me that a little more exertion would bring us to the summit , and that then in less than five minutes we should find ourselves at the brink of the stream , which must necessarily flow on the other side of the ridge .
melville	typee	‘ do not , ’ he exclaimed , ‘ turn back , now that we have proceeded thus far ; for i tell you that neither of us will have the courage to repeat the attempt , if once more we find ourselves looking up to where we now are from the bottom of these rocks ! ’
melville	typee	i was not yet so perfectly beside myself as to be heedless of these representations , and therefore toiled on , ineffectually endeavouring to appease the thirst which consumed me , by thinking that in a short time i should be able to gratify it to my heart ’ s content .
melville	typee	at last we gained the top of the second elevation , the loftiest of those i have described as extending in parallel lines between us and the valley we desired to reach . it commanded a view of the whole intervening distance ; and , discouraged as i was by other circumstances , this prospect plunged me into the very depths of despair . nothing but dark and fearful chasms , separated by sharp-crested and perpendicular ridges as far as the eye could reach . could we have stepped from summit to summit of these steep but narrow elevations we could easily have accomplished the distance ; but we must penetrate to the bottom of every yawning gulf , and scale in succession every one of the eminences before us . even toby , although not suffering as i did , was not proof against the disheartening influences of the sight .
melville	typee	but we did not long stand to contemplate it , impatient as i was to reach the waters of the torrent which flowed beneath us . with an insensibility to danger which i can not call to mind without shuddering , we threw ourselves down the depths of the ravine , startling its savage solitudes with the echoes produced by the falling fragments of rock we every moment dislodged from their places , careless of the insecurity of our footing , and reckless whether the slight roots and twigs we clutched at sustained us for the while , or treacherously yielded to our grasp . for my own part , i scarcely knew whether i was helplessly falling from the heights above , or whether the fearful rapidity with which i descended was an act of my own volition .
melville	typee	in a few minutes we reached the foot of the gorge , and kneeling upon a small ledge of dripping rocks , i bent over to the stream . what a delicious sensation was i now to experience ! i paused for a second to concentrate all my capabilities of enjoyment , and then immerged my lips in the clear element before me . had the apples of sodom turned to ashes in my mouth , i could not have felt a more startling revulsion . a single drop of the cold fluid seemed to freeze every drop of blood in my body ; the fever that had been burning in my veins gave place on the instant to death-like chills , which shook me one after another like so many shocks of electricity , while the perspiration produced by my late violent exertions congealed in icy beads upon my forehead . my thirst was gone , and i fairly loathed the water . starting to my feet , the sight of those dank rocks , oozing forth moisture at every crevice , and the dark stream shooting along its dismal channel , sent fresh chills through my shivering frame , and i felt as uncontrollable a desire to climb up towards the genial sunlight as i before had to descend the ravine .
melville	typee	after two hours ’ perilous exertions we stood upon the summit of another ridge , and it was with difficulty i could bring myself to believe that we had ever penetrated the black and yawning chasm which then gaped at our feet . again we gazed upon the prospect which the height commanded , but it was just as depressing as the one which had before met our eyes . i now felt that in our present situation it was in vain for us to think of ever overcoming the obstacles in our way , and i gave up all thoughts of reaching the vale which lay beyond this series of impediments ; while at the same time i could not devise any scheme to extricate ourselves from the difficulties in which we were involved .
melville	typee	the remotest idea of returning to nukuheva , unless assured of our vessel ’ s departure , never once entered my mind , and indeed it was questionable whether we could have succeeded in reaching it , divided as we were from the bay by a distance we could not compute , and perplexed too in our remembrance of localities by our recent wanderings . besides , it was unendurable the thought of retracing our steps and rendering all our painful exertions of no avail .
melville	typee	there is scarcely anything when a man is in difficulties that he is more disposed to look upon with abhorrence than a rightabout retrograde movement -- a systematic going over of the already trodden ground : and especially if he has a love of adventure , such a course appears indescribably repulsive , so long as there remains the least hope to be derived from braving untried difficulties .
melville	typee	it was this feeling that prompted us to descend the opposite side of the elevation we had just scaled , although with what definite object in view it would have been impossible for either of us to tell .
melville	typee	without exchanging a syllable upon the subject , toby and myself simultaneously renounced the design which had lured us thus far -- perceiving in each other ’ s countenances that desponding expression which speaks more eloquently than words .
melville	typee	together we stood towards the close of this weary day in the cavity of the third gorge we had entered , wholly incapacitated for any further exertion , until restored to some degree of strength by food and repose .
melville	typee	we seated ourselves upon the least uncomfortable spot we could select , and toby produced from the bosom of his frock the sacred package . in silence we partook of the small morsel of refreshment that had been left from the morning ’ s repast , and without once proposing to violate the sanctity of our engagement with respect to the remainder , we rose to our feet , and proceeded to construct some sort of shelter under which we might obtain the sleep we so greatly needed .
melville	typee	fortunately the spot was better adapted to our purpose than the one in which we had passed the last wretched night . we cleared away the tall reeds from the small but almost level bit of ground , and twisted them into a low basket-like hut , which we covered with a profusion of long thick leaves , gathered from a tree near at hand . we disposed them thickly all around , reserving only a slight opening that barely permitted us to crawl under the shelter we had thus obtained .
melville	typee	these deep recesses , though protected from the winds that assail the summits of their lofty sides , are damp and chill to a degree that one would hardly anticipate in such a climate ; and being unprovided with anything but our woollen frocks and thin duck trousers to resist the cold of the place , we were the more solicitous to render our habitation for the night as comfortable as we could . accordingly , in addition to what we had already done , we plucked down all the leaves within our reach and threw them in a heap over our little hut , into which we now crept , raking after us a reserved supply to form our couch .
melville	typee	that night nothing but the pain i suffered prevented me from sleeping most refreshingly . as it was , i caught two or three naps , while toby slept away at my side as soundly as though he had been sandwiched between two holland sheets . luckily it did not rain , and we were preserved from the misery which a heavy shower would have occasioned us . in the morning i was awakened by the sonorous voice of my companion ringing in my ears and bidding me rise . i crawled out from our heap of leaves , and was astonished at the change which a good night ’ s rest had wrought in his appearance . he was as blithe and joyous as a young bird , and was staying the keenness of his morning ’ s appetite by chewing the soft bark of a delicate branch he held in his hand , and he recommended the like to me as an admirable antidote against the gnawings of hunger .
melville	typee	for my own part , though feeling materially better than i had done the preceding evening , i could not look at the limb that had pained me so violently at intervals during the last twenty-four hours , without experiencing a sense of alarm that i strove in vain to shake off . unwilling to disturb the flow of my comrade ’ s spirits , i managed to stifle the complaints to which i might otherwise have given vent , and calling upon him good-humouredly to speed our banquet , i prepared myself for it by washing in the stream . this operation concluded , we swallowed , or rather absorbed , by a peculiar kind of slow sucking process , our respective morsels of nourishment , and then entered into a discussion as to the steps is was necessary for us to pursue .
melville	typee	‘ what ’ s to be done now ? ’ inquired i , rather dolefully . ‘ descend into that same valley we descried yesterday. ’ rejoined toby , with a rapidity and loudness of utterance that almost led me to suspect he had been slyly devouring the broadside of an ox in some of the adjoining thickets . ‘ what else , ’ he continued , ‘ remains for us to do but that , to be sure ? why , we shall both starve to a certainty if we remain here ; and as to your fears of those typees -- depend upon it , it is all nonsense . ’
melville	typee	‘ it is impossible that the inhabitants of such a lovely place as we saw can be anything else but good fellows ; and if you choose rather to perish with hunger in one of these soppy caverns , i for one prefer to chance a bold descent into the valley , and risk the consequences ’ .
melville	typee	‘ and who is to pilot us thither , ’ i asked , ‘ even if we should decide upon the measure you propose ? are we to go again up and down those precipices that we crossed yesterday , until we reach the place we started from , and then take a flying leap from the cliffs to the valley ? ’
melville	typee	‘ faith , i didn ’ t think of that , ’ said toby ; ‘ sure enough , both sides of the valley appeared to be hemmed in by precipices , didn ’ t they ? ’ ‘ yes , ’ answered i , ‘ as steep as the sides of a line-of-battle ship , and about a hundred times as high. ’ my companion sank his head upon his breast , and remained for a while in deep thought . suddenly he sprang to his feet , while his eyes lighted up with that gleam of intelligence that marks the presence of some bright idea .
melville	typee	‘ yes , yes , ’ he exclaimed ; ‘ the streams all run in the same direction , and must necessarily flow into the valley before they reach the sea ; all we have to do is just to follow this stream , and sooner or later it will lead us into the vale . ’
melville	typee	‘ you are right , toby , ’ i exclaimed , ‘ you are right ; it must conduct us thither , and quickly too ; for , see with what a steep inclination the water descends. ’ ‘ it does , indeed , ’ burst forth my companion , overjoyed at my verification of his theory , ‘ it does indeed ; why , it is as plain as a pike-staff . let us proceed at once ; come , throw away all those stupid ideas about the typees , and hurrah for the lovely valley of the happars . ’
melville	typee	‘ you will have it to be happar , i see , my dear fellow ; pray heaven you may not find yourself deceived , ’ observed i , with a shake of my head . ‘ amen to all that , and much more , ’ shouted toby , rushing forward ; ‘ but happar it is , for nothing else than happar can it be . so glorious a valley -- such forests of bread-fruit trees -- such groves of cocoanut -- such wilderness of guava-bushes ! ah ! shipmate ! don ’ t linger behind : in the name of all delightful fruits , i am dying to be at them . come on , come on ; shove ahead , there ’ s a lively lad ; never mind the rocks ; kick them out of the way , as i do ; and tomorrow , old fellow , take my word for it , we shall be in clover . come on ; ’ and so saying , he dashed along the ravine like a madman , forgetting my inability to keep up with him . in a few minutes , however , the exuberance of his spirits abated , and , pausing for a while , he permitted me to overtake him .
melville	typee	chapter nine perilous passage of the ravine -- descent into the valley the fearless confidence of toby was contagious , and i began to adopt the happar side of the question . i could not , however , overcome a certain feeling of trepidation as we made our way along these gloomy solitudes . our progress , at first comparatively easy , became more and more difficult . the bed of the watercourse was covered with fragments of broken rocks , which had fallen from above , offering so many obstructions to the course of the rapid stream , which vexed and fretted about them , -- forming at intervals small waterfalls , pouring over into deep basins , or splashing wildly upon heaps of stones .
melville	typee	from the narrowness of the gorge , and the steepness of its sides , there was no mode of advancing but by wading through the water ; stumbling every moment over the impediments which lay hidden under its surface , or tripping against the huge roots of trees . but the most annoying hindrance we encountered was from a multitude of crooked boughs , which , shooting out almost horizontally from the sides of the chasm , twisted themselves together in fantastic masses almost to the surface of the stream , affording us no passage except under the low arches which they formed . under these we were obliged to crawl on our hands and feet , sliding along the oozy surface of the rocks , or slipping into the deep pools , and with scarce light enough to guide us . occasionally we would strike our heads against some projecting limb of a tree ; and while imprudently engaged in rubbing the injured part , would fall sprawling amongst flinty fragments , cutting and bruising ourselves , whilst the unpitying waters flowed over our prostrate bodies . belzoni , worming himself through the subterranean passages of the egyptian catacombs , could not have met with great impediments than those we here encountered . but we struggled against them manfully , well knowing our only hope lay in advancing .
melville	typee	towards sunset we halted at a spot where we made preparations for passing the night . here we constructed a hut , in much the same way as before , and crawling into it , endeavoured to forget our sufferings . my companion , i believe , slept pretty soundly ; but at day break , when we rolled out of our dwelling , i felt nearly disqualified for any further efforts . toby prescribed as a remedy for my illness the contents of one of our little silk packages , to be taken at once in a single dose . to this species of medical treatment , however , i would by no means accede , much as he insisted upon it ; and so we partook of our usual morsel , and silently resumed our journey . it was now the fourth day since we left nukuheva , and the gnawings of hunger became painfully acute . we were fain to pacify them by chewing the tender bark of roots and twigs , which , if they did not afford us nourishment , were at least sweet and pleasant to the taste .
melville	typee	our progress along the steep watercourse was necessarily slow , and by noon we had not advanced more than a mile . it was somewhere near this part of the day that the noise of falling waters , which we had faintly caught in the early morning , became more distinct ; and it was not long before we were arrested by a rocky precipice of nearly a hundred feet in depth , that extended all across the channel , and over which the wild stream poured in an unbroken leap . on each hand the walls of the ravine presented their overhanging sides both above and below the fall , affording no means whatever of avoiding the cataract by taking a circuit round it .
melville	typee	‘ what ’ s to be done now , toby ? ’ said i . ‘ why , ’ rejoined he , ‘ as we can not retreat , i suppose we must keep shoving along. ’ ‘ very true , my dear toby ; but how do you purpose accomplishing that desirable object ? ’
melville	typee	‘ by jumping from the top of the fall , if there be no other way , ’ unhesitatingly replied my companion : ‘ it will be much the quickest way of descent ; but as you are not quite as active as i am , we will try some other way . ’
melville	typee	and , so saying , he crept cautiously along and peered over into the abyss , while i remained wondering by what possible means we could overcome this apparently insuperable obstruction . as soon as my companion had completed his survey , i eagerly inquired the result .
melville	typee	‘ the result of my observations you wish to know , do you ? ’ began toby , deliberately , with one of his odd looks : ‘ well , my lad , the result of my observations is very quickly imparted . it is at present uncertain which of our two necks will have the honour to be broken first ; but about a hundred to one would be a fair bet in favour of the man who takes the first jump . ’
melville	typee	‘ then it is an impossible thing , is it ? ’ inquired i gloomily . ‘ no , shipmate ; on the contrary , it is the easiest thing in life : the only awkward point is the sort of usage which our unhappy limbs may receive when we arrive at the bottom , and what sort of travelling trim we shall be in afterwards . but follow me now , and i will show you the only chance we have. ’ with this he conducted me to the verge of the cataract , and pointed along the side of the ravine to a number of curious looking roots , some three or four inches in thickness , and several feet long , which , after twisting among the fissures of the rock , shot perpendicularly from it and ran tapering to a point in the air , hanging over the gulf like so many dark icicles . they covered nearly the entire surface of one side of the gorge , the lowest of them reaching even to the water . many were moss grown and decayed , with their extremities snapped short off , and those in the immediate vicinity of the fall were slippery with moisture .
melville	typee	toby ’ s scheme , and it was a desperate one , was to entrust ourselves to these treacherous-looking roots , and by slipping down from one to another to gain the bottom . ‘ are you ready to venture it ? ’ asked toby , looking at me earnestly but without saying a word as to the practicability of the plan .
melville	typee	‘ i am , ’ was my reply ; for i saw it was our only resource if we wished to advance , and as for retreating , all thoughts of that sort had been long abandoned .
melville	typee	after i had signified my assent , toby , without uttering a a single word , crawled along the dripping ledge until he gained a point from whence he could just reach one of the largest of the pendant roots ; he shook it -- it quivered in his grasp , and when he let it go it twanged in the air like a strong , wire sharply struck . satisfied by his scrutiny , my light limbed companion swung himself nimbly upon it , and twisting his legs round it in sailor fashion , slipped down eight or ten feet , where his weight gave it a motion not un-like that of a pendulum . he could not venture to descend any further ; so holding on with one hand , he with the other shook one by one all the slender roots around him , and at last , finding one which he thought trustworthy , shifted him self to it and continued his downward progress .
melville	typee	so far so well ; but i could not avoid comparing my heavier frame and disabled condition with his light figure and remarkable activity ; but there was no help for it , and in less than a minute ’ s time i was swinging directly over his head . as soon as his upturned eyes caught a glimpse of me , he exclaimed in his usual dry tone , for the danger did not seem to daunt him in the least , ‘ mate , do me the kindness not to fall until i get out of your way ; ’ and then swinging himself more on one side , he continued his descent . in the mean time i cautiously transferred myself from the limb down which i had been slipping to a couple of others that were near it , deeming two strings to my bow better than one , and taking care to test their strength before i trusted my weight to them .
melville	typee	on arriving towards the end of the second stage in this vertical journey , and shaking the long roots which were round me , to my consternation they snapped off one after another like so many pipe stems , and fell in fragments against the side of the gulf , splashing at last into the waters beneath .
melville	typee	as one after another the treacherous roots yielded to my grasp , and fell into the torrent , my heart sunk within me . the branches on which i was suspended over the yawning chasm swang to and fro in the air , and i expected them every moment to snap in twain . appalled at the dreadful fate that menaced me , i clutched frantically at the only large root which remained near me , but in vain ; i could not reach it , though my fingers were within a few inches of it . again and again i tried to reach it , until at length , maddened with the thought of my situation , i swayed myself violently by striking my foot against the side of the rock , and at the instant that i approached the large root caught desperately at it , and transferred myself to it . it vibrated violently under the sudden weight , but fortunately did not give way .
melville	typee	my brain grew dizzy with the idea of the frightful risk i had just run , and i involuntarily closed my eyes to shut out the view of the depth beneath me . for the instant i was safe , and i uttered a devout ejaculation of thanksgiving for my escape .
melville	typee	‘ pretty well done , ’ shouted toby underneath me ; ‘ you are nimbler than i thought you to be -- hopping about up there from root to root like any young squirrel . as soon as you have diverted yourself sufficiently , i would advise you to proceed . ’
melville	typee	‘ aye , aye , toby , all in good time : two or three more such famous roots as this , and i shall be with you. ’ the residue of my downward progress was comparatively easy ; the roots were in greater abundance , and in one or two places jutting out points of rock assisted me greatly . in a few moments i was standing by the side of my companion .
melville	typee	substituting a stout stick for the one i had thrown aside at the top of the precipice , we now continued our course along the bed of the ravine . soon we were saluted by a sound in advance , that grew by degrees louder and louder , as the noise of the cataract we were leaving behind gradually died on our ears .
melville	typee	‘ another precipice for us , toby. ’ ‘ very good ; we can descend them , you know -- come on. ’ nothing indeed appeared to depress or intimidate this intrepid fellow . typees or niagaras , he was as ready to engage one as the other , and i could not avoid a thousand times congratulating myself upon having such a companion in an enterprise like the present .
melville	typee	after an hour ’ s painful progress , we reached the verge of another fall , still loftier than the preceding and flanked both above and below with the same steep masses of rock , presenting , however , here and there narrow irregular ledges , supporting a shallow soil , on which grew a variety of bushes and trees , whose bright verdure contrasted beautifully with the foamy waters that flowed between them .
melville	typee	toby , who invariably acted as pioneer , now proceeded to reconnoitre . on his return , he reported that the shelves of rock on our right would enable us to gain with little risk the bottom of the cataract . accordingly , leaving the bed of the stream at the very point where it thundered down , we began crawling along one of those sloping ledges until it carried us to within a few feet of another that inclined downwards at a still sharper angle , and upon which , by assisting each other we managed to alight in safety . we warily crept along this , steadying ourselves by the naked roots of the shrubs that clung to every fissure . as we proceeded , the narrow path became still more contracted , rendering it difficult for us to maintain our footing , until suddenly , as we reached an angle of the wall of rock where we had expected it to widen , we perceived to our consternation that a yard or two further on it abruptly terminated at a place we could not possibly hope to pass .
melville	typee	toby as usual led the van , and in silence i waited to learn from him how he proposed to extricate us from this new difficulty . ‘ well , my boy , ’ i exclaimed , after the expiration of several minutes , during which time my companion had not uttered a word , ‘ what ’ s to be done now ? ’
melville	typee	he replied in a tranquil tone , that probably the best thing we could do in our present strait was to get out of it as soon as possible . ‘ yes , my dear toby , but tell me how we are to get out of it . ’
melville	typee	‘ something in this sort of style , ’ he replied , and at the same moment to my horror he slipped sideways off the rocks and , as i then thought , by good fortune merely , alighted among the spreading branches of a species of palm tree , that shooting its hardy roots along a ledge below , curved its trunk upwards into the air , and presented a thick mass of foliage about twenty feet below the spot where we had thus suddenly been brought to a standstill . i involuntarily held my breath , expecting to see the form of my companion , after being sustained for a moment by the branches of the tree , sink through their frail support , and fall headlong to the bottom . to my surprise and joy , however , he recovered himself , and disentangling his limbs from the fractured branches , he peered out from his leafy bed , and shouted lustily , ‘ come on , my hearty there is no other alternative ! ’ and with this he ducked beneath the foliage , and slipping down the trunk , stood in a moment at least fifty feet beneath me , upon the broad shelf of rock from which sprung the tree he had descended .
melville	typee	what would i not have given at that moment to have been by his side . the feat he had just accomplished seemed little less than miraculous , and i could hardly credit the evidence of my senses when i saw the wide distance that a single daring act had so suddenly placed between us .
melville	typee	toby ’ s animating ‘ come on ’ again sounded in my ears , and dreading to lose all confidence in myself if i remained meditating upon the step , i once more gazed down to assure myself of the relative bearing of the tree and my own position , and then closing my eyes and uttering one comprehensive ejaculation of prayer , i inclined myself over towards the abyss , and after one breathless instant fell with a crash into the tree , the branches snapping and cracking with my weight , as i sunk lower and lower among them , until i was stopped by coming in contact with a sturdy limb .
melville	typee	in a few moments i was standing at the foot of the tree manipulating myself all over with a view of ascertaining the extent of the injuries i had received . to my surprise the only effects of my feat were a few slight contusions too trifling to care about . the rest of our descent was easily accomplished , and in half an hour after regaining the ravine we had partaken of our evening morsel , built our hut as usual , and crawled under its shelter .
melville	typee	the next morning , in spite of our debility and the agony of hunger under which we were now suffering , though neither of us confessed to the fact , we struggled along our dismal and still difficult and dangerous path , cheered by the hope of soon catching a glimpse of the valley before us , and towards evening the voice of a cataract which had for some time sounded like a low deep bass to the music of the smaller waterfalls , broke upon our ears in still louder tones , and assured us that we were approaching its vicinity .
melville	typee	that evening we stood on the brink of a precipice , over which the dark stream bounded in one final leap of full 300 feet . the sheer descent terminated in the region we so long had sought . on each side of the fall , two lofty and perpendicular bluffs buttressed the sides of the enormous cliff , and projected into the sea of verdure with which the valley waved , and a range of similar projecting eminences stood disposed in a half circle about the head if the vale . a thick canopy of trees hung over the very verge of the fall , leaving an arched aperture for the passage of the waters , which imparted a strange picturesqueness to the scene .
melville	typee	the valley was now before us ; but instead of being conducted into its smiling bosom by the gradual descent of the deep watercourse we had thus far pursued , all our labours now appeared to have been rendered futile by its abrupt termination . but , bitterly disappointed , we did not entirely despair .
melville	typee	as it was now near sunset we determined to pass the night where we were , and on the morrow , refreshed by sleep , and by eating at one meal all our stock of food , to accomplish a descent into the valley , or perish in the attempt .
melville	typee	we laid ourselves down that night on a spot , the recollection of which still makes me shudder . a small table of rock which projected over the precipice on one side of the stream , and was drenched by the spray of the fall , sustained a huge trunk of a tree which must have been deposited there by some heavy freshet . it lay obliquely , with one end resting on the rock and the other supported by the side of the ravine . against it we placed in a sloping direction a number of the half decayed boughs that were strewn about , and covering the whole with twigs and leaves , awaited the morning ’ s light beneath such shelter as it afforded .
melville	typee	during the whole of this night the continual roaring of the cataract -- the dismal moaning of the gale through the trees -- the pattering of the rain , and the profound darkness , affected my spirits to a degree which nothing had ever before produced . wet , half famished , and chilled to the heart with the dampness of the place , and nearly wild with the pain i endured , i fairly cowered down to the earth under this multiplication of hardships , and abandoned myself to frightful anticipations of evil ; and my companion , whose spirit at last was a good deal broken , scarcely uttered a word during the whole night .
melville	typee	at length the day dawned upon us , and rising from our miserable pallet , we stretched our stiffened joints , and after eating all that remained of our bread , prepared for the last stage of our journey . i will not recount every hair-breadth escape , and every fearful difficulty that occurred before we succeeded in reaching the bosom of the valley . as i have already described similar scenes , it will be sufficient to say that at length , after great toil and great dangers , we both stood with no limbs broken at the head of that magnificent vale which five days before had so suddenly burst upon my sight , and almost beneath the shadow of those very cliffs from whose summits we had gazed upon the prospect .
melville	typee	chapter ten the head of the valley -- cautious advance -- a path -- fruit -- discovery of two of the natives -- their singular conduct -- approach towards the inhabited parts of the vale -- sensation produced by our appearance -- reception at the house of one of the natives
melville	typee	how to obtain the fruit which we felt convinced must grow near at hand was our first thought . typee or happar ? a frightful death at the hands of the fiercest of cannibals , or a kindly reception from a gentler race of savages ? which ? but it was too late now to discuss a question which would so soon be answered .
melville	typee	the part of the valley in which we found ourselves appeared to be altogether uninhabited . an almost impenetrable thicket extended from side to side , without presenting a single plant affording the nourishment we had confidently calculated upon ; and with this object , we followed the course of the stream , casting quick glances as we proceeded into the thick jungles on each hand . my companion -- to whose solicitations i had yielded in descending into the valley -- now that the step was taken , began to manifest a degree of caution i had little expected from him . he proposed that in the event of our finding an adequate supply of fruit , we should remain in this unfrequented portion of the country -- where we should run little chance of being surprised by its occupants , whoever they might be -- until sufficiently recruited to resume our journey ; when laying a store of food equal to our wants , we might easily regain the bay of nukuheva , after the lapse of a sufficient interval to ensure the departure of our vessel .
melville	typee	i objected strongly to this proposition , plausible as it was , as the difficulties of the route would be almost insurmountable , unacquainted as we were with the general bearings of the country , and i reminded my companion of the hardships which we had already encountered in our uncertain wanderings ; in a word , i said that since we had deemed it advisable to enter the valley , we ought manfully to face the consequences , whatever they might be ; the more especially as i was convinced there was no alternative left us but to fall in with the natives at once , and boldly risk the reception they might give us ; and that as to myself , i felt the necessity of rest and shelter , and that until i had obtained them , i should be wholly unable to encounter such sufferings as we had lately passed through . to the justice of these observations toby somewhat reluctantly assented .
melville	typee	we were surprised that , after moving as far as we had along the valley , we should still meet with the same impervious thickets ; and thinking , that although the borders of the stream might be lined for some distance with them , yet beyond there might be more open ground , i requested toby to keep a bright look-out upon one side , while i did the same on the other , in order to discover some opening in the bushes , and especially to watch for the slightest appearance of a path or anything else that might indicate the vicinity of the islanders .
melville	typee	what furtive and anxious glances we cast into those dim-looking shadows ! with what apprehensions we proceeded , ignorant at what moment we might be greeted by the javelin of some ambushed savage . at last my companion paused , and directed my attention to a narrow opening in the foliage . we struck into it , and it soon brought us by an indistinctly traced path to a comparatively clear space , at the further end of which we descried a number of the trees , the native name of which is ‘ annuee ’ , and which bear a most delicious fruit . what a race ! i hobbling over the ground like some decrepid wretch , and toby leaping forward like a greyhound . he quickly cleared one of the trees on which there were two or three of the fruit , but to our chagrin they proved to be much decayed ; the rinds partly opened by the birds , and their hearts half devoured . however , we quickly despatched them , and no ambrosia could have been more delicious .
melville	typee	we looked about us uncertain whither to direct our steps , since the path we had so far followed appeared to be lost in the open space around us . at last we resolved to enter a grove near at hand , and had advanced a few rods , when , just upon its skirts , i picked up a slender bread-fruit shoot perfectly green , and with the tender bark freshly stripped from it . it was still slippery with moisture , and appeared as if it had been but that moment thrown aside . i said nothing , but merely held it up to toby , who started at this undeniable evidence of the vicinity of the savages .
melville	typee	the plot was now thickening. -- a short distance further lay a little faggot of the same shoots bound together with a strip of bark . could it have been thrown down by some solitary native , who , alarmed at seeing us , had hurried forward to carry the tidings of our approach to his countrymen ? -- typee or happar ? -- but it was too late to recede , so we moved on slowly , my companion in advance casting eager glances under the trees on each side , until all at once i saw him recoil as if stung by an adder . sinking on his knee , he waved me off with one hand , while with the other he held aside some intervening leaves , and gazed intently at some object .
melville	typee	disregarding his injunction , i quickly approached him and caught a glimpse of two figures partly hidden by the dense foliage ; they were standing close together , and were perfectly motionless . they must have previously perceived us , and withdrawn into the depths of the wood to elude our observation .
melville	typee	my mind was at once made up . dropping my staff , and tearing open the package of things we had brought from the ship , i unrolled the cotton cloth , and holding it in one hand picked with the other a twig from the bushes beside me , and telling toby to follow my example , i broke through the covert and advanced , waving the branch in token of peace towards the shrinking forms before me . they were a boy and a girl , slender and graceful , and completely naked , with the exception of a slight girdle of bark , from which depended at opposite points two of the russet leaves of the bread-fruit tree . an arm of the boy , half screened from sight by her wild tresses , was thrown about the neck of the girl , while with the other he held one of her hands in his ; and thus they stood together , their heads inclined forward , catching the faint noise we made in our progress , and with one foot in advance , as if half inclined to fly from our presence .
melville	typee	as we drew near , their alarm evidently increased . apprehensive that they might fly from us altogether , i stopped short and motioned them to advance and receive the gift i extended towards them , but they would not ; i then uttered a few words of their language with which i was acquainted , scarcely expected that they would understand me , but to show that we had not dropped from the clouds upon them . this appeared to give them a little confidence , so i approached nearer , presenting the cloth with one hand , and holding the bough with the other , while they slowly retreated . at last they suffered us to approach so near to them that we were enabled to throw the cotton cloth across their shoulders , giving them to understand that it was theirs , and by a variety of gestures endeavouring to make them understand that we entertained the highest possible regard for them .
melville	typee	the frightened pair now stood still , whilst we endeavoured to make them comprehend the nature of our wants . in doing this toby went through with a complete series of pantomimic illustrations -- opening his mouth from ear to ear , and thrusting his fingers down his throat , gnashing his teeth and rolling his eyes about , till i verily believe the poor creatures took us for a couple of white cannibals who were about to make a meal of them . when , however , they understood us , they showed no inclination to relieve our wants . at this juncture it began to rain violently , and we motioned them to lead us to some place of shelter . with this request they appeared willing to comply , but nothing could evince more strongly the apprehension with which they regarded us , than the way in which , whilst walking before us , they kept their eyes constantly turned back to watch every movement we made , and even our very looks .
melville	typee	‘ typee or happar , toby ? ’ asked i as we walked after them . ‘ of course happar , ’ he replied , with a show of confidence which was intended to disguise his doubts . ‘ we shall soon know , ’ i exclaimed ; and at the same moment i stepped forward towards our guides , and pronouncing the two names interrogatively and pointing to the lowest part of the valley , endeavoured to come to the point at once . they repeated the words after me again and again , but without giving any peculiar emphasis to either , so that i was completely at a loss to understand them ; for a couple of wilier young things than we afterwards found them to have been on this particular occasion never probably fell in any traveller ’ s way .
melville	typee	more and more curious to ascertain our fate , i now threw together in the form of a question the words ‘ happar ’ and ‘ motarkee ’ , the latter being equivalent to the word ‘ good ’ . the two natives interchanged glances of peculiar meaning with one another at this , and manifested no little surprise ; but on the repetition of the question after some consultation together , to the great joy of toby , they answered in the affirmative . toby was now in ecstasies , especially as the young savages continued to reiterate their answer with great energy , as though desirous of impressing us with the idea that being among the happars , we ought to consider ourselves perfectly secure .
melville	typee	although i had some lingering doubts , i feigned great delight with toby at this announcement , while my companion broke out into a pantomimic abhorrence of typee , and immeasurable love for the particular valley in which we were ; our guides all the while gazing uneasily at one another as if at a loss to account for our conduct .
melville	typee	they hurried on , and we followed them ; until suddenly they set up a strange halloo , which was answered from beyond the grove through which we were passing , and the next moment we entered upon some open ground , at the extremity of which we descried a long , low hut , and in front of it were several young girls . as soon as they perceived us they fled with wild screams into the adjoining thickets , like so many startled fawns . a few moments after the whole valley resounded with savage outcries , and the natives came running towards us from every direction .
melville	typee	had an army of invaders made an irruption into their territory they could not have evinced greater excitement . we were soon completely encircled by a dense throng , and in their eager desire to behold us they almost arrested our progress ; an equal number surrounded our youthful guides , who with amazing volubility appeared to be detailing the circumstances which had attended their meeting with us . every item of intelligence appeared to redouble the astonishment of the islanders , and they gazed at us with inquiring looks .
melville	typee	at last we reached a large and handsome building of bamboos , and were by signs told to enter it , the natives opening a lane for us through which to pass ; on entering without ceremony , we threw our exhausted frames upon the mats that covered the floor . in a moment the slight tenement was completely full of people , whilst those who were unable to obtain admittance gazed at us through its open cane-work .
melville	typee	it was now evening , and by the dim light we could just discern the savage countenances around us , gleaming with wild curiosity and wonder ; the naked forms and tattooed limbs of brawny warriors , with here and there the slighter figures of young girls , all engaged in a perfect storm of conversation , of which we were of course the one only theme , whilst our recent guides were fully occupied in answering the innumerable questions which every one put to them . nothing can exceed the fierce gesticulation of these people when animated in conversation , and on this occasion they gave loose to all their natural vivacity , shouting and dancing about in a manner that well nigh intimidated us .
melville	typee	close to where we lay , squatting upon their haunches , were some eight or ten noble-looking chiefs -- for such they subsequently proved to be -- who , more reserved than the rest , regarded us with a fixed and stern attention , which not a little discomposed our equanimity . one of them in particular , who appeared to be the highest in rank , placed himself directly facing me , looking at me with a rigidity of aspect under which i absolutely quailed . he never once opened his lips , but maintained his severe expression of countenance , without turning his face aside for a single moment . never before had i been subjected to so strange and steady a glance ; it revealed nothing of the mind of the savage , but it appeared to be reading my own .
melville	typee	after undergoing this scrutiny till i grew absolutely nervous , with a view of diverting it if possible , and conciliating the good opinion of the warrior , i took some tobacco from the bosom of my frock and offered it to him . he quietly rejected the proffered gift , and , without speaking , motioned me to return it to its place .
melville	typee	in my previous intercourse with the natives of nukuheva and tior , i had found that the present of a small piece of tobacco would have rendered any of them devoted to my service . was this act of the chief a token of his enmity ? typee or happar ? i asked within myself . i started , for at the same moment this identical question was asked by the strange being before me . i turned to toby , the flickering light of a native taper showed me his countenance pale with trepidation at this fatal question . i paused for a second , and i know not by what impulse it was that i answered ‘ typee ’ . the piece of dusky statuary nodded in approval , and then murmured ‘ motarkee ! ’ ‘ motarkee , ’ said i , without further hesitation ‘ typee motarkee . ’
melville	typee	what a transition ! the dark figures around us leaped to their feet , clapped their hands in transport , and shouted again and again the talismanic syllables , the utterance of which appeared to have settled everything .
melville	typee	when this commotion had a little subsided , the principal chief squatted once more before me , and throwing himself into a sudden rage , poured forth a string of philippics , which i was at no loss to understand , from the frequent recurrence of the word happar , as being directed against the natives of the adjoining valley . in all these denunciations my companion and i acquiesced , while we extolled the character of the warlike typees . to be sure our panegyrics were somewhat laconic , consisting in the repetition of that name , united with the potent adjective ‘ motarkee ’ . but this was sufficient , and served to conciliate the good will of the natives , with whom our congeniality of sentiment on this point did more towards inspiring a friendly feeling than anything else that could have happened .
melville	typee	at last the wrath of the chief evaporated , and in a few moments he was as placid as ever . laying his hand upon his breast , he gave me to understand that his name was ‘ mehevi ’ , and that , in return , he wished me to communicate my appellation . i hesitated for an instant , thinking that it might be difficult for him to pronounce my real name , and then with the most praiseworthy intentions intimated that i was known as ‘ tom ’ . but i could not have made a worse selection ; the chief could not master it . ‘ tommo , ’ ‘ tomma ’ , ‘ tommee ’ , everything but plain ‘ tom ’ . as he persisted in garnishing the word with an additional syllable , i compromised the matter with him at the word ‘ tommo ’ ; and by that name i went during the entire period of my stay in the valley . the same proceeding was gone through with toby , whose mellifluous appellation was more easily caught .
melville	typee	an exchange of names is equivalent to a ratification of good will and amity among these simple people ; and as we were aware of this fact , we were delighted that it had taken place on the present occasion .
melville	typee	reclining upon our mats , we now held a kind of levee , giving audience to successive troops of the natives , who introduced themselves to us by pronouncing their respective names , and retired in high good humour on receiving ours in return . during this ceremony the greatest merriment prevailed nearly every announcement on the part of the islanders being followed by a fresh sally of gaiety , which induced me to believe that some of them at least were innocently diverting the company at our expense , by bestowing upon themselves a string of absurd titles , of the humour of which we were of course entirely ignorant .
melville	typee	all this occupied about an hour , when the throng having a little diminished , i turned to mehevi and gave him to understand that we were in need of food and sleep . immediately the attentive chief addressed a few words to one of the crowd , who disappeared , and returned in a few moments with a calabash of ‘ poee-poee ’ , and two or three young cocoanuts stripped of their husks , and with their shells partly broken . we both of us forthwith placed one of these natural goblets to our lips , and drained it in a moment of the refreshing draught it contained . the poee-poee was then placed before us , and even famished as i was , i paused to consider in what manner to convey it to my mouth .
melville	typee	this staple article of food among the marquese islanders is manufactured from the produce of the bread-fruit tree . it somewhat resembles in its plastic nature our bookbinders ’ paste , is of a yellow colour , and somewhat tart to the taste .
melville	typee	such was the dish , the merits of which i was now eager to discuss . i eyed it wistfully for a moment , and then , unable any longer to stand on ceremony , plunged my hand into the yielding mass , and to the boisterous mirth of the natives drew it forth laden with the poee-poee , which adhered in lengthy strings to every finger . so stubborn was its consistency , that in conveying my heavily-weighted hand to my mouth , the connecting links almost raised the calabash from the mats on which it had been placed . this display of awkwardness -- in which , by-the-bye , toby kept me company -- convulsed the bystanders with uncontrollable laughter .
melville	typee	as soon as their merriment had somewhat subsided , mehevi , motioning us to be attentive , dipped the forefinger of his right hand in the dish , and giving it a rapid and scientific twirl , drew it out coated smoothly with the preparation . with a second peculiar flourish he prevented the poee-poee from dropping to the ground as he raised it to his mouth , into which the finger was inserted and drawn forth perfectly free from any adhesive matter .
melville	typee	this performance was evidently intended for our instruction ; so i again essayed the feat on the principles inculcated , but with very ill success . a starving man , however , little heeds conventional proprieties , especially on a south-sea island , and accordingly toby and i partook of the dish after our own clumsy fashion , beplastering our faces all over with the glutinous compound , and daubing our hands nearly to the wrist . this kind of food is by no means disagreeable to the palate of a european , though at first the mode of eating it may be . for my own part , after the lapse of a few days i became accustomed to its singular flavour , and grew remarkably fond of it .
melville	typee	so much for the first course ; several other dishes followed it , some of which were positively delicious . we concluded our banquet by tossing off the contents of two more young cocoanuts , after which we regaled ourselves with the soothing fumes of tobacco , inhaled from a quaintly carved pipe which passed round the circle .
melville	typee	during the repast , the natives eyed us with intense curiosity , observing our minutest motions , and appearing to discover abundant matter for comment in the most trifling occurrence . their surprise mounted the highest , when we began to remove our uncomfortable garments , which were saturated with rain . they scanned the whiteness of our limbs , and seemed utterly unable to account for the contrast they presented to the swarthy hue of our faces embrowned from a six months ’ exposure to the scorching sun of the line . they felt our skin , much in the same way that a silk mercer would handle a remarkably fine piece of satin ; and some of them went so far in their investigation as to apply the olfactory organ .
melville	typee	their singular behaviour almost led me to imagine that they never before had beheld a white man ; but a few moments ’ reflection convinced me that this could not have been the case ; and a more satisfactory reason for their conduct has since suggested itself to my mind .
melville	typee	deterred by the frightful stories related of its inhabitants , ships never enter this bay , while their hostile relations with the tribes in the adjoining valleys prevent the typees from visiting that section of the island where vessels occasionally lie . at long intervals , however , some intrepid captain will touch on the skirts of the bay , with two or three armed boats ’ crews and accompanied by interpreters . the natives who live near the sea descry the strangers long before they reach their waters , and aware of the purpose for which they come , proclaim loudly the news of their approach . by a species of vocal telegraph the intelligence reaches the inmost recesses of the vale in an inconceivably short space of time , drawing nearly its whole population down to the beach laden with every variety of fruit . the interpreter , who is invariably a ‘ tabooed kanaka ’ * , leaps ashore with the goods intended for barter , while the boats , with their oars shipped , and every man on his thwart , lie just outside the surf , heading off the shore , in readiness at the first untoward event to escape to the open sea . as soon as the traffic is concluded , one of the boats pulls in under cover of the muskets of the others , the fruit is quickly thrown into her , and the transient visitors precipitately retire from what they justly consider so dangerous a vicinity .
melville	typee	* the word ‘ kanaka ’ is at the present day universally used in the south seas by europeans to designate the islanders . in the various dialects of the principal groups it is simply a sexual designation applied to the males ; but it is now used by the natives in their intercourse with foreigners in the same sense in which the latter employ it .
melville	typee	a ‘ tabooed kanaka ’ is an islander whose person has been made to a certain extent sacred by the operation of a singular custom hereafter to be explained . the intercourse occurring with europeans being so restricted , no wonder that the inhabitants of the valley manifested so much curiosity with regard to us , appearing as we did among them under such singular circumstances . i have no doubt that we were the first white men who ever penetrated thus far back into their territories , or at least the first who had ever descended from the head of the vale . what had brought us thither must have appeared a complete mystery to them , and from our ignorance of the language it was impossible for us to enlighten them . in answer to inquiries which the eloquence of their gestures enabled us to comprehend , all that we could reply was , that we had come from nukuheva , a place , be it remembered , with which they were at open war . this intelligence appeared to affect them with the most lively emotions . ‘ nukuheva motarkee ? ’ they asked . of course we replied most energetically in the negative .
melville	typee	then they plied us with a thousand questions , of which we could understand nothing more than that they had reference to the recent movements of the french , against whom they seemed to cherish the most fierce hatred . so eager were they to obtain information on this point , that they still continued to propound their queries long after we had shown that we were utterly unable to answer them . occasionally we caught some indistinct idea of their meaning , when we would endeavour by every method in our power to communicate the desired intelligence . at such times their gratification was boundless , and they would redouble their efforts to make us comprehend them more perfectly . but all in vain ; and in the end they looked at us despairingly , as if we were the receptacles of invaluable information ; but how to come at it they knew not .
melville	typee	after a while the group around us gradually dispersed , and we were left about midnight ( as we conjectured ) with those who appeared to be permanent residents of the house . these individuals now provided us with fresh mats to lie upon , covered us with several folds of tappa , and then extinguishing the tapers that had been burning , threw themselves down beside us , and after a little desultory conversation were soon sound asleep .
melville	typee	chapter eleven midnight reflections -- morning visitors -- a warrior in costume -- a savage aesculapius -- practice of the healing art -- body servant -- a dwelling-house of the valley described -- portraits of its inmates various and conflicting were the thoughts which oppressed me during the silent hours that followed the events related in the preceding chapter . toby , wearied with the fatigues of the day , slumbered heavily by my side ; but the pain under which i was suffering effectually prevented my sleeping , and i remained distressingly alive to all the fearful circumstances of our present situation . was it possible that , after all our vicissitudes , we were really in the terrible valley of typee , and at the mercy of its inmates , a fierce and unrelenting tribe of savages ? typee or happar ? i shuddered when i reflected that there was no longer any room for doubt ; and that , beyond all hope of escape , we were now placed in those very circumstances from the bare thought of which i had recoiled with such abhorrence but a few days before . what might not be our fearful destiny ? to be sure , as yet we had been treated with no violence ; nay , had been even kindly and hospitably entertained . but what dependence could be placed upon the fickle passions which sway the bosom of a savage ? his inconstancy and treachery are proverbial . might it not be that beneath these fair appearances the islanders covered some perfidious design , and that their friendly reception of us might only precede some horrible catastrophe ? how strongly did these forebodings spring up in my mind as i lay restlessly upon a couch of mats surrounded by the dimly revealed forms of those whom i so greatly dreaded !
melville	typee	from the excitement of these fearful thoughts i sank towards morning into an uneasy slumber ; and on awaking , with a start , in the midst of an appalling dream , looked up into the eager countenance of a number of the natives , who were bending over me .
melville	typee	it was broad day ; and the house was nearly filled with young females , fancifully decorated with flowers , who gazed upon me as i rose with faces in which childish delight and curiosity were vividly portrayed . after waking toby , they seated themselves round us on the mats , and gave full play to that prying inquisitiveness which time out of mind has been attributed to the adorable sex .
melville	typee	as these unsophisticated young creatures were attended by no jealous duennas , their proceedings were altogether informal , and void of artificial restraint . long and minute was the investigation with which they honoured us , and so uproarious their mirth , that i felt infinitely sheepish ; and toby was immeasurably outraged at their familiarity .
melville	typee	these lively young ladies were at the same time wonderfully polite and humane ; fanning aside the insects that occasionally lighted on our brows ; presenting us with food ; and compassionately regarding me in the midst of my afflictions . but in spite of all their blandishments , my feelings of propriety were exceedingly shocked , for i could but consider them as having overstepped the due limits of female decorum .
melville	typee	having diverted themselves to their hearts ’ content , our young visitants now withdrew , and gave place to successive troops of the other sex , who continued flocking towards the house until near noon ; by which time i have no doubt that the greater part of the inhabitants of the valley had bathed themselves in the light of our benignant countenances .
melville	typee	at last , when their numbers began to diminish , a superb-looking warrior stooped the towering plumes of his head-dress beneath the low portal , and entered the house . i saw at once that he was some distinguished personage , the natives regarding him with the utmost deference , and making room for him as he approached . his aspect was imposing . the splendid long drooping tail-feathers of the tropical bird , thickly interspersed with the gaudy plumage of the cock , were disposed in an immense upright semicircle upon his head , their lower extremities being fixed in a crescent of guinea-heads which spanned the forehead . around his neck were several enormous necklaces of boar ’ s tusks , polished like ivory , and disposed in such a manner as that the longest and largest were upon his capacious chest . thrust forward through the large apertures in his ears were two small and finely-shaped sperm whale teeth , presenting their cavities in front , stuffed with freshly-plucked leaves , and curiously wrought at the other end into strange little images and devices . these barbaric trinkets , garnished in this manner at their open extremities , and tapering and curving round to a point behind the ear , resembled not a little a pair of cornucopias .
melville	typee	the loins of the warrior were girt about with heavy folds of a dark-coloured tappa , hanging before and behind in clusters of braided tassels , while anklets and bracelets of curling human hair completed his unique costume . in his right hand he grasped a beautifully carved paddle-spear , nearly fifteen feet in length , made of the bright koar-wood , one end sharply pointed , and the other flattened like an oar-blade . hanging obliquely from his girdle by a loop of sinnate was a richly decorated pipe ; the slender reed forming its stem was coloured with a red pigment , and round it , as well as the idol-bowl , fluttered little streamers of the thinnest tappa .
melville	typee	but that which was most remarkable in the appearance of this splendid islander was the elaborate tattooing displayed on every noble limb . all imaginable lines and curves and figures were delineated over his whole body , and in their grotesque variety and infinite profusion i could only compare them to the crowded groupings of quaint patterns we sometimes see in costly pieces of lacework . the most simple and remarkable of all these ornaments was that which decorated the countenance of the chief . two broad stripes of tattooing , diverging from the centre of his shaven crown , obliquely crossed both eyes -- staining the lids -- to a little below each ear , where they united with another stripe which swept in a straight line along the lips and formed the base of the triangle . the warrior , from the excellence of his physical proportions , might certainly have been regarded as one of nature ’ s noblemen , and the lines drawn upon his face may possibly have denoted his exalted rank .
melville	typee	this warlike personage , upon entering the house , seated himself at some distance from the spot where toby and myself reposed , while the rest of the savages looked alternately from us to him , as if in expectation of something they were disappointed in not perceiving . regarding the chief attentively , i thought his lineaments appeared familiar to me . as soon as his full face was turned upon me , and i again beheld its extraordinary embellishment , and met the strange gaze to which i had been subjected the preceding night , i immediately , in spite of the alteration in his appearance , recognized the noble mehevi . on addressing him , he advanced at once in the most cordial manner , and greeting me warmly , seemed to enjoy not a little the effect his barbaric costume had produced upon me .
melville	typee	i forthwith determined to secure , if possible , the good-will of this individual , as i easily perceived he was a man of great authority in his tribe , and one who might exert a powerful influence upon our subsequent fate . in the endeavour i was not repulsed ; for nothing could surpass the friendliness he manifested towards both my companion and myself . he extended his sturdy limbs by our side , and endeavoured to make us comprehend the full extent of the kindly feelings by which he was actuated . the almost insuperable difficulty in communicating to one another our ideas affected the chief with no little mortification . he evinced a great desire to be enlightened with regard to the customs and peculiarities of the far-off country we had left behind us , and to which under the name of maneeka he frequently alluded .
melville	typee	but that which more than any other subject engaged his attention was the late proceedings of the ‘ frannee ’ as he called the french , in the neighbouring bay of nukuheva . this seemed a never-ending theme with him , and one concerning which he was never weary of interrogating us . all the information we succeeded in imparting to him on this subject was little more than that we had seen six men-of-war lying in the hostile bay at the time we had left it . when he received this intelligence , mehevi , by the aid of his fingers , went through a long numerical calculation , as if estimating the number of frenchmen the squadron might contain .
melville	typee	it was just after employing his faculties in this way that he happened to notice the swelling in my limb . he immediately examined it with the utmost attention , and after doing so , despatched a boy who happened to be standing by with some message .
melville	typee	after the lapse of a few moments the stripling re-entered the house with an aged islander , who might have been taken for old hippocrates himself . his head was as bald as the polished surface of a cocoanut shell , which article it precisely resembled in smoothness and colour , while a long silvery beard swept almost to his girdle of bark . encircling his temples was a bandeau of the twisted leaves of the omoo tree , pressed closely over the brows to shield his feeble vision from the glare of the sun . his tottering steps were supported by a long slim staff , resembling the wand with which a theatrical magician appears on the stage , and in one hand he carried a freshly plaited fan of the green leaflets of the cocoanut tree . a flowing robe of tappa , knotted over the shoulder , hung loosely round his stooping form , and heightened the venerableness of his aspect .
melville	typee	mehevi , saluting this old gentleman , motioned him to a seat between us , and then uncovering my limb , desired him to examine it . the leech gazed intently from me to toby , and then proceeded to business . after diligently observing the ailing member , he commenced manipulating it ; and on the supposition probably that the complaint had deprived the leg of all sensation , began to pinch and hammer it in such a manner that i absolutely roared with pain . thinking that i was as capable of making an application of thumps and pinches to the part as any one else , i endeavoured to resist this species of medical treatment . but it was not so easy a matter to get out of the clutches of the old wizard ; he fastened on the unfortunate limb as if it were something for which he had been long seeking , and muttering some kind of incantation continued his discipline , pounding it after a fashion that set me well nigh crazy ; while mehevi , upon the same principle which prompts an affectionate mother to hold a struggling child in a dentist ’ s chair , restrained me in his powerful grasp , and actually encouraged the wretch in this infliction of torture .
melville	typee	almost frantic with rage and pain , i yelled like a bedlamite ; while toby , throwing himself into all the attitudes of a posture-master , vainly endeavoured to expostulate with the natives by signs and gestures . to have looked at my companion , as , sympathizing with my sufferings , he strove to put an end to them , one would have thought that he was the deaf and dumb alphabet incarnated . whether my tormentor yielded to toby ’ s entreaties , or paused from sheer exhaustion , i do not know ; but all at once he ceased his operations , and at the same time the chief relinquishing his hold upon me , i fell back , faint and breathless with the agony i had endured .
melville	typee	my unfortunate limb was now left much in the same condition as a rump-steak after undergoing the castigating process which precedes cooking . my physician , having recovered from the fatigues of his exertions , as if anxious to make amends for the pain to which he had subjected me , now took some herbs out of a little wallet that was suspended from his waist , and moistening them in water , applied them to the inflamed part , stooping over it at the same time , and either whispering a spell , or having a little confidential chat with some imaginary demon located in the calf of my leg . my limb was now swathed in leafy bandages , and grateful to providence for the cessation of hostilities , i was suffered to rest .
melville	typee	mehevi shortly after rose to depart ; but before he went he spoke authoritatively to one of the natives whom he addressed as kory-kory ; and from the little i could understand of what took place , pointed him out to me as a man whose peculiar business thenceforth would be to attend upon my person . i am not certain that i comprehended as much as this at the time , but the subsequent conduct of my trusty body-servant fully assured me that such must have been the case .
melville	typee	i could not but be amused at the manner in which the chief addressed me upon this occasion , talking to me for at least fifteen or twenty minutes as calmly as if i could understand every word that he said . i remarked this peculiarity very often afterwards in many other of the islanders .
melville	typee	mehevi having now departed , and the family physician having likewise made his exit , we were left about sunset with ten or twelve natives , who by this time i had ascertained composed the household of which toby and i were members . as the dwelling to which we had been first introduced was the place of my permanent abode while i remained in the valley , and as i was necessarily placed upon the most intimate footing with its occupants , i may as well here enter into a little description of it and its inhabitants . this description will apply also to nearly all the other dwelling-places in the vale , and will furnish some idea of the generality of the natives .
melville	typee	near one side of the valley , and about midway up the ascent of a rather abrupt rise of ground waving with the richest verdure , a number of large stones were laid in successive courses , to the height of nearly eight feet , and disposed in such a manner that their level surface corresponded in shape with the habitation which was perched upon it . a narrow space , however , was reserved in front of the dwelling , upon the summit of this pile of stones ( called by the natives a ‘ pi-pi ’ ) , which being enclosed by a little picket of canes , gave it somewhat the appearance of a verandah . the frame of the house was constructed of large bamboos planted uprightly , and secured together at intervals by transverse stalks of the light wood of the habiscus , lashed with thongs of bark . the rear of the tenement -- built up with successive ranges of cocoanut boughs bound one upon another , with their leaflets cunningly woven together -- inclined a little from the vertical , and extended from the extreme edge of the ‘ pi-pi ’ to about twenty feet from its surface ; whence the shelving roof -- thatched with the long tapering leaves of the palmetto -- sloped steeply off to within about five feet of the floor ; leaving the eaves drooping with tassel-like appendages over the front of the habitation . this was constructed of light and elegant canes in a kind of open screenwork , tastefully adorned with bindings of variegated sinnate , which served to hold together its various parts . the sides of the house were similarly built ; thus presenting three quarters for the circulation of the air , while the whole was impervious to the rain .
melville	typee	in length this picturesque building was perhaps twelve yards , while in breadth it could not have exceeded as many feet . so much for the exterior ; which , with its wire-like reed-twisted sides , not a little reminded me of an immense aviary .
melville	typee	stooping a little , you passed through a narrow aperture in its front ; and facing you , on entering , lay two long , perfectly straight , and well-polished trunks of the cocoanut tree , extending the full length of the dwelling ; one of them placed closely against the rear , and the other lying parallel with it some two yards distant , the interval between them being spread with a multitude of gaily-worked mats , nearly all of a different pattern . this space formed the common couch and lounging place of the natives , answering the purpose of a divan in oriental countries . here would they slumber through the hours of the night , and recline luxuriously during the greater part of the day . the remainder of the floor presented only the cool shining surfaces of the large stones of which the ‘ pi-pi ’ was composed .
melville	typee	from the ridge-pole of the house hung suspended a number of large packages enveloped in coarse tappa ; some of which contained festival dresses , and various other matters of the wardrobe , held in high estimation . these were easily accessible by means of a line , which , passing over the ridge-pole , had one end attached to a bundle , while with the other , which led to the side of the dwelling and was there secured , the package could be lowered or elevated at pleasure .
melville	typee	against the farther wall of the house were arranged in tasteful figures a variety of spears and javelins , and other implements of savage warfare . outside of the habitation , and built upon the piazza-like area in its front , was a little shed used as a sort of larder or pantry , and in which were stored various articles of domestic use and convenience . a few yards from the pi-pi was a large shed built of cocoanut boughs , where the process of preparing the ‘ poee-poee ’ was carried on , and all culinary operations attended to .
melville	typee	thus much for the house , and its appurtenances ; and it will be readily acknowledged that a more commodious and appropriate dwelling for the climate and the people could not possibly be devised . it was cool , free to admit the air , scrupulously clean , and elevated above the dampness and impurities of the ground .
melville	typee	but now to sketch the inmates ; and here i claim for my tried servitor and faithful valet kory-kory the precedence of a first description . as his character will be gradually unfolded in the course of my narrative , i shall for the present content myself with delineating his personal appearance . kory-kory , though the most devoted and best natured serving-man in the world , was , alas ! a hideous object to look upon . he was some twenty-five years of age , and about six feet in height , robust and well made , and of the most extraordinary aspect . his head was carefully shaven with the exception of two circular spots , about the size of a dollar , near the top of the cranium , where the hair , permitted to grow of an amazing length , was twisted up in two prominent knots , that gave him the appearance of being decorated with a pair of horns . his beard , plucked out by the root from every other part of his face , was suffered to droop in hairy pendants , two of which garnished his under lip , and an equal number hung from the extremity of his chin .
melville	typee	kory-kory , with a view of improving the handiwork of nature , and perhaps prompted by a desire to add to the engaging expression of his countenance , had seen fit to embellish his face with three broad longitudinal stripes of tattooing , which , like those country roads that go straight forward in defiance of all obstacles , crossed his nasal organ , descended into the hollow of his eyes , and even skirted the borders of his mouth . each completely spanned his physiognomy ; one extending in a line with his eyes , another crossing the face in the vicinity of the nose , and the third sweeping along his lips from ear to ear . his countenance thus triply hooped , as it were , with tattooing , always reminded me of those unhappy wretches whom i have sometimes observed gazing out sentimentally from behind the grated bars of a prison window ; whilst the entire body of my savage valet , covered all over with representations of birds and fishes , and a variety of most unaccountable-looking creatures , suggested to me the idea of a pictorial museum of natural history , or an illustrated copy of ‘ goldsmith ’ s animated nature . ’
melville	typee	but it seems really heartless in me to write thus of the poor islander , when i owe perhaps to his unremitting attentions the very existence i now enjoy . kory-kory , i mean thee no harm in what i say in regard to thy outward adornings ; but they were a little curious to my unaccustomed sight , and therefore i dilate upon them . but to underrate or forget thy faithful services is something i could never be guilty of , even in the giddiest moment of my life .
melville	typee	the father of my attached follower was a native of gigantic frame , and had once possessed prodigious physical powers ; but the lofty form was now yielding to the inroads of time , though the hand of disease seemed never to have been laid upon the aged warrior . marheyo -- for such was his name -- appeared to have retired from all active participation in the affairs of the valley , seldom or never accompanying the natives in their various expeditions ; and employing the greater part of his time in throwing up a little shed just outside the house , upon which he was engaged to my certain knowledge for four months , without appearing to make any sensible advance . i suppose the old gentleman was in his dotage , for he manifested in various ways the characteristics which mark this particular stage of life .
melville	typee	i remember in particular his having a choice pair of ear-ornaments , fabricated from the teeth of some sea-monster . these he would alternately wear and take off at least fifty times in the course of the day , going and coming from his little hut on each occasion with all the tranquillity imaginable . sometimes slipping them through the slits in his ears , he would seize his spear -- which in length and slightness resembled a fishing-pole -- and go stalking beneath the shadows of the neighbouring groves , as if about to give a hostile meeting to some cannibal knight . but he would soon return again , and hiding his weapon under the projecting eaves of the house , and rolling his clumsy trinkets carefully in a piece of tappa , would resume his more pacific operations as quietly as if he had never interrupted them .
melville	typee	but despite his eccentricities , marheyo was a most paternal and warm-hearted old fellow , and in this particular not a little resembled his son kory-kory . the mother of the latter was the mistress of the family , and a notable housewife , and a most industrious old lady she was . if she did not understand the art of making jellies , jams , custard , tea-cakes , and such like trashy affairs , she was profoundly skilled in the mysteries of preparing ‘ amar ’ , ‘ poee-poee ’ , and ‘ kokoo ’ , with other substantial matters .
melville	typee	she was a genuine busy-body ; bustling about the house like a country landlady at an unexpected arrival ; for ever giving the young girls tasks to perform , which the little hussies as often neglected ; poking into every corner , and rummaging over bundles of old tappa , or making a prodigious clatter among the calabashes . sometimes she might have been seen squatting upon her haunches in front of a huge wooden basin , and kneading poee-poee with terrific vehemence , dashing the stone pestle about as if she would shiver the vessel into fragments ; on other occasions , galloping about the valley in search of a particular kind of leaf , used in some of her recondite operations , and returning home , toiling and sweating , with a bundle of it , under which most women would have sunk .
melville	typee	to tell the truth , kory-kory ’ s mother was the only industrious person in all the valley of typee ; and she could not have employed herself more actively had she been left an exceedingly muscular and destitute widow , with an inordinate ate supply of young children , in the bleakest part of the civilized world . there was not the slightest necessity for the greater portion of the labour performed by the old lady : but she seemed to work from some irresistible impulse ; her limbs continually swaying to and fro , as if there were some indefatigable engine concealed within her body which kept her in perpetual motion .
melville	typee	never suppose that she was a termagant or a shrew for all this ; she had the kindliest heart in the world , and acted towards me in particular in a truly maternal manner , occasionally putting some little morsel of choice food into my hand , some outlandish kind of savage sweetmeat or pastry , like a doting mother petting a sickly urchin with tarts and sugar plums . warm indeed are my remembrances of the dear , good , affectionate old tinor !
melville	typee	besides the individuals i have mentioned , there belonged to the household three young men , dissipated , good-for-nothing , roystering blades of savages , who were either employed in prosecuting love affairs with the maidens of the tribe , or grew boozy on ‘ arva ’ and tobacco in the company of congenial spirits , the scapegraces of the valley .
melville	typee	among the permanent inmates of the house were likewise several lovely damsels , who instead of thrumming pianos and reading novels , like more enlightened young ladies , substituted for these employments the manufacture of a fine species of tappa ; but for the greater portion of the time were skipping from house to house , gadding and gossiping with their acquaintances .
melville	typee	from the rest of these , however , i must except the beauteous nymph fayaway , who was my peculiar favourite . her free pliant figure was the very perfection of female grace and beauty . her complexion was a rich and mantling olive , and when watching the glow upon her cheeks i could almost swear that beneath the transparent medium there lurked the blushes of a faint vermilion .
melville	typee	the face of this girl was a rounded oval , and each feature as perfectly formed as the heart or imagination of man could desire . her full lips , when parted with a smile , disclosed teeth of dazzling whiteness and when her rosy mouth opened with a burst of merriment , they looked like the milk-white seeds of the ‘ arta , ’ a fruit of the valley , which , when cleft in twain , shows them reposing in rows on each side , imbedded in the red and juicy pulp . her hair of the deepest brown , parted irregularly in the middle , flowed in natural ringlets over her shoulders , and whenever she chanced to stoop , fell over and hid from view her lovely bosom . gazing into the depths of her strange blue eyes , when she was in a contemplative mood , they seemed most placid yet unfathomable ; but when illuminated by some lively emotion , they beamed upon the beholder like stars . the hands of fayaway were as soft and delicate as those of any countess ; for an entire exemption from rude labour marks the girlhood and even prime of a typee woman ’ s life . her feet , though wholly exposed , were as diminutive and fairly shaped as those which peep from beneath the skirts of a lima lady ’ s dress . the skin of this young creature , from continual ablutions and the use of mollifying ointments , was inconceivably smooth and soft .
melville	typee	i may succeed , perhaps , in particularizing some of the individual features of fayaway ’ s beauty , but that general loveliness of appearance which they all contributed to produce i will not attempt to describe . the easy unstudied graces of a child of nature like this , breathing from infancy an atmosphere of perpetual summer , and nurtured by the simple fruits of the earth ; enjoying a perfect freedom from care and anxiety , and removed effectually from all injurious tendencies , strike the eye in a manner which can not be pourtrayed . this picture is no fancy sketch ; it is drawn from the most vivid recollections of the person delineated .
melville	typee	were i asked if the beauteous form of fayaway was altogether free from the hideous blemish of tattooing , i should be constrained to answer that it was not . but the practitioners of the barbarous art , so remorseless in their inflictions upon the brawny limbs of the warriors of the tribe , seem to be conscious that it needs not the resources of their profession to augment the charms of the maidens of the vale .
melville	typee	the females are very little embellished in this way , and fayaway , and all the other young girls of her age , were even less so than those of their sex more advanced in years . the reason of this peculiarity will be alluded to hereafter . all the tattooing that the nymph in question exhibited upon her person may be easily described . three minute dots , no bigger than pin-heads , decorated each lip , and at a little distance were not at all discernible . just upon the fall of the shoulder were drawn two parallel lines half an inch apart , and perhaps three inches in length , the interval being filled with delicately executed figures . these narrow bands of tattooing , thus placed , always reminded me of those stripes of gold lace worn by officers in undress , and which are in lieu of epaulettes to denote their rank .
melville	typee	thus much was fayaway tattooed . the audacious hand which had gone so far in its desecrating work stopping short , apparently wanting the heart to proceed . but i have omitted to describe the dress worn by this nymph of the valley .
melville	typee	fayaway -- i must avow the fact -- for the most part clung to the primitive and summer garb of eden . but how becoming the costume ! it showed her fine figure to the best possible advantage ; and nothing could have been better adapted to her peculiar style of beauty . on ordinary occasions she was habited precisely as i have described the two youthful savages whom we had met on first entering the valley . at other times , when rambling among the groves , or visiting at the houses of her acquaintances , she wore a tunic of white tappa , reaching from her waist to a little below the knees ; and when exposed for any length of time to the sun , she invariably protected herself from its rays by a floating mantle of -- the same material , loosely gathered about the person . her gala dress will be described hereafter .
melville	typee	as the beauties of our own land delight in bedecking themselves with fanciful articles of jewellery , suspending them from their ears , hanging them about their necks , and clasping them around their wrists ; so fayaway and her companions were in the habit of ornamenting themselves with similar appendages .
melville	typee	flora was their jeweller . sometimes they wore necklaces of small carnation flowers , strung like rubies upon a fibre of tappa , or displayed in their ears a single white bud , the stem thrust backward through the aperture , and showing in front the delicate petals folded together in a beautiful sphere , and looking like a drop of the purest pearl . chaplets too , resembling in their arrangement the strawberry coronal worn by an english peeress , and composed of intertwined leaves and blossoms , often crowned their temples ; and bracelets and anklets of the same tasteful pattern were frequently to be seen . indeed , the maidens of the island were passionately fond of flowers , and never wearied of decorating their persons with them ; a lovely trait in their character , and one that ere long will be more fully alluded to .
melville	typee	though in my eyes , at least , fayaway was indisputably the loveliest female i saw in typee , yet the description i have given of her will in some measure apply to nearly all the youthful portion of her sex in the valley . judge ye then , reader , what beautiful creatures they must have been .
melville	typee	chapter twelve officiousness of kory-kory -- his devotion -- a bath in the stream -- want of refinement of the typee damsels -- stroll with mehevi -- a typee highway -- the taboo groves -- the hoolah hoolah ground -- the ti -- timeworn savages -- hospitality of mehevi -- midnight musings -- adventures in the dark -- distinguished honours paid to the visitors -- strange procession and return to the house of marheyo
melville	typee	when mehevi had departed from the house , as related in the preceding chapter , kory-kory commenced the functions of the post assigned him . he brought out , various kinds of food ; and , as if i were an infant , insisted upon feeding me with his own hands . to this procedure i , of course , most earnestly objected , but in vain ; and having laid a calabash of kokoo before me , he washed his fingers in a vessel of water , and then putting his hands into the dish and rolling the food into little balls , put them one after another into my mouth . all my remonstrances against this measure only provoked so great a clamour on his part , that i was obliged to acquiesce ; and the operation of feeding being thus facilitated , the meal was quickly despatched . as for toby , he was allowed to help himself after his own fashion .
melville	typee	the repast over , my attendant arranged the mats for repose , and , bidding me lie down , covered me with a large robe of tappa , at the same time looking approvingly upon me , and exclaiming ‘ ki-ki , nuee nuee , ah ! moee moee motarkee ’ ( eat plenty , ah ! sleep very good ) . the philosophy of this sentiment i did not pretend to question ; for deprived of sleep for several preceding nights , and the pain of my limb having much abated , i now felt inclined to avail myself of the opportunity afforded me .
melville	typee	the next morning , on waking , i found kory-kory stretched out on one side of me , while my companion lay upon the other . i felt sensibly refreshed after a night of sound repose , and immediately agreed to the proposition of my valet that i should repair to the water and wash , although dreading the suffering that the exertion might produce . from this apprehension , however , i was quickly relieved ; for kory-kory , leaping from the pi-pi , and then backing himself up against it , like a porter in readiness to shoulder a trunk , with loud vociferations and a superabundance of gestures , gave me to understand that i was to mount upon his back and be thus transported to the stream , which flowed perhaps two hundred yards from the house .
melville	typee	our appearance upon the verandah in front of the habitation drew together quite a crowd , who stood looking on and conversing with one another in the most animated manner . they reminded one of a group of idlers gathered about the door of a village tavern when the equipage of some distinguished traveller is brought round previously to his departure . as soon as i clasped my arms about the neck of the devoted fellow , and he jogged off with me , the crowd -- composed chiefly of young girls and boys -- followed after , shouting and capering with infinite glee , and accompanied us to the banks of the stream .
melville	typee	on gaining it , kory-kory , wading up to his hips in the water , carried me half way across , and deposited me on a smooth black stone which rose a few inches above the surface . the amphibious rabble at our heels plunged in after us , and climbing to the summit of the grass-grown rocks with which the bed of the brook was here and there broken , waited curiously to witness our morning ablutions .
melville	typee	somewhat embarrassed by the presence of the female portion of the company , and feeling my cheeks burning with bashful timidity , i formed a primitive basin by joining my hands together , and cooled my blushes in the water it contained ; then removing my frock , bent over and washed myself down to my waist in the stream . as soon as kory-kory comprehended from my motions that this was to be the extent of my performance , he appeared perfectly aghast with astonishment , and rushing towards me , poured out a torrent of words in eager deprecation of so limited an operation , enjoining me by unmistakable signs to immerse my whole body . to this i was forced to consent ; and the honest fellow regarding me as a froward , inexperienced child , whom it was his duty to serve at the risk of offending , lifted me from the rocks , and tenderly bathed my limbs . this over , and resuming my seat , i could not avoid bursting into admiration of the scene around me .
melville	typee	from the verdant surfaces of the large stones that lay scattered about , the natives were now sliding off into the water , diving and ducking beneath the surface in all directions -- the young girls springing buoyantly into the air , and revealing their naked forms to the waist , with their long tresses dancing about their shoulders , their eyes sparkling like drops of dew in the sun , and their gay laughter pealing forth at every frolicsome incident . on the afternoon of the day that i took my first bath in the valley , we received another visit from mehevi . the noble savage seemed to be in the same pleasant mood , and was quite as cordial in his manner as before . after remaining about an hour , he rose from the mats , and motioning to leave the house , invited toby and myself to accompany him . i pointed to my leg ; but mehevi in his turn pointed to kory-kory , and removed that objection ; so , mounting upon the faithful fellow ’ s shoulders again -- like the old man of the sea astride of sindbad -- i followed after the chief .
melville	typee	the nature of the route we now pursued struck me more forcibly than anything i had yet seen , as illustrating the indolent disposition of the islanders . the path was obviously the most beaten one in the valley , several others leading from each side into it , and perhaps for successive generations it had formed the principal avenue of the place . and yet , until i grew more familiar with its impediments , it seemed as difficult to travel as the recesses of a wilderness . part of it swept around an abrupt rise of ground , the surface of which was broken by frequent inequalities , and thickly strewn with projecting masses of rocks , whose summits were often hidden from view by the drooping foliage of the luxurious vegetation . sometimes directly over , sometimes evading these obstacles with a wide circuit , the path wound along ; -- one moment climbing over a sudden eminence smooth with continued wear , then descending on the other side into a steep glen , and crossing the flinty channel of a brook . here it pursued the depths of a glade , occasionally obliging you to stoop beneath vast horizontal branches ; and now you stepped over huge trunks and boughs that lay rotting across the track .
melville	typee	such was the grand thoroughfare of typee . after proceeding a little distance along it -- kory-kory panting and blowing with the weight of his burden -- i dismounted from his back , and grasping the long spear of mehevi in my hand , assisted my steps over the numerous obstacles of the road ; preferring this mode of advance to one which , from the difficulties of the way , was equally painful to myself and my wearied servitor .
melville	typee	our journey was soon at an end ; for , scaling a sudden height , we came abruptly upon the place of our destination . i wish that it were possible to sketch in words this spot as vividly as i recollect it .
melville	typee	here were situated the taboo groves of the valley -- the scene of many a prolonged feast , of many a horrid rite . beneath the dark shadows of the consecrated bread-fruit trees there reigned a solemn twilight -- a cathedral-like gloom . the frightful genius of pagan worship seemed to brood in silence over the place , breathing its spell upon every object around . here and there , in the depths of these awful shades , half screened from sight by masses of overhanging foliage , rose the idolatrous altars of the savages , built of enormous blocks of black and polished stone , placed one upon another , without cement , to the height of twelve or fifteen feet , and surmounted by a rustic open temple , enclosed with a low picket of canes , within which might be seen , in various stages of decay , offerings of bread-fruit and cocoanuts , and the putrefying relics of some recent sacrifice .
melville	typee	in the midst of the wood was the hallowed ‘ hoolah hoolah ’ ground -- set apart for the celebration of the fantastical religious ritual of these people -- comprising an extensive oblong pi-pi , terminating at either end in a lofty terraced altar , guarded by ranks of hideous wooden idols , and with the two remaining sides flanked by ranges of bamboo sheds , opening towards the interior of the quadrangle thus formed . vast trees , standing in the middle of this space , and throwing over it an umbrageous shade , had their massive trunks built round with slight stages , elevated a few feet above the ground , and railed in with canes , forming so many rustic pulpits , from which the priests harangued their devotees .
melville	typee	this holiest of spots was defended from profanation by the strictest edicts of the all-pervading ‘ taboo ’ , which condemned to instant death the sacrilegious female who should enter or touch its sacred precincts , or even so much as press with her feet the ground made holy by the shadows that it cast .
melville	typee	access was had to the enclosure through an embowered entrance , on one side , facing a number of towering cocoanut trees , planted at intervals along a level area of a hundred yards . at the further extremity of this space was to be seen a building of considerable size , reserved for the habitation of the priests and religious attendants of the groves .
melville	typee	in its vicinity was another remarkable edifice , built as usual upon the summit of a pi-pi , and at least two hundred feet in length , though not more than twenty in breadth . the whole front of this latter structure was completely open , and from one end to the other ran a narrow verandah , fenced in on the edge of the pi-pi with a picket of canes . its interior presented the appearance of an immense lounging place , the entire floor being strewn with successive layers of mats , lying between parallel trunks of cocoanut trees , selected for the purpose from the straightest and most symmetrical the vale afforded .
melville	typee	to this building , denominated in the language of the natives the ‘ ti ’ , mehevi now conducted us . thus far we had been accompanied by a troop of the natives of both sexes ; but as soon as we approached its vicinity , the females gradually separated themselves from the crowd , and standing aloof , permitted us to pass on . the merciless prohibitions of the taboo extended likewise to this edifice , and were enforced by the same dreadful penalty that secured the hoolah-hoolah ground from the imaginary pollution of a woman ’ s presence .
melville	typee	on entering the house , i was surprised to see six muskets ranged against the bamboo on one side , from the barrels of which depended as many small canvas pouches , partly filled with powder .
melville	typee	disposed about these muskets , like the cutlasses that decorate the bulkhead of a man-of-war ’ s cabin , were a great variety of rude spears and paddles , javelins , and war-clubs . this then , said i to toby , must be the armoury of the tribe .
melville	typee	as we advanced further along the building , we were struck with the aspect of four or five hideous old wretches , on whose decrepit forms time and tattooing seemed to have obliterated every trace of humanity . owing to the continued operation of this latter process , which only terminates among the warriors of the island after all the figures stretched upon their limbs in youth have been blended together -- an effect , however , produced only in cases of extreme longevity -- the bodies of these men were of a uniform dull green colour -- the hue which the tattooing gradually assumes as the individual advances in age . their skin had a frightful scaly appearance , which , united with its singular colour , made their limbs not a little resemble dusty specimens of verde-antique . their flesh , in parts , hung upon them in huge folds , like the overlapping plaits on the flank of a rhinoceros . their heads were completely bald , whilst their faces were puckered into a thousand wrinkles , and they presented no vestige of a beard . but the most remarkable peculiarity about them was the appearance of their feet ; the toes , like the radiating lines of the mariner ’ s compass , pointed to every quarter of the horizon . this was doubtless attributable to the fact , that during nearly a hundred years of existence the said toes never had been subjected to any artificial confinement , and in their old age , being averse to close neighbourhood , bid one another keep open order .
melville	typee	these repulsive-looking creatures appeared to have lost the use of their lower limbs altogether ; sitting upon the floor cross-legged in a state of torpor . they never heeded us in the least , scarcely looking conscious of our presence , while mehevi seated us upon the mats , and kory-kory gave utterance to some unintelligible gibberish .
melville	typee	in a few moments a boy entered with a wooden trencher of poee-poee ; and in regaling myself with its contents i was obliged again to submit to the officious intervention of my indefatigable servitor . various other dishes followed , the chief manifesting the most hospitable importunity in pressing us to partake , and to remove all bashfulness on our part , set us no despicable example in his own person .
melville	typee	the repast concluded , a pipe was lighted , which passed from mouth to mouth , and yielding to its soporific influence , the quiet of the place , and the deepening shadows of approaching night , my companion and i sank into a kind of drowsy repose , while the chief and kory-kory seemed to be slumbering beside us .
melville	typee	i awoke from an uneasy nap , about midnight , as i supposed ; and , raising myself partly from the mat , became sensible that we were enveloped in utter darkness . toby lay still asleep , but our late companions had disappeared . the only sound that interrupted the silence of the place was the asthmatic breathing of the old men i have mentioned , who reposed at a little distance from us . besides them , as well as i could judge , there was no one else in the house .
melville	typee	apprehensive of some evil , i roused my comrade , and we were engaged in a whispered conference concerning the unexpected withdrawal of the natives when all at once , from the depths of the grove , in full view of us where we lay , shoots of flame were seen to rise , and in a few moments illuminated the surrounding trees , casting , by contrast , into still deeper gloom the darkness around us .
melville	typee	while we continued gazing at this sight , dark figures appeared moving to and fro before the flames ; while others , dancing and capering about , looked like so many demons . regarding this new phenomenon with no small degree of trepidation , i said to my companion , ‘ what can all this mean , toby ? ’
melville	typee	‘ oh , nothing , ’ replied he ; ‘ getting the fire ready , i suppose. ’ ‘ fire ! ’ exclaimed i , while my heart took to beating like a trip-hammer , ‘ what fire ? ’ ‘ why , the fire to cook us , to be sure , what else would the cannibals be kicking up such a row about if it were not for that ? ’
melville	typee	‘ oh , toby ! have done with your jokes ; this is no time for them ; something is about to happen , i feel confident. ’ ‘ jokes , indeed ? ’ exclaimed toby indignantly . ‘ did you ever hear me joke ? why , for what do you suppose the devils have been feeding us up in this kind of style during the last three days , unless it were for something that you are too much frightened at to talk about ? look at that kory-kory there ! -- has he not been stuffing you with his confounded mushes , just in the way they treat swine before they kill them ? depend upon it , we will be eaten this blessed night , and there is the fire we shall be roasted by . ’
melville	typee	this view of the matter was not at all calculated to allay my apprehensions , and i shuddered when i reflected that we were indeed at the mercy of a tribe of cannibals , and that the dreadful contingency to which toby had alluded was by no means removed beyond the bounds of possibility .
melville	typee	‘ there ! i told you so ! they are coming for us ! ’ exclaimed my companion the next moment , as the forms of four of the islanders were seen in bold relief against the illuminated back-ground mounting the pi-pi and approaching towards us .
melville	typee	they came on noiselessly , nay stealthily , and glided along through the gloom that surrounded us as if about to spring upon some object they were fearful of disturbing before they should make sure of it. -- gracious heaven ! the horrible reflections which crowded upon me that moment. -- a cold sweat stood upon my brow , and spell-bound with terror i awaited my fate !
melville	typee	suddenly the silence was broken by the well-remembered tones of mehevi , and at the kindly accents of his voice my fears were immediately dissipated . ‘ tommo , toby , ki ki ! ’ ( eat ) . he had waited to address us , until he had assured himself that we were both awake , at which he seemed somewhat surprised .
melville	typee	‘ ki ki ! is it ? ’ said toby in his gruff tones ; ‘ well , cook us first , will you -- but what ’ s this ? ’ he added , as another savage appeared , bearing before him a large trencher of wood containing some kind of steaming meat , as appeared from the odours it diffused , and which he deposited at the feet of mehevi . ‘ a baked baby , i dare say i but i will have none of it , never mind what it is. -- a pretty fool i should make of myself , indeed , waked up here in the middle of the night , stuffing and guzzling , and all to make a fat meal for a parcel of booby-minded cannibals one of these mornings ! -- no , i see what they are at very plainly , so i am resolved to starve myself into a bunch of bones and gristle , and then , if they serve me up , they are welcome ! but i say , tommo , you are not going to eat any of that mess there , in the dark , are you ? why , how can you tell what it is ? ’
melville	typee	‘ by tasting it , to be sure , ’ said i , masticating a morsel that kory-kory had just put in my mouth , ‘ and excellently good it is , too , very much like veal. ’ ‘ a baked baby , by the soul of captain cook ! ’ burst forth toby , with amazing vehemence ; ‘ veal ? why there never was a calf on the island till you landed . i tell you you are bolting down mouthfuls from a dead happar ’ s carcass , as sure as you live , and no mistake ! ’
melville	typee	emetics and lukewarm water ! what a sensation in the abdominal region ! sure enough , where could the fiends incarnate have obtained meat ? but i resolved to satisfy myself at all hazards ; and turning to mehevi , i soon made the ready chief understand that i wished a light to be brought . when the taper came , i gazed eagerly into the vessel , and recognized the mutilated remains of a juvenile porker ! ‘ puarkee ! ’ exclaimed kory-kory , looking complacently at the dish ; and from that day to this i have never forgotten that such is the designation of a pig in the typee lingo .
melville	typee	the next morning , after being again abundantly feasted by the hospitable mehevi , toby and myself arose to depart . but the chief requested us to postpone our intention . ‘ abo , abo ’ ( wait , wait ) , he said and accordingly we resumed our seats , while , assisted by the zealous kory-kory , he appeared to be engaged in giving directions to a number of the natives outside , who were busily employed in making arrangements , the nature of which we could not comprehend . but we were not left long in our ignorance , for a few moments only had elapsed , when the chief beckoned us to approach , and we perceived that he had been marshalling a kind of guard of honour to escort us on our return to the house of marheyo .
melville	typee	the procession was led off by two venerable-looking savages , each provided with a spear , from the end of which streamed a pennon of milk-white tappa . after them went several youths , bearing aloft calabashes of poee-poee , and followed in their turn by four stalwart fellows , sustaining long bamboos , from the tops of which hung suspended , at least twenty feet from the ground , large baskets of green bread-fruits . then came a troop of boys , carrying bunches of ripe bananas , and baskets made of the woven leaflets of cocoanut boughs , filled with the young fruit of the tree , the naked shells stripped of their husks peeping forth from the verdant wicker-work that surrounded them . last of all came a burly islander , holding over his head a wooden trencher , in which lay disposed the remnants of our midnight feast , hidden from view , however , by a covering of bread-fruit leaves .
melville	typee	astonished as i was at this exhibition , i could not avoid smiling at its grotesque appearance , and the associations it naturally called up . mehevi , it seemed , was bent on replenishing old marheyo ’ s larder , fearful perhaps that without this precaution his guests might not fare as well as they could desire .
melville	typee	as soon as i descended from the pi-pi , the procession formed anew , enclosing us in its centre ; where i remained part of the time , carried by kory-kory , and occasionally relieving him from his burden by limping along with spear . when we moved off in this order , the natives struck up a musical recitative , which with various alternations , they continued until we arrived at the place of our destination .
melville	typee	as we proceeded on our way , bands of young girls , darting from the surrounding groves , hung upon our skirts , and accompanied us with shouts of merriment and delight , which almost drowned the deep notes of the recitative . on approaching old marheyo ’ s domicile , its inmates rushed out to receive us ; and while the gifts of mehevi were being disposed of , the superannuated warrior did the honours of his mansion with all the warmth of hospitality evinced by an english squire when he regales his friends at some fine old patrimonial mansion .
melville	typee	chapter thirteen attempt to procure relief from nukuheva -- perilous adventure of toby in the happar mountains -- eloquence of kory-kory amidst these novel scenes a week passed away almost imperceptibly . the natives , actuated by some mysterious impulse , day after day redoubled their attentions to us . their manner towards us was unaccountable . surely , thought i , they would not act thus if they meant us any harm . but why this excess of deferential kindness , or what equivalent can they imagine us capable of rendering them for it ?
melville	typee	we were fairly puzzled . but despite the apprehensions i could not dispel , the horrible character imputed to these typees appeared to be wholly undeserved . ‘ why , they are cannibals ! ’ said toby on one occasion when i eulogized the tribe . ‘ granted , ’ i replied , ‘ but a more humane , gentlemanly and amiable set of epicures do not probably exist in the pacific . ’
melville	typee	but , notwithstanding the kind treatment we received , i was too familiar with the fickle disposition of savages not to feel anxious to withdraw from the valley , and put myself beyond the reach of that fearful death which , under all these smiling appearances , might yet menace us . but here there was an obstacle in the way of doing so . it was idle for me to think of moving from the place until i should have recovered from the severe lameness that afflicted me ; indeed my malady began seriously to alarm me ; for , despite the herbal remedies of the natives , it continued to grow worse and worse . their mild applications , though they soothed the pain , did not remove the disorder , and i felt convinced that without better aid i might anticipate long and acute suffering .
melville	typee	but how was this aid to be procured ? from the surgeons of the french fleet , which probably still lay in the bay of nukuheva , it might easily have been obtained , could i have made my case known to them . but how could that be effected ?
melville	typee	at last , in the exigency to which i was reduced , i proposed to toby that he should endeavour to go round to nukuheva , and if he could not succeed in returning to the valley by water , in one of the boats of the squadron , and taking me off , he might at least procure me some proper medicines , and effect his return overland .
melville	typee	my companion listened to me in silence , and at first did not appear to relish the idea . the truth was , he felt impatient to escape from the place , and wished to avail himself of our present high favour with the natives to make good our retreat , before we should experience some sudden alteration in their behaviour . as he could not think of leaving me in my helpless condition , he implored me to be of good cheer ; assured me that i should soon be better , and enabled in a few days to return with him to nukuheva .
melville	typee	added to this , he could not bear the idea of again returning to this dangerous place ; and as for the expectation of persuading the frenchmen to detach a boat ’ s crew for the purpose of rescuing me from the typees , he looked upon it as idle ; and with arguments that i could not answer , urged the improbability of their provoking the hostilities of the clan by any such measure ; especially , as for the purpose of quieting its apprehensions , they had as yet refrained from making any visit to the bay . ‘ and even should they consent , ’ said toby , ‘ they would only produce a commotion in the valley , in which we might both be sacrificed by these ferocious islanders. ’ this was unanswerable ; but still i clung to the belief that he might succeed in accomplishing the other part of my plan ; and at last i overcame his scruples , and he agreed to make the attempt .
melville	typee	as soon as we succeeded in making the natives understand our intention , they broke out into the most vehement opposition to the measure , and for a while i almost despaired of obtaining their consent . at the bare thought of one of us leaving them , they manifested the most lively concern . the grief and consternation of kory-kory , in particular , was unbounded ; he threw himself into a perfect paroxysm of gestures which were intended to convey to us not only his abhorrence of nukuheva and its uncivilized inhabitants , but also his astonishment that after becoming acquainted with the enlightened typees , we should evince the least desire to withdraw , even for a time , from their agreeable society .
melville	typee	however , i overbore his objections by appealing to my lameness ; from which i assured the natives i should speedily recover if toby were permitted to obtain the supplies i needed .
melville	typee	it was agreed that on the following morning my companion should depart , accompanied by some one or two of the household , who should point out to him an easy route , by which the bay might be reached before sunset .
melville	typee	at early dawn of the next day , our habitation was astir . one of the young men mounted into an adjoining cocoanut tree , and threw down a number of the young fruit , which old marheyo quickly stripped of the green husks , and strung together upon a short pole . these were intended to refresh toby on his route .
melville	typee	the preparations being completed , with no little emotion i bade my companion adieu . he promised to return in three days at farthest ; and , bidding me keep up my spirits in the interval , turned round the corner of the pi-pi , and , under the guidance of the venerable marheyo , was soon out of sight . his departure oppressed me with melancholy , and , re-entering the dwelling , i threw myself almost in despair upon the matting of the floor .
melville	typee	in two hours ’ time the old warrior returned , and gave me to understand that after accompanying my companion a little distance , and showing him the route , he had left him journeying on his way .
melville	typee	it was about noon of this same day , a season which these people are wont to pass in sleep , that i lay in the house , surrounded by its slumbering inmates , and painfully affected by the strange silence which prevailed . all at once i thought i heard a faint shout , as if proceeding from some persons in the depth of the grove which extended in front of our habitation .
melville	typee	the sounds grew louder and nearer , and gradually the whole valley rang with wild outcries . the sleepers around me started to their feet in alarm , and hurried outside to discover the cause of the commotion . kory-kory , who had been the first to spring up , soon returned almost breathless , and nearly frantic with the excitement under which he seemed to be labouring . all that i could understand from him was that some accident had happened to toby . apprehensive of some dreadful calamity , i rushed out of the house , and caught sight of a tumultuous crowd , who , with shrieks and lamentations , were just emerging from the grove bearing in their arms some object , the sight of which produced all this transport of sorrow . as they drew near , the men redoubled their cries , while the girls , tossing their bare arms in the air , exclaimed plaintively , ‘ awha ! awha ! toby mukee moee ! ’ -- alas ! alas ! toby is killed !
melville	typee	in a moment the crowd opened , and disclosed the apparently lifeless body of my companion home between two men , the head hanging heavily against the breast of the foremost . the whole face , neck , back , and bosom were covered with blood , which still trickled slowly from a wound behind the temple . in the midst of the greatest uproar and confusion the body was carried into the house and laid on a mat . waving the natives off to give room and air , i bent eagerly over toby , and , laying my hand upon the breast , ascertained that the heart still beat . overjoyed at this , i seized a calabash of water , and dashed its contents upon his face , then wiping away the blood , anxiously examined the wound . it was about three inches long , and on removing the clotted hair from about it , showed the skull laid completely bare . immediately with my knife i cut away the heavy locks , and bathed the part repeatedly in water .
melville	typee	in a few moments toby revived , and opening his eyes for a second -- closed them again without speaking . kory-kory , who had been kneeling beside me , now chafed his limbs gently with the palms of his hands , while a young girl at his head kept fanning him , and i still continued to moisten his lips and brow . soon my poor comrade showed signs of animation , and i succeeded in making him swallow from a cocoanut shell a few mouthfuls of water .
melville	typee	old tinor now appeared , holding in her hand some simples she had gathered , the juice of which she by signs besought me to squeeze into the wound . having done so , i thought it best to leave toby undisturbed until he should have had time to rally his faculties . several times he opened his lips , but fearful for his safety i enjoined silence . in the course of two or three hours , however , he sat up , and was sufficiently recovered to tell me what had occurred .
melville	typee	‘ after leaving the house with marheyo , ’ said toby , ‘ we struck across the valley , and ascended the opposite heights . just beyond them , my guide informed me , lay the valley of happar , while along their summits , and skirting the head of the vale , was my route to nukuheva . after mounting a little way up the elevation my guide paused , and gave me to understand that he could not accompany me any farther , and by various signs intimated that he was afraid to approach any nearer the territories of the enemies of his tribe . he however pointed out my path , which now lay clearly before me , and bidding me farewell , hastily descended the mountain .
melville	typee	‘ quite elated at being so near the happars , i pushed up the acclivity , and soon gained its summit . it tapered to a sharp ridge , from whence i beheld both the hostile valleys . here i sat down and rested for a moment , refreshing myself with my cocoanuts . i was soon again pursuing my way along the height , when suddenly i saw three of the islanders , who must have just come out of happar valley , standing in the path ahead of me . they were each armed with a heavy spear , and one from his appearance i took to be a chief . they sung out something , i could not understand what , and beckoned me to come on .
melville	typee	‘ without the least hesitation i advanced towards them , and had approached within about a yard of the foremost , when , pointing angrily into the typee valley , and uttering some savage exclamation , he wheeled round his weapon like lightning , and struck me in a moment to the ground . the blow inflicted this wound , and took away my senses . as soon as i came to myself , i perceived the three islanders standing a little distance off , and apparently engaged in some violent altercation respecting me .
melville	typee	‘ my first impulse was to run for it ; but , in endeavouring to rise , i fell back , and rolled down a little grassy precipice . the shock seemed to rally my faculties ; so , starting to my feet , i fled down the path i had just ascended . i had no need to look behind me , for , from the yells i heard , i knew that my enemies were in full pursuit . urged on by their fearful outcries , and heedless of the injury i had received -- though the blood flowing from the wound trickled over into my eyes and almost blinded me -- i rushed down the mountain side with the speed of the wind . in a short time i had descended nearly a third of the distance , and the savages had ceased their cries , when suddenly a terrific howl burst upon my ear , and at the same moment a heavy javelin darted past me as i fled , and stuck quivering in a tree close to me . another yell followed , and a second spear and a third shot through the air within a few feet of my body , both of them piercing the ground obliquely in advance of me . the fellows gave a roar of rage and disappointment ; but they were afraid , i suppose , of coming down further into the typee valley , and so abandoned the chase . i saw them recover their weapons and turn back ; and i continued my descent as fast as i could .
melville	typee	‘ what could have caused this ferocious attack on the part of these happars i could not imagine , unless it were that they had seen me ascending the mountain with marheyo , and that the mere fact of coming from the typee valley was sufficient to provoke them .
melville	typee	‘ as long as i was in danger i scarcely felt the wound i had received ; but when the chase was over i began to suffer from it . i had lost my hat in the flight , and the run scorched my bare head . i felt faint and giddy ; but , fearful of falling to the ground beyond the reach of assistance , i staggered on as well as i could , and at last gained the level of the valley , and then down i sank ; and i knew nothing more until i found myself lying upon these mats , and you stooping over me with the calabash of water . ’
melville	typee	such was toby ’ s account of this sad affair . i afterwards learned that , fortunately , he had fallen close to a spot where the natives go for fuel . a party of them caught sight of him as he fell , and sounding the alarm , had lifted him up ; and after ineffectually endeavouring to restore him at the brook , had hurried forward with him to the house .
melville	typee	this incident threw a dark cloud over our prospects . it reminded us that we were hemmed in by hostile tribes , whose territories we could not hope to pass , on our route to nukuheva , without encountering the effects of their savage resentment . there appeared to be no avenue opened to our escape but the sea , which washed the lower extremities of the vale .
melville	typee	our typee friends availed themselves of the recent disaster of toby to exhort us to a due appreciation of the blessings we enjoyed among them , contrasting their own generous reception of us with the animosity of their neighbours . they likewise dwelt upon the cannibal propensities of the happars , a subject which they were perfectly aware could not fail to alarm us ; while at the same time they earnestly disclaimed all participation in so horrid a custom . nor did they omit to call upon us to admire the natural loveliness of their own abode , and the lavish abundance with which it produced all manner of luxuriant fruits ; exalting it in this particular above any of the surrounding valleys .
melville	typee	kory-kory seemed to experience so heartfelt a desire to infuse into our minds proper views on these subjects , that , assisted in his endeavours by the little knowledge of the language we had acquired , he actually made us comprehend a considerable part of what he said . to facilitate our correct apprehension of his meaning , he at first condensed his ideas into the smallest possible compass .
melville	typee	‘ happar keekeeno nuee , ’ he exclaimed , ‘ nuee , nuee , ki ki kannaka ! -- ah ! owle motarkee ! ’ which signifies , ‘ terrible fellows those happars ! -- devour an amazing quantity of men ! -- ah , shocking bad ! ’ thus far he explained himself by a variety of gestures , during the performance of which he would dart out of the house , and point abhorrently towards the happar valley ; running in to us again with a rapidity that showed he was fearful he would lose one part of his meaning before he could complete the other ; and continuing his illustrations by seizing the fleshy part of my arm in his teeth , intimating by the operation that the people who lived over in that direction would like nothing better than to treat me in that manner .
melville	typee	having assured himself that we were fully enlightened on this point , he proceeded to another branch of his subject . ‘ ah ! typee mortakee ! -- nuee , nuee mioree -- nuee , nuee wai -- nuee , nuee poee-poee -- nuee , nuee kokoo -- ah ! nuee , nuee kiki -- ah ! nuee , nuee , nuee ! ’ which literally interpreted as before , would imply , ‘ ah , typee ! isn ’ t it a fine place though ! -- no danger of starving here , i tell you ! -- plenty of bread-fruit -- plenty of water -- plenty of pudding -- ah ! plenty of everything ! ah ! heaps , heaps heaps ! ’ all this was accompanied by a running commentary of signs and gestures which it was impossible not to comprehend .
melville	typee	as he continued his harangue , however , kory-kory , in emulation of our more polished orators , began to launch out rather diffusely into other branches of his subject , enlarging probably upon the moral reflections it suggested ; and proceeded in such a strain of unintelligible and stunning gibberish , that he actually gave me the headache for the rest of the day .
melville	typee	chapter fourteen a great event happens in the valley -- the island telegraph -- something befalls toby -- fayaway displays a tender heart -- melancholy reflections -- mysterious conduct of the islanders -- devotion of kory-kory -- a rural couch -- a luxury -- kory-kory strikes a light a la typee
melville	typee	in the course of a few days toby had recovered from the effects of his adventure with the happar warriors ; the wound on his head rapidly healing under the vegetable treatment of the good tinor . less fortunate than my companion however , i still continued to languish under a complaint , the origin and nature of which were still a mystery . cut off as i was from all intercourse with the civilized world , and feeling the inefficacy of anything the natives could do to relieve me ; knowing , too , that so long as i remained in my present condition , it would be impossible for me to leave the valley , whatever opportunity might present itself ; and apprehensive that ere long we might be exposed to some caprice on the part of the islanders , i now gave up all hopes of recovery , and became a prey to the most gloomy thoughts . a deep dejection fell upon me , which neither the friendly remonstrances of my companion , the devoted attentions of kory-kory nor all the soothing influences of fayaway could remove .
melville	typee	one morning as i lay on the mats in the house , plunged in melancholy reverie , and regardless of everything around me , toby , who had left me about an hour , returned in haste , and with great glee told me to cheer up and be of good heart ; for he believed , from what was going on among the natives , that there were boats approaching the bay .
melville	typee	these tidings operated upon me like magic . the hour of our deliverance was at hand , and starting up , i was soon convinced that something unusual was about to occur . the word ‘ botee ! botee ! ’ was vociferated in all directions ; and shouts were heard in the distance , at first feebly and faintly ; but growing louder and nearer at each successive repetition , until they were caught up by a fellow in a cocoanut tree a few yards off , who sounding them in turn , they were reiterated from a neighbouring grove , and so died away gradually from point to point , as the intelligence penetrated into the farthest recess of the valley . this was the vocal telegraph of the islanders ; by means of which condensed items of information could be carried in a very few minutes from the sea to their remotest habitation , a distance of at least eight or nine miles . on the present occasion it was in active operation ; one piece of information following another with inconceivable rapidity .
melville	typee	the greatest commotion now appeared to prevail . at every fresh item of intelligence the natives betrayed the liveliest interest , and redoubled the energy with which they employed themselves in collecting fruit to sell to the expected visitors . some were tearing off the husks from cocoanuts ; some perched in the trees were throwing down bread-fruit to their companions , who gathered them into heaps as they fell ; while others were plying their fingers rapidly in weaving leafen baskets in which to carry the fruit .
melville	typee	there were other matters too going on at the same time . here you would see a stout warrior polishing his spear with a bit of old tappa , or adjusting the folds of the girdle about his waist ; and there you might descry a young damsel decorating herself with flowers , as if having in her eye some maidenly conquest ; while , as in all cases of hurry and confusion in every part of the world , a number of individuals kept hurrying to and fro , with amazing vigour and perseverance , doing nothing themselves , and hindering others .
melville	typee	never before had we seen the islanders in such a state of bustle and excitement ; and the scene furnished abundant evidence of the fact -- that it was only at long intervals any such events occur .
melville	typee	when i thought of the length of time that might intervene before a similar chance of escape would be presented , i bitterly lamented that i had not the power of availing myself effectually of the present opportunity .
melville	typee	from all that we could gather , it appeared that the natives were fearful of arriving too late upon the beach , unless they made extraordinary exertions . sick and lame as i was , i would have started with toby at once , had not kory-kory not only refused to carry me , but manifested the most invincible repugnance to our leaving the neighbourhood of the house . the rest of the savages were equally opposed to our wishes , and seemed grieved and astonished at the earnestness of my solicitations . i clearly perceived that while my attendant avoided all appearance of constraining my movements , he was nevertheless determined to thwart my wishes . he seemed to me on this particular occasion , as well as often afterwards , to be executing the orders of some other person with regard to me , though at the same time feeling towards me the most lively affection .
melville	typee	toby , who had made up his mind to accompany the islanders if possible , as soon as they were in readiness to depart , and who for that reason had refrained from showing the same anxiety that i had done , now represented to me that it was idle for me to entertain the hope of reaching the beach in time to profit by any opportunity that might then be presented .
melville	typee	‘ do you not see , ’ said he , ‘ the savages themselves are fearful of being too late , and i should hurry forward myself at once did i not think that if i showed too much eagerness i should destroy all our hopes of reaping any benefit from this fortunate event . if you will only endeavour to appear tranquil or unconcerned , you will quiet their suspicions , and i have no doubt they will then let me go with them to the beach , supposing that i merely go out of curiosity . should i succeed in getting down to the boats , i will make known the condition in which i have left you , and measures may then be taken to secure our escape . ’
melville	typee	in the expediency of this i could not but acquiesce ; and as the natives had now completed their preparations , i watched with the liveliest interest the reception that toby ’ s application might meet with . as soon as they understood from my companion that i intended to remain , they appeared to make no objection to his proposition , and even hailed it with pleasure . their singular conduct on this occasion not a little puzzled me at the time , and imparted to subsequent events an additional mystery .
melville	typee	the islanders were now to be seen hurrying along the path which led to the sea . i shook toby warmly by the hand , and gave him my payta hat to shield his wounded head from the sun , as he had lost his own . he cordially returned the pressure of my hand , and solemnly promising to return as soon as the boats should leave the shore , sprang from my side , and the next minute disappeared in a turn of the grove .
melville	typee	in spite of the unpleasant reflections that crowded upon my mind , i could not but be entertained by the novel and animated sight which by now met my view . one after another the natives crowded along the narrow path , laden with every variety of fruit . here , you might have seen one , who , after ineffectually endeavouring to persuade a surly porker to be conducted in leading strings , was obliged at last to seize the perverse animal in his arms , and carry him struggling against his naked breast , and squealing without intermission . there went two , who at a little distance might have been taken for the hebrew spies , on their return to moses with the goodly bunch of grape . one trotted before the other at a distance of a couple of yards , while between them , from a pole resting on the shoulders , was suspended a huge cluster of bananas , which swayed to and fro with the rocking gait at which they proceeded . here ran another , perspiring with his exertions , and bearing before him a quantity of cocoanuts , who , fearful of being too late , heeded not the fruit that dropped from his basket , and appeared solely intent upon reaching his destination , careless how many of his cocoanuts kept company with him .
melville	typee	in a short time the last straggler was seen hurrying on his way , and the faint shouts of those in advance died insensibly upon the ear . our part of the valley now appeared nearly deserted by its inhabitants , kory-kory , his aged father , and a few decrepit old people , being all that were left .
melville	typee	towards sunset the islanders in small parties began to return from the beach , and among them , as they drew near to the house , i sought to descry the form of my companion . but one after another they passed the dwelling , and i caught no glimpse of him . supposing , however , that he would soon appear with some of the members of the household , i quieted my apprehensions , and waited patiently to see him advancing in company with the beautiful fayaway . at last , i perceived tinor coming forward , followed by the girls and young men who usually resided in the house of marheyo ; but with them came not my comrade , and , filled with a thousand alarms , i eagerly sought to discover the cause of his delay .
melville	typee	my earnest questions appeared to embarrass the natives greatly . all their accounts were contradictory : one giving me to understand that toby would be with me in a very short time ; another that he did not know where he was ; while a third , violently inveighing , against him , assured me that he had stolen away , and would never come back . it appeared to me , at the time , that in making these various statements they endeavoured to conceal from me some terrible disaster , lest the knowledge of it should overpower me .
melville	typee	fearful lest some fatal calamity had overtaken him , i sought out young fayaway , and endeavoured to learn from her , if possible , the truth . this gentle being had early attracted my regard , not only from her extraordinary beauty , but from the attractive cast of her countenance , singularly expressive of intelligence and humanity . of all the natives she alone seemed to appreciate the effect which the peculiarity of the circumstances in which we were placed had produced upon the minds of my companion and myself . in addressing me -- especially when i lay reclining upon the mats suffering from pain -- there was a tenderness in her manner which it was impossible to misunderstand or resist . whenever she entered the house , the expression of her face indicated the liveliest sympathy for me ; and moving towards the place where i lay , with one arm slightly elevated in a gesture of pity , and her large glistening eyes gazing intently into mine , she would murmur plaintively , ‘ awha ! awha ! tommo , ’ and seat herself mournfully beside me .
melville	typee	her manner convinced me that she deeply compassionated my situation , as being removed from my country and friends , and placed beyond the reach of all relief . indeed , at times i was almost led to believe that her mind was swayed by gentle impulses hardly to be anticipated from one in her condition ; that she appeared to be conscious there were ties rudely severed , which had once bound us to our homes ; that there were sisters and brothers anxiously looking forward to our return , who were , perhaps , never more to behold us .
melville	typee	in this amiable light did fayaway appear in my eyes ; and reposing full confidence in her candour and intelligence , i now had recourse to her , in the midst of my alarm , with regard to my companion .
melville	typee	my questions evidently distressed her . she looked round from one to another of the bystanders , as if hardly knowing what answer to give me . at last , yielding to my importunities , she overcame her scruples , and gave me to understand that toby had gone away with the boats which had visited the bay , but had promised to return at the expiration of three days . at first i accused him of perfidiously deserting me ; but as i grew more composed , i upbraided myself for imputing so cowardly an action to him , and tranquillized myself with the belief that he had availed himself , of the opportunity to go round to nukuheva , in order to make some arrangement by which i could be removed from the valley . at any rate , thought i , he will return with the medicines i require , and then , as soon as i recover , there will be no difficulty in the way of our departure .
melville	typee	consoling myself with these reflections , i lay down that night in a happier frame of mind than i had done for some time . the next day passed without any allusion to toby on the part of the natives , who seemed desirous of avoiding all reference to the subject . this raised some apprehensions in my breast ; but when night came , i congratulated myself that the second day had now gone by , and that on the morrow toby would again be with me . but the morrow came and went , and my companion did not appear . ah ! thought i , he reckons three days from the morning of his departure , -- tomorrow he will arrive . but that weary day also closed upon me , without his return . even yet i would not despair ; i thought that something detained him -- that he was waiting for the sailing of a boat , at nukuheva , and that in a day or two at farthest i should see him again . but day after day of renewed disappointment passed by ; at last hope deserted me , and i fell a victim to despair .
melville	typee	yes ; thought i , gloomily , he has secured his own escape , and cares not what calamity may befall his unfortunate comrade . fool that i was , to suppose that any one would willingly encounter the perils of this valley , after having once got beyond its limits ! he has gone , and has left me to combat alone all the dangers by which i am surrounded . thus would i sometimes seek to derive a desperate consolation from dwelling upon the perfidity of toby : whilst at other times i sunk under the bitter remorse which i felt as having by my own imprudence brought upon myself the fate which i was sure awaited me .
melville	typee	at other times i thought that perhaps after all these treacherous savages had made away with him , and thence the confusion into which they were thrown by my questions , and their contradictory answers , or he might be a captive in some other part of the valley , or , more dreadful still , might have met with that fate at which my very soul shuddered . but all these speculations were vain ; no tidings of toby ever reached me ; he had gone never to return .
melville	typee	the conduct of the islanders appeared inexplicable . all reference to my lost comrade was carefully evaded , and if at any time they were forced to make some reply to my frequent inquiries on the subject , they would uniformly denounce him as an ungrateful runaway , who had deserted his friend , and taken himself off to that vile and detestable place nukuheva .
melville	typee	but whatever might have been his fate , now that he was gone the natives multiplied their acts of kindness and attention towards myself , treating me with a degree of deference which could hardly have been surpassed had i been some celestial visitant . kory-kory never for one moment left my side , unless it were to execute my wishes . the faithful fellow , twice every day , in the cool of the morning and in the evening , insisted upon carrying me to the stream , and bathing me in its refreshing water .
melville	typee	frequently in the afternoon he would carry me to a particular part of the stream , where the beauty of the scene produced a soothing influence upon my mind . at this place the waters flowed between grassy banks , planted with enormous bread-fruit trees , whose vast branches interlacing overhead , formed a leafy canopy ; near the stream were several smooth black rocks . one of these , projecting several feet above the surface of the water , had upon its summit a shallow cavity , which , filled with freshly-gathered leaves , formed a delightful couch .
melville	typee	here i often lay for hours , covered with a gauze-like veil of tappa , while fayaway , seated beside me , and holding in her hand a fan woven from the leaflets of a young cocoanut bough , brushed aside the insects that occasionally lighted on my face , and kory-kory , with a view of chasing away my melancholy , performed a thousand antics in the water before us .
melville	typee	as my eye wandered along this romantic stream , it would fall upon the half-immersed figure of a beautiful girl , standing in the transparent water , and catching in a little net a species of diminutive shell-fish , of which these people are extraordinarily fond . sometimes a chattering group would be seated upon the edge of a low rock in the midst of the brook , busily engaged in thinning and polishing the shells of cocoanuts , by rubbing them briskly with a small stone in the water , an operation which soon converts them into a light and elegant drinking vessel , somewhat resembling goblets made of tortoise shell .
melville	typee	but the tranquillizing influence of beautiful scenery , and the exhibition of human life under so novel and charming an aspect were not my only sources of consolation . every evening the girls of the house gathered about me on the mats , and after chasing away kory-kory from my side -- who nevertheless , retired only to a little distance and watched their proceedings with the most jealous attention -- would anoint my whole body with a fragrant oil , squeezed from a yellow root , previously pounded between a couple of stones , and which in their language is denominated ‘ aka ’ . and most refreshing and agreeable are the juices of the ‘ aka ’ , when applied to ones , limbs by the soft palms of sweet nymphs , whose bright eyes are beaming upon you with kindness ; and i used to hail with delight the daily recurrence of this luxurious operation , in which i forgot all my troubles , and buried for the time every feeling of sorrow .
melville	typee	sometimes in the cool of the evening my devoted servitor would lead me out upon the pi-pi in front of the house , and seating me near its edge , protect my body from the annoyance of the insects which occasionally hovered in the air , by wrapping me round with a large roll of tappa . he then bustled about , and employed himself at least twenty minutes in adjusting everything to secure my personal comfort .
melville	typee	having perfected his arrangements , he would get my pipe , and , lighting it , would hand it to me . often he was obliged to strike a light for the occasion , and as the mode he adopted was entirely different from what i had ever seen or heard of before i will describe it .
melville	typee	a straight , dry , and partly decayed stick of the hibiscus , about six feet in length , and half as many inches in diameter , with a small , bit of wood not more than a foot long , and scarcely an inch wide , is as invariably to be met with in every house in typee as a box of lucifer matches in the corner of a kitchen cupboard at home .
melville	typee	the islander , placing the larger stick obliquely against some object , with one end elevated at an angle of forty-five degrees , mounts astride of it like an urchin about to gallop off upon a cane , and then grasping the smaller one firmly in both hands , he rubs its pointed end slowly up and down the extent of a few inches on the principal stick , until at last he makes a narrow groove in the wood , with an abrupt termination at the point furthest from him , where all the dusty particles which the friction creates are accumulated in a little heap .
melville	typee	at first kory-kory goes to work quite leisurely , but gradually quickens his pace , and waxing warm in the employment , drives the stick furiously along the smoking channel , plying his hands to and fro with amazing rapidity , the perspiration starting from every pore . as he approaches the climax of his effort , he pants and gasps for breath , and his eyes almost start from their sockets with the violence of his exertions . this is the critical stage of the operation ; all his previous labours are vain if he can not sustain the rapidity of the movement until the reluctant spark is produced . suddenly he stops , becoming perfectly motionless . his hands still retain their hold of the smaller stick , which is pressed convulsively against the further end of the channel among the fine powder there accumulated , as if he had just pierced through and through some little viper that was wriggling and struggling to escape from his clutches . the next moment a delicate wreath of smoke curls spirally into the air , the heap of dusty particles glows with fire , and kory-kory , almost breathless , dismounts from his steed .
melville	typee	this operation appeared to me to be the most laborious species of work performed in typee ; and had i possessed a sufficient intimacy with the language to have conveyed my ideas upon the subject , i should certainly have suggested to the most influential of the natives the expediency of establishing a college of vestals to be centrally located in the valley , for the purpose of keeping alive the indispensable article of fire ; so as to supersede the necessity of such a vast outlay of strength and good temper , as were usually squandered on these occasions . there might , however , be special difficulties in carrying this plan into execution .
melville	typee	what a striking evidence does this operation furnish of the wide difference between the extreme of savage and civilized life . a gentleman of typee can bring up a numerous family of children and give them all a highly respectable cannibal education , with infinitely less toil and anxiety than he expends in the simple process of striking a light ; whilst a poor european artisan , who through the instrumentality of a lucifer performs the same operation in one second , is put to his wit ’ s end to provide for his starving offspring that food which the children of a polynesian father , without troubling their parents , pluck from the branches of every tree around them .
melville	typee	chapter fifteen kindness of marheyo and the rest of the islanders -- a full description of the bread-fruit tree -- different modes of preparing the fruit all the inhabitants of the valley treated me with great kindness ; but as to the household of marheyo , with whom i was now permanently domiciled , nothing could surpass their efforts to minister to my comfort . to the gratification of my palate they paid the most unwearied attention . they continually invited me to partake of food , and when after eating heartily i declined the viands they continued to offer me , they seemed to think that my appetite stood in need of some piquant stimulant to excite its activity .
melville	typee	in pursuance of this idea , old marheyo himself would hie him away to the sea-shore by the break of day , for the purpose of collecting various species of rare sea-weed ; some of which among these people are considered a great luxury . after a whole day spent in this employment , he would return about nightfall with several cocoanut shells filled with different descriptions of kelp . in preparing these for use he manifested all the ostentation of a professed cook , although the chief mystery of the affair appeared to consist in pouring water in judicious quantities upon the slimy contents of his cocoanut shells .
melville	typee	the first time he submitted one of these saline salads to my critical attention i naturally thought that anything collected at such pains must possess peculiar merits ; but one mouthful was a complete dose ; and great was the consternation of the old warrior at the rapidity with which i ejected his epicurean treat .
melville	typee	how true it is , that the rarity of any particular article enhances its value amazingly . in some part of the valley -- i know not where , but probably in the neighbourhood of the sea -- the girls were sometimes in the habit of procuring small quantities of salt , a thimble-full or so being the result of the united labours of a party of five or six employed for the greater part of the day . this precious commodity they brought to the house , enveloped in multitudinous folds of leaves ; and as a special mark of the esteem in which they held me , would spread an immense leaf on the ground , and dropping one by one a few minute particles of the salt upon it , invite me to taste them .
melville	typee	from the extravagant value placed upon the article , i verily believe , that with a bushel of common liverpool salt all the real estate in typee might have been purchased . with a small pinch of it in one hand , and a quarter section of a bread-fruit in the other , the greatest chief in the valley would have laughed at all luxuries of a parisian table .
melville	typee	the celebrity of the bread-fruit tree , and the conspicuous place it occupies in a typee bill of fare , induces me to give at some length a general description of the tree , and the various modes in which the fruit is prepared .
melville	typee	the bread-fruit tree , in its glorious prime , is a grand and towering object , forming the same feature in a marquesan landscape that the patriarchal elm does in new england scenery . the latter tree it not a little resembles in height , in the wide spread of its stalwart branches , and in its venerable and imposing aspect .
melville	typee	the leaves of the bread-fruit are of great size , and their edges are cut and scolloped as fantastically as those of a lady ’ s lace collar . as they annually tend towards decay , they almost rival in brilliant variety of their gradually changing hues the fleeting shades of the expiring dolphin . the autumnal tints of our american forests , glorious as they are , sink into nothing in comparison with this tree .
melville	typee	the leaf , in one particular stage , when nearly all the prismatic colours are blended on its surface , is often converted by the natives into a superb and striking head-dress . the principal fibre traversing its length being split open a convenient distance , and the elastic sides of the aperture pressed apart , the head is inserted between them , the leaf drooping on one side , with its forward half turned jauntily up on the brows , and the remaining part spreading laterally behind the ears .
melville	typee	the fruit somewhat resembles in magnitude and general appearance one of our citron melons of ordinary size ; but , unlike the citron , it has no sectional lines drawn along the outside . its surface is dotted all over with little conical prominences , looking not unlike the knobs , on an antiquated church door . the rind is perhaps an eighth of an inch in thickness ; and denuded of this at the time when it is in the greatest perfection , the fruit presents a beautiful globe of white pulp , the whole of which may be eaten , with the exception of a slender core , which is easily removed .
melville	typee	the bread-fruit , however , is never used , and is indeed altogether unfit to be eaten , until submitted in one form or other to the action of fire . the most simple manner in which this operation is performed , and i think , the best , consists in placing any number of the freshly plucked fruit , when in a particular state of greenness , among the embers of a fire , in the same way that you would roast a potato . after the lapse of ten or fifteen minutes , the green rind embrowns and cracks , showing through the fissures in its sides the milk-white interior . as soon as it cools the rind drops off , and you then have the soft round pulp in its purest and most delicious state . thus eaten , it has a mild and pleasing flavour .
melville	typee	sometimes after having been roasted in the fire , the natives snatch it briskly from the embers , and permitting it to slip out of the yielding rind into a vessel of cold water , stir up the mixture , which they call ‘ bo-a-sho ’ . i never could endure this compound , and indeed the preparation is not greatly in vogue among the more polite typees .
melville	typee	there is one form , however , in which the fruit is occasionally served , that renders it a dish fit for a king . as soon as it is taken from the fire the exterior is removed , the core extracted , and the remaining part is placed in a sort of shallow stone mortar , and briskly worked with a pestle of the same substance . while one person is performing this operation , another takes a ripe cocoanut , and breaking it in halves , which they also do very cleverly , proceeds to grate the juicy meat into fine particles . this is done by means of a piece of mother-of-pearl shell , lashed firmly to the extreme end of a heavy stick , with its straight side accurately notched like a saw . the stick is sometimes a grotesquely-formed limb of a tree , with three or four branches twisting from its body like so many shapeless legs , and sustaining it two or three feet from the ground .
melville	typee	the native , first placing a calabash beneath the nose , as it were , of his curious-looking log-steed , for the purpose of receiving the grated fragments as they fall , mounts astride of it as if it were a hobby-horse , and twirling the inside of his hemispheres of cocoanut around the sharp teeth of the mother-of-pearl shell , the pure white meat falls in snowy showers into the receptacle provided . having obtained a quantity sufficient for his purpose , he places it in a bag made of the net-like fibrous substance attached to all cocoanut trees , and compressing it over the bread-fruit , which being now sufficiently pounded , is put into a wooden bowl -- extracts a thick creamy milk . the delicious liquid soon bubbles round the fruit , and leaves it at last just peeping above its surface .
melville	typee	this preparation is called ‘ kokoo ’ , and a most luscious preparation it is . the hobby-horse and the pestle and mortar were in great requisition during the time i remained in the house of marheyo , and kory-kory had frequent occasion to show his skill in their use .
melville	typee	but the great staple articles of food into which the bread-fruit is converted by these natives are known respectively by the names of amar and poee-poee . at a certain season of the year , when the fruit of the hundred groves of the valley has reached its maturity , and hangs in golden spheres from every branch , the islanders assemble in harvest groups , and garner in the abundance which surrounds them .

melville	omoo	part i chapter i . my reception aboard it was the middle of a bright tropical afternoon that we made good our escape from the bay . the vessel we sought lay with her main-topsail aback about a league from the land , and was the only object that broke the broad expanse of the ocean .
melville	omoo	on approaching , she turned out to be a small , slatternly-looking craft , her hull and spars a dingy black , rigging all slack and bleached nearly white , and everything denoting an ill state of affairs aboard . the four boats hanging from her sides proclaimed her a whaler . leaning carelessly over the bulwarks were the sailors , wild , haggard-looking fellows in scotch caps and faded blue frocks ; some of them with cheeks of a mottled bronze , to which sickness soon changes the rich berry-brown of a seaman ’ s complexion in the tropics .
melville	omoo	on the quarter-deck was one whom i took for the chief mate . he wore a broad-brimmed panama hat , and his spy-glass was levelled as we advanced . when we came alongside , a low cry ran fore and aft the deck , and everybody gazed at us with inquiring eyes . and well they might . to say nothing of the savage boat ’ s crew , panting with excitement , all gesture and vociferation , my own appearance was calculated to excite curiosity . a robe of the native cloth was thrown over my shoulders , my hair and beard were uncut , and i betrayed other evidences of my recent adventure . immediately on gaining the deck , they beset me on all sides with questions , the half of which i could not answer , so incessantly were they put .
melville	omoo	as an instance of the curious coincidences which often befall the sailor , i must here mention that two countenances before me were familiar . one was that of an old man-of-war ’ s-man , whose acquaintance i had made in rio de janeiro , at which place touched the ship in which i sailed from home . the other was a young man whom , four years previous , i had frequently met in a sailor boarding-house in liverpool . i remembered parting with him at prince ’ s dock gates , in the midst of a swarm of police-officers , trackmen , stevedores , beggars , and the like . and here we were again : —years had rolled by , many a league of ocean had been traversed , and we were thrown together under circumstances which almost made me doubt my own existence .
melville	omoo	but a few moments passed ere i was sent for into the cabin by the captain . he was quite a young man , pale and slender , more like a sickly counting-house clerk than a bluff sea-captain . bidding me be seated , he ordered the steward to hand me a glass of pisco . in the state i was , this stimulus almost made me delirious ; so that of all i then went on to relate concerning my residence on the island i can scarcely remember a word . after this i was asked whether i desired to “ ship ” ; of course i said yes ; that is , if he would allow me to enter for one cruise , engaging to discharge me , if i so desired , at the next port . in this way men are frequently shipped on board whalemen in the south seas . my stipulation was acceded to , and the ship ’ s articles handed me to sign .
melville	omoo	the mate was now called below , and charged to make a “ well man ” of me ; not , let it be borne in mind , that the captain felt any great compassion for me , he only desired to have the benefit of my services as soon as possible .
melville	omoo	helping me on deck , the mate stretched me out on the windlass and commenced examining my limb ; and then doctoring it after a fashion with something from the medicine-chest , rolled it up in a piece of an old sail , making so big a bundle that , with my feet resting on the windlass , i might have been taken for a sailor with the gout . while this was going on , someone removing my tappa cloak slipped on a blue frock in its place , and another , actuated by the same desire to make a civilized mortal of me , flourished about my head a great pair lie imminent jeopardy of both ears , and the certain destruction of hair and beard .
melville	omoo	the day was now drawing to a close , and , as the land faded from my sight , i was all alive to the change in my condition . but how far short of our expectations is oftentimes the fulfilment of the most ardent hopes . safe aboard of a ship—so long my earnest prayer—with home and friends once more in prospect , i nevertheless felt weighed down by a melancholy that could not be shaken off . it was the thought of never more seeing those who , notwithstanding their desire to retain me a captive , had , upon the whole , treated me so kindly . i was leaving them for ever .
melville	omoo	so unforeseen and sudden had been my escape , so excited had i been through it all , and so great the contrast between the luxurious repose of the valley , and the wild noise and motion of a ship at sea , that at times my recent adventures had all the strangeness of a dream ; and i could scarcely believe that the same sun now setting over a waste of waters , had that very morning risen above the mountains and peered in upon me as i lay on my mat in typee .
melville	omoo	going below into the forecastle just after dark , i was inducted into a wretched “ bunk ” or sleeping-box built over another . the rickety bottoms of both were spread with several pieces of a blanket . a battered tin can was then handed me , containing about half a pint of “ tea ” —so called by courtesy , though whether the juice of such stalks as one finds floating therein deserves that title , is a matter all shipowners must settle with their consciences . a cube of salt beef , on a hard round biscuit by way of platter , was also handed up ; and without more ado , i made a meal , the salt flavour of which , after the nebuchadnezzar fare of the valley , was positively delicious .
melville	omoo	while thus engaged , an old sailor on a chest just under me was puffing out volumes of tobacco smoke . my supper finished , he brushed the stem of his sooty pipe against the sleeve of his frock , and politely waved it toward me . the attention was sailor-like ; as for the nicety of the thing , no man who has lived in forecastles is at all fastidious ; and so , after a few vigorous whiffs to induce repose , i turned over and tried my best to forget myself . but in vain . my crib , instead of extending fore and aft , as it should have done , was placed athwart ships , that is , at right angles to the keel , and the vessel , going before the wind , rolled to such a degree , that-every time my heels went up and my head went down , i thought i was on the point of turning a somerset . beside this , there were still more annoying causes of inquietude ; and every once in a while a splash of water came down the open scuttle , and flung the spray in my face .
melville	omoo	at last , after a sleepless night , broken twice by the merciless call of the watch , a peep of daylight struggled into view from above , and someone came below . it was my old friend with the pipe .
melville	omoo	“ here , shipmate , ” said i , “ help me out of this place , and let me go on deck. ” “ halloa , who ’ s that croaking ? ” was the rejoinder , as he peered into the obscurity where i lay . “ ay , typee , my king of the cannibals , is it you i but i say , my lad , how ’ s that spar of your ’ n ? the mate says it ’ s in a devil of a way ; and last night set the steward to sharpening the handsaw : hope he won ’ t have the carving of ye . ”
melville	omoo	long before daylight we arrived off the bay of nukuheva , and making short tacks until morning , we then ran in and sent a boat ashore with the natives who had brought me to the ship . upon its return , we made sail again , and stood off from the land . there was a fine breeze ; and notwithstanding my bad night ’ s rest , the cool , fresh air of a morning at sea was so bracing , mat , as soon as i breathed it , my spirits rose at once .
melville	omoo	seated upon the windlass the greater portion of the day , and chatting freely with the men , i learned the history of the voyage thus far , and everything respecting the ship and its present condition .
melville	omoo	these matters i will now throw together in the next chapter . chapter ii . some account of the ship first and foremost , i must give some account of the julia herself ; or “ little jule , ” as the sailors familiarly styled her .
melville	omoo	she was a small barque of a beautiful model , something more than two hundred tons , yankee-built and very old . fitted for a privateer out of a new england port during the war of 1812 , she had been captured at sea by a british cruiser , and , after seeing all sorts of service , was at last employed as a government packet in the australian seas . being condemned , however , about two years previous , she was purchased at auction by a house in sydney , who , after some slight repairs , dispatched her on the present voyage .
melville	omoo	notwithstanding the repairs , she was still in a miserable plight . the lower masts were said to be unsound ; the standing rigging was much worn ; and , in some places , even the bulwarks were quite rotten . still , she was tolerably tight , and but little more than the ordinary pumping of a morning served to keep her free .
melville	omoo	but all this had nothing to do with her sailing ; at that , brave little jule , plump little jule , was a witch . blow high , or blow low , she was always ready for the breeze ; and when she dashed the waves from her prow , and pranced , and pawed the sea , you never thought of her patched sails and blistered hull . how the fleet creature would fly before the wind ! rolling , now and then , to be sure , but in very playfulness . sailing to windward , no gale could bow her over : with spars erect , she looked right up into the wind ’ s eye , and so she went .
melville	omoo	but after all , little jule was not to be confided in . lively enough , and playful she was , but on that very account the more to be distrusted . who knew , but that like some vivacious old mortal all at once sinking into a decline , she might , some dark night , spring a leak and carry us all to the bottom . however , she played us no such ugly trick , and therefore , i wrong little jule in supposing it .
melville	omoo	she had a free roving commission . according to her papers she might go whither she pleased—whaling , sealing , or anything else . sperm whaling , however , was what she relied upon ; though , as yet , only two fish had been brought alongside .
melville	omoo	the day they sailed out of sydney heads , the ship ’ s company , all told , numbered some thirty-two souls ; now , they mustered about twenty ; the rest had deserted . even the three junior mates who had headed the whaleboats were gone : and of the four harpooners , only one was left , a wild new zealander , or “ mowree ” as his countrymen are more commonly called in the pacific . but this was not all . more than half the seamen remaining were more or less unwell from a long sojourn in a dissipated port ; some of them wholly unfit for duty , one or two dangerously ill , and the rest managing to stand their watch though they could do but little .
melville	omoo	the captain was a young cockney , who , a few years before , had emigrated to australia , and , by some favouritism or other , had procured the command of the vessel , though in no wise competent . he was essentially a landsman , and though a man of education , no more meant for the sea than a hairdresser . hence everybody made fun of him . they called him “ the cabin boy , ” “ paper jack , ” and half a dozen other undignified names . in truth , the men made no secret of the derision in which they held him ; and as for the slender gentleman himself , he knew it all very well , and bore himself with becoming meekness . holding as little intercourse with them as possible , he left everything to the chief mate , who , as the story went , had been given his captain in charge . yet , despite his apparent unobtrusiveness , the silent captain had more to do with the men than they thought . in short , although one of your sheepish-looking fellows , he had a sort of still , timid cunning , which no one would have suspected , and which , for that very reason , was all the more active . so the bluff mate , who always thought he did what he pleased , was occasionally made a fool of ; and some obnoxious measures which he carried out , in spite of all growlings , were little thought to originate with the dapper little fellow in nankeen jacket and white canvas pumps . but , to all appearance , at least , the mate had everything his own way ; indeed , in most things this was actually the case ; and it was quite plain that the captain stood in awe of him .
melville	omoo	so far as courage , seamanship , and a natural aptitude for keeping riotous spirits in subjection were concerned , no man was better qualified for his vocation than john jermin . he was the very beau-ideal of the efficient race of short , thick-set men . his hair curled in little rings of iron gray all over his round bullet head . as for his countenance , it was strongly marked , deeply pitted with the small-pox . for the rest , there was a fierce little squint out of one eye ; the nose had a rakish twist to one side ; while his large mouth , and great white teeth , looked absolutely sharkish when he laughed . in a word , no one , after getting a fair look at him , would ever think of improving the shape of his nose , wanting in symmetry as it was . notwithstanding his pugnacious looks , however , jermin had a heart as big as a bullock ’ s ; that you saw at a glance .
melville	omoo	such was our mate ; but he had one failing : he abhorred all weak infusions , and cleaved manfully to strong drink .. at all times he was more or less under the influence of it . taken in moderate quantities , i believe , in my soul , it did a man like him good ; brightened his eyes , swept the cobwebs out of his brain , and regulated his pulse . but the worst of it was , that sometimes he drank too much , and a more obstreperous fellow than jermin in his cups , you seldom came across . he was always for having a fight ; but the very men he flogged loved him as a brother , for he had such an irresistibly good-natured way of knocking them down , that no one could find it in his heart to bear malice against him . so much for stout little jermin .
melville	omoo	all english whalemen are bound by-law to carry a physician , who , of course , is rated a gentleman , and lives in the cabin , with nothing but his professional duties to attend to ; but incidentally he drinks “ flip ” and plays cards with the captain . there was such a worthy aboard of the julia ; but , curious to tell , he lived in the forecastle with the men . and this was the way it happened .
melville	omoo	in the early part of the voyage the doctor and the captain lived together as pleasantly as could be . to say nothing of many a can they drank over the cabin transom , both of them had read books , and one of them had travelled ; so their stories never flagged . but once on a time they got into a dispute about politics , and the doctor , moreover , getting into a rage , drove home an argument with his fist , and left the captain on the floor literally silenced . this was carrying it with a high hand ; so he was shut up in his state-room for ten days , and left to meditate on bread and water , and the impropriety of flying into a passion . smarting under his disgrace , he undertook , a short time after his liberation , to leave the vessel clandestinely at one of the islands , but was brought back ignominiously , and again shut up . being set at large for the second time , he vowed he would not live any longer with the captain , and went forward with his chests among the sailors , where he was received with open arms as a good fellow and an injured man .
melville	omoo	i must give some further account of him , for he figures largely in the narrative . his early history , like that of many other heroes , was enveloped in the profoundest obscurity ; though he threw out hints of a patrimonial estate , a nabob uncle , and an unfortunate affair which sent him a-roving . all that was known , however , was this . he had gone out to sydney as assistant-surgeon of an emigrant ship . on his arrival there , he went back into the country , and after a few months ’ wanderings , returned to sydney penniless , and entered as doctor aboard of the julia .
melville	omoo	his personal appearance was remarkable . he was over six feet high—a tower of bones , with a complexion absolutely colourless , fair hair , and a light unscrupulous gray eye , twinkling occasionally at the very devil of mischief . among the crew , he went by the name of the long doctor , or more frequently still , doctor long ghost . and from whatever high estate doctor long ghost might have fallen , he had certainly at some time or other spent money , drunk burgundy , and associated with gentlemen .
melville	omoo	as for his learning , he quoted virgil , and talked of hobbs of malmsbury , beside repeating poetry by the canto , especially hudibras . he was , moreover , a man who had seen the world . in the easiest way imaginable , he could refer to an amour he had in palermo , his lion-hunting before breakfast among the caffres , and the quality of the coffee to be drunk in muscat ; and about these places , and a hundred others , he had more anecdotes than i can tell of . then such mellow old songs as he sang , in a voice so round and racy , the real juice of sound . how such notes came forth from his lank body was a constant marvel .
melville	omoo	upon the whole , long ghost was as entertaining a companion as one could wish ; and to me in the julia , an absolute godsend . chapter iii . further account of the julia
melville	omoo	owing to the absence of anything like regular discipline , the vessel was in a state of the greatest uproar . the captain , having for some time past been more or less confined to the cabin from sickness , was seldom seen . the mate , however , was as hearty as a young lion , and ran about the decks making himself heard at all hours . bembo , the new zealand harpooner , held little intercourse with anybody but the mate , who could talk to him freely in his own lingo . part of his time he spent out on the bowsprit , fishing for albicores with a bone hook ; and occasionally he waked all hands up of a dark night dancing some cannibal fandango all by himself on the forecastle . but , upon the whole , he was remarkably quiet , though something in his eye showed he was far from being harmless .
melville	omoo	doctor long ghost , having sent in a written resignation as the ship ’ s doctor , gave himself out as a passenger for sydney , and took the world quite easy . as for the crew , those who were sick seemed marvellously contented for men in their condition ; and the rest , not displeased with the general licence , gave themselves little thought of the morrow .
melville	omoo	the julia ’ s provisions were very poor . when opened , the barrels of pork looked as if preserved in iron rust , and diffused an odour like a stale ragout . the beef was worse yet ; a mahogany-coloured fibrous substance , so tough and tasteless , that i almost believed the cook ’ s story of a horse ’ s hoof with the shoe on having been fished up out of the pickle of one of the casks . nor was the biscuit much better ; nearly all of it was broken into hard , little gunflints , honeycombed through and through , as if the worms usually infesting this article in long tropical voyages had , in boring after nutriment , come out at the antipodes without finding anything .
melville	omoo	of what sailors call “ small stores , ” we had but little . “ tea , ” however , we had in abundance ; though , i dare say , the hong merchants never had the shipping of it . beside this , every other day we had what english seamen call “ shot soup ” —great round peas , polishing themselves like pebbles by rolling about in tepid water .
melville	omoo	it was afterward told me , that all our provisions had been purchased by the owners at an auction sale of condemned navy stores in sydney . but notwithstanding the wateriness of the first course of soup , and the saline flavour of the beef and pork , a sailor might have made a satisfactory meal aboard of the julia had there been any side dishes—a potato or two , a yam , or a plantain . but there was nothing of the kind . still , there was something else , which , in the estimation of the men , made up for all deficiencies ; and that was the regular allowance of pisco .
melville	omoo	it may seem strange that in such a state of affairs the captain should be willing to keep the sea with his ship . but the truth was , that by lying in harbour , he ran the risk of losing the remainder of his men by desertion ; and as it was , he still feared that , in some outlandish bay or other , he might one day find his anchor down , and no crew to weigh it .
melville	omoo	with judicious officers the most unruly seamen can at sea be kept in some sort of subjection ; but once get them within a cable ’ s length of the land , and it is hard restraining them . it is for this reason that many south sea whalemen do not come to anchor for eighteen or twenty months on a stretch . when fresh provisions are needed , they run for the nearest land—heave to eight or ten miles off , and send a boat ashore to trade . the crews manning vessels like these are for the most part villains of all nations and dyes ; picked up in the lawless ports of the spanish main , and among the savages of the islands . like galley-slaves , they are only to be governed by scourges and chains . their officers go among them with dirk and pistol—concealed , but ready at a grasp .
melville	omoo	not a few of our own crew were men of this stamp ; but , riotous at times as they were , the bluff drunken energies of jennin were just the thing to hold them in some sort of noisy subjection . upon an emergency , he flew in among them , showering his kicks and cuffs right and left , and “ creating a sensation ” in every direction . and as hinted before , they bore this knock-down authority with great good-humour . a sober , discreet , dignified officer could have done nothing with them ; such a set would have thrown him and his dignity overboard .
melville	omoo	matters being thus , there was nothing for the ship but to keep the sea . nor was the captain without hope that the invalid portion of his crew , as well as himself , would soon recover ; and then there was no telling what luck in the fishery might yet be in store for us . at any rate , at the time of my coming aboard , the report was , that captain guy was resolved upon retrieving the past and filling the vessel with oil in the shortest space possible .
melville	omoo	with this intention , we were now shaping our course for hytyhoo , a village on the island of st. christina—one of the marquesas , and so named by mendanna—for the purpose of obtaining eight seamen , who , some weeks before , had stepped ashore there from the julia . it was supposed that , by this time , they must have recreated themselves sufficiently , and would be glad to return to their duty .
melville	omoo	so to hytyhoo , with all our canvas spread , and coquetting with the warm , breezy trades , we bowled along ; gliding up and down the long , slow swells , the bonettas and albicores frolicking round us .
melville	omoo	chapter iv . a scene in the forecastle i had scarcely been aboard of the ship twenty-four hours , when a circumstance occurred , which , although noways picturesque , is so significant of the state of affairs that i can not forbear relating it .
melville	omoo	in the first place , however , it must be known , that among the crew was a man so excessively ugly , that he went by the ironical appellation of “ beauty. ” he was the ship ’ s carpenter ; and for that reason was sometimes known by his nautical cognomen of “ chips. ” there was no absolute deformity about the man ; he was symmetrically ugly . but ill favoured as he was in person , beauty was none the less ugly in temper ; but no one could blame him ; his countenance had soured his heart . now jermin and beauty were always at swords ’ points . the truth was , the latter was the only man in the ship whom the mate had never decidedly got the better of ; and hence the grudge he bore him . as for beauty , he prided himself upon talking up to the mate , as we shall soon see .
melville	omoo	toward evening there was something to be done on deck , and the carpenter who belonged to the watch was missing . “ where ’ s that skulk , chips ? ” shouted jermin down the forecastle scuttle .
melville	omoo	“ taking his ease , d ’ ye see , down here on a chest , if you want to know , ” replied that worthy himself , quietly withdrawing his pipe from his mouth . this insolence flung the fiery little mate into a mighty rage ; but beauty said nothing , puffing away with all the tranquillity imaginable . here it must be remembered that , never mind what may be the provocation , no prudent officer ever dreams of entering a ship ’ s forecastle on a hostile visit . if he wants to see anybody who happens to be there , and refuses to come up , why he must wait patiently until the sailor is willing . the reason is this . the place is very dark : and nothing is easier than to knock one descending on the head , before he knows where he is , and a very long while before he ever finds out who did it .
melville	omoo	nobody knew this better than jermin , and so he contented himself with looking down the scuttle and storming . at last beauty made some cool observation which set him half wild .
melville	omoo	“ tumble on deck , ” he then bellowed— “ come , up with you , or i ’ ll jump down and make you. ” the carpenter begged him to go about it at once . no sooner said than done : prudence forgotten , jermin was there ; and by a sort of instinct , had his man by the throat before he could well see him . one of the men now made a rush at him , but the rest dragged him off , protesting that they should have fair play .
melville	omoo	“ now come on deck , ” shouted the mate , struggling like a good fellow to hold the carpenter fast . “ take me there , ” was the dogged answer , and beauty wriggled about in the nervous grasp of the other like a couple of yards of boa-constrictor .
melville	omoo	his assailant now undertook to make him up into a compact bundle , the more easily to transport him . while thus occupied , beauty got his arms loose , and threw him over backward . but jermin quickly recovered himself , when for a time they had it every way , dragging each other about , bumping their heads against the projecting beams , and returning each other ’ s blows the first favourable opportunity that offered . unfortunately , jermin at last slipped and fell ; his foe seating himself on his chest , and keeping him down . now this was one of those situations in which the voice of counsel , or reproof , comes with peculiar unction . nor did beauty let the opportunity slip . but the mate said nothing in reply , only foaming at the mouth and struggling to rise .
melville	omoo	just then a thin tremor of a voice was heard from above . it was the captain ; who , happening to ascend to the quarter-deck at the commencement of the scuffle , would gladly have returned to the cabin , but was prevented by the fear of ridicule . as the din increased , and it became evident that his officer was in serious trouble , he thought it would never do to stand leaning over the bulwarks , so he made his appearance on the forecastle , resolved , as his best policy , to treat the matter lightly .
melville	omoo	“ why , why , ” he begun , speaking pettishly , and very fast , “ what ’ s all this about ? —mr . jermin , mr. jermin—carpenter , carpenter ; what are you doing down there ? come on deck ; come on deck. ” whereupon doctor long ghost cries out in a squeak , “ ah ! miss guy , is that you ? now , my dear , go right home , or you ’ ll get hurt . ”
melville	omoo	“ pooh , pooh ! you , sir , whoever you are , i was not speaking to you ; none of your nonsense . mr. jermin , i was talking to you ; have the kindness to come on deck , sir ; i want to see you . ”
melville	omoo	“ and how , in the devil ’ s name , am i to get there ? ” cried the mate , furiously . “ jump down here , captain guy , and show yourself a man . let me up , you chips ! unhand me , i say ! oh ! i ’ ll pay you for this , some day ! come on , captain guy ! ”
melville	omoo	at this appeal , the poor man was seized with a perfect spasm of fidgets . “ pooh , pooh , carpenter ; have done with your nonsense ! let him up , sir ; let him up ! do you hear ? let mr. jermm come on deck ! ”
melville	omoo	“ go along with you , paper jack , ” replied beauty ; “ this quarrel ’ s between the mate and me ; so go aft , where you belong ! ” as the captain once more dipped his head down the scuttle to make answer , from an unseen hand he received , full in the face , the contents of a tin can of soaked biscuit and tea-leaves . the doctor was not far off just then . without waiting for anything more , the discomfited gentleman , with both hands to his streaming face , retreated to the quarter-deck .
melville	omoo	a few moments more , and jermin , forced to a compromise , followed after , in his torn frock and scarred face , looking for all the world as if he had just disentangled himself from some intricate piece of machinery . for about half an hour both remained in the cabin , where the mate ’ s rough tones were heard high above the low , smooth voice of the captain .
melville	omoo	of all his conflicts with the men , this was the first in which jermin had been worsted ; and he was proportionably enraged . upon going below—as the steward afterward told us—he bluntly informed guy that , for the future , he might look out for his ship himself ; for his part , he had done with her , if that was the way he allowed his officers to be treated . after many high words , the captain finally assured him that , the first fitting opportunity , the carpenter should be cordially flogged ; though , as matters stood , the experiment would be a hazardous one . upon this jermin reluctantly consented to drop the matter for the present ; and he soon drowned all thoughts of it in a can of flip , which guy had previously instructed the steward to prepare , as a sop to allay his wrath .
melville	omoo	nothing more ever came of this . chapter v. what happened at hytyhoo less than forty-eight hours after leaving nukuheva , the blue , looming island of st. christina greeted us from afar . drawing near the shore , the grim , black spars and waspish hull of a small man-of-war craft crept into view ; the masts and yards lined distinctly against the sky . she was riding to her anchor in the bay , and proved to be a french corvette .
melville	omoo	this pleased our captain exceedingly , and , coming on deck , he examined her from the mizzen rigging with his glass . his original intention was not to let go an anchor ; but , counting upon the assistance of the corvette in case of any difficulty , he now changed his mind , and anchored alongside of her . as soon as a boat could be lowered , he then went off to pay his respects to the commander , and , moreover , as we supposed , to concert measures for the apprehension of the runaways .
melville	omoo	returning in the course of twenty minutes , he brought along with him two officers in undress and whiskers , and three or four drunken obstreperous old chiefs ; one with his legs thrust into the armholes of a scarlet vest , another with a pair of spurs on his heels , and a third in a cocked hat and feather . in addition to these articles , they merely wore the ordinary costume of their race—a slip of native cloth about the loins . indecorous as their behaviour was , these worthies turned out to be a deputation from the reverend the clergy of the island ; and the object of their visit was to put our ship under a rigorous “ taboo , ” to prevent the disorderly scenes and facilities for desertion which would ensue , were the natives—men and women—allowed to come off to us freely .
melville	omoo	there was little ceremony about the matter . the priests went aside for a moment , laid their shaven old crowns together , and went over a little mummery . whereupon , their leader tore a long strip from his girdle of white tappa , and handed it to one of the french officers , who , after explaining what was to be done , gave it to jermin . the mate at once went out to the end of the flying jib boom , and fastened there the mystic symbol of the ban . this put to flight a party of girls who had been observed swimming toward us . tossing their arms about , and splashing the water like porpoises , with loud cries of “ taboo ! taboo ! ” they turned about and made for the shore .
melville	omoo	the night of our arrival , the mate and the mowree were to stand “ watch and watch , ” relieving each other every four hours ; the crew , as is sometimes customary when lying at an anchor , being allowed to remain all night below . a distrust of the men , however , was , in the present instance , the principal reason for this proceeding . indeed , it was all but certain , that some kind of attempt would be made at desertion ; and therefore , when jermin ’ s first watch came on at eight bells ( midnight ) —by which time all was quiet—he mounted to the deck with a flask of spirits in one hand , and the other in readiness to assail the first countenance that showed itself above the forecastle scuttle .
melville	omoo	thus prepared , he doubtless meant to stay awake ; but for all that , he before long fell asleep ; and slept with such hearty good-will too , that the men who left us that night might have been waked up by his snoring . certain it was , the mate snored most strangely ; and no wonder , with that crooked bugle of his . when he came to himself it was just dawn , but quite light enough to show two boats gone from the side . in an instant he knew what had happened .
melville	omoo	dragging the mowree out of an old sail where he was napping , he ordered him to clear away another boat , and then darted into the cabin to tell the captain the news . springing on deck again , he drove down into the forecastle for a couple of oarsmen , but hardly got there before there was a cry , and a loud splash heard over the side . it was the mowree and the boat—into which he had just leaped to get ready for lowering—rolling over and over in the water .
melville	omoo	the boat having at nightfall been hoisted up to its place over the starboard quarter , someone had so cut the tackles which held it there , that a moderate strain would at once part them . bembo ’ s weight had answered the purpose , showing that the deserters must have ascertained his specific gravity to a fibre of hemp . there was another boat remaining ; but it was as well to examine it before attempting to lower . and it was well they did ; for there was a hole in the bottom large enough to drop a barrel through : she had been scuttled most ruthlessly .
melville	omoo	jermin was frantic . dashing his hat upon deck , he was about to plunge overboard and swim to the corvette for a cutter , when captain guy made his appearance and begged him to stay where he was . by this time the officer of the deck aboard the frenchman had noticed our movements , and hailed to know what had happened . guy informed him through his trumpet , and men to go in pursuit were instantly promised . there was a whistling of a boatswain ’ s pipe , an order or two , and then a large cutter pulled out from the man-of-war ’ s stern , and in half a dozen strokes was alongside . the mate leaped into her , and they pulled rapidly ashore .
melville	omoo	another cutter , carrying an armed crew , soon followed . in an hour ’ s time the first returned , towing the two whale-boats , which had been found turned up like tortoises on the beach .
melville	omoo	noon came , and nothing more was heard from the deserters . meanwhile doctor long ghost and myself lounged about , cultivating an acquaintance , and gazing upon the shore scenery . the bay was as calm as death ; the sun high and hot ; and occasionally a still gliding canoe stole out from behind the headlands , and shot across the water .
melville	omoo	and all the morning long our sick men limped about the deck , casting wistful glances inland , where the palm-trees waved and beckoned them into their reviving shades . poor invalid rascals ! how conducive to the restoration of their shattered health would have been those delicious groves ! but hard-hearted jermin assured them , with an oath , that foot of theirs should never touch the beach .
melville	omoo	toward sunset a crowd was seen coming down to the water . in advance of all were the fugitives—bareheaded—their frocks and trousers hanging in tatters , every face covered with blood and dust , and their arms pinioned behind them with green thongs . following them up , was a shouting rabble of islanders , pricking them with the points of their long spears , the party from the corvette menacing them in flank with their naked cutlasses .
melville	omoo	the bonus of a musket to the king of the bay , and the promise of a tumblerful of powder for every man caught , had set the whole population on their track ; and so successful was the hunt , that not only were that morning ’ s deserters brought back , but five of those left behind on a former visit . the natives , however , were the mere hounds of the chase , raising the game in their coverts , but leaving the securing of it to the frenchmen . here , as elsewhere , the islanders have no idea of taking part in such a scuffle as ensues upon the capture of a party of desperate seamen .
melville	omoo	the runaways were at once brought aboard , and , though they looked rather sulky , soon came round , and treated the whole affair as a frolicsome adventure . chapter vi . we touch at la dominica
melville	omoo	fearful of spending another night at hytyhoo , captain guy caused the ship to be got under way shortly after dark . the next morning , when all supposed that we were fairly embarked for a long cruise , our course was suddenly altered for la dominica , or hivarhoo , an island just north of the one we had quitted . the object of this , as we learned , was to procure , if possible , several english sailors , who , according to the commander of the corvette , had recently gone ashore there from an american whaler , and were desirous of shipping aboard one of their own country vessels .
melville	omoo	we made the land in the afternoon , coming abreast of a shady glen opening from a deep bay , and winding by green denies far out of sight . “ hands by the weather-main-brace ! ” roared the mate , jumping up on the bulwarks ; and in a moment the prancing julia , suddenly arrested in her course , bridled her head like a steed reined in , while the foam flaked under her bows .
melville	omoo	this was the place where we expected to obtain the men ; so a boat was at once got in readiness to go ashore . now it was necessary to provide a picked crew—men the least likely to abscond . after considerable deliberation on the part of the captain and mate , four of the seamen were pitched upon as the most trustworthy ; or rather they were selected from a choice assortment of suspicious characters as being of an inferior order of rascality .
melville	omoo	armed with cutlasses all round—the natives were said to be an ugly set—they were followed over the side by the invalid captain , who , on this occasion , it seems , was determined to signalize himself . accordingly , in addition to his cutlass , he wore an old boarding belt , in which was thrust a brace of pistols . they at once shoved off .
melville	omoo	my friend long ghost had , among other things which looked somewhat strange in a ship ’ s forecastle , a capital spy-glass , and on the present occasion we had it in use . when the boat neared the head of the inlet , though invisible to the naked eye , it was plainly revealed by the glass ; looking no bigger than an egg-shell , and the men diminished to pigmies .
melville	omoo	at last , borne on what seemed a long flake of foam , the tiny craft shot up the beach amid a shower of sparkles . not a soul was there . leaving one of their number by the water , the rest of the pigmies stepped ashore , looking about them very circumspectly , pausing now and then hand to ear , and peering under a dense grove which swept down within a few paces of the sea . no one came , and to all appearances everything was as still as the grave . presently he with the pistols , followed by the rest flourishing their bodkins , entered the wood and were soon lost to view . they did not stay long ; probably anticipating some inhospitable ambush were they to stray any distance up the glen .
melville	omoo	in a few moments they embarked again , and were soon riding pertly over the waves of the bay . all of a sudden the captain started to his feet—the boat spun round , and again made for the shore . some twenty or thirty natives armed with spears which through the glass looked like reeds , had just come out of the grove , and were apparently shouting to the strangers not to be in such a hurry , but return and be sociable . but they were somewhat distrusted , for the boat paused about its length from the beach , when the captain standing up in its head delivered an address in pantomime , the object of which seemed to be , that the islanders should draw near . one of them stepped forward and made answer , seemingly again urging the strangers not to be diffident , but beach their boat . the captain declined , tossing his arms about in another pantomime . in the end he said something which made them shake their spears ; whereupon he fired a pistol among them , which set the whole party running ; while one poor little fellow , dropping his spear and clapping his hand behind him , limped away in a manner which almost made me itch to get a shot at his assailant .
melville	omoo	wanton acts of cruelty like this are not unusual on the part of sea captains landing at islands comparatively unknown . even at the pomotu group , but a day ’ s sail from tahiti , the islanders coming down to the shore have several times been fired at by trading schooners passing through their narrow channels ; and this too as a mere amusement on the part of the ruffians .
melville	omoo	indeed , it is almost incredible , the light in which many sailors regard these naked heathens . they hardly consider them human . but it is a curious fact , that the more ignorant and degraded men are , the more contemptuously they look upon those whom they deem their inferiors .
melville	omoo	all powers of persuasion being thus lost upon these foolish savages , and no hope left of holding further intercourse , the boat returned to the ship . chapter vii . what happened at hannamanoo
melville	omoo	on the other side of the island was the large and populous bay of hannamanoo , where the men sought might yet be found . but as the sun was setting by the time the boat came alongside , we got our offshore tacks aboard and stood away for an offing . about daybreak we wore , and ran in , and by the time the sun was well up , entered the long , narrow channel dividing the islands of la dominica and st. christina .
melville	omoo	on one hand was a range of steep green bluffs hundreds of feet high , the white huts of the natives here and there nestling like birds ’ nests in deep clefts gushing with verdure . across the water , the land rolled away in bright hillsides , so warm and undulating that they seemed almost to palpitate in the sun . on we swept , past bluff and grove , wooded glen and valley , and dark ravines lighted up far inland with wild falls of water . a fresh land-breeze filled our sails , the embayed waters were gentle as a lake , and every wave broke with a tinkle against our coppered prow .
melville	omoo	on gaining the end of the channel we rounded a point , and came full upon the bay of hannamanoo . this is the only harbour of any note about the island , though as far as a safe anchorage is concerned it hardly deserves the title .
melville	omoo	before we held any communication with the shore , an incident occurred which may convey some further idea of the character of our crew . having approached as near the land as we could prudently , our headway was stopped , and we awaited the arrival of a canoe which was coming out of the bay . all at once we got into a strong current , which swept us rapidly toward a rocky promontory forming one side of the harbour . the wind had died away ; so two boats were at once lowered for the purpose of pulling the ship ’ s head round . before this could be done , the eddies were whirling upon all sides , and the rock so near that it seemed as if one might leap upon it from the masthead . notwithstanding the speechless fright of the captain , and the hoarse shouts of the unappalled jennin , the men handled the ropes as deliberately as possible , some of them chuckling at the prospect of going ashore , and others so eager for the vessel to strike , that they could hardly contain themselves . unexpectedly a countercurrent befriended us , and assisted by the boats we were soon out of danger .
melville	omoo	what a disappointment for our crew ! all their little plans for swimming ashore from the wreck , and having a fine time of it for the rest of their days , thus cruelly nipped in the bud .
melville	omoo	soon after , the canoe came alongside . in it were eight or ten natives , comely , vivacious-looking youths , all gesture and exclamation ; the red feathers in their head-bands perpetually nodding . with them also came a stranger , a renegade from christendom and humanity—a white man , in the south sea girdle , and tattooed in the face . a broad blue band stretched across his face from ear to ear , and on his forehead was the taper figure of a blue shark , nothing but fins from head to tail .
melville	omoo	some of us gazed upon this man with a feeling akin to horror , no ways abated when informed that he had voluntarily submitted to this embellishment of his countenance . what an impress ! far worse than cain ’ s—his was perhaps a wrinkle , or a freckle , which some of our modern cosmetics might have effaced ; but the blue shark was a mark indelible , which all the waters of abana and pharpar , rivers of damascus , could never wash out . he was an englishman , lem hardy he called himself , who had deserted from a trading brig touching at the island for wood and water some ten years previous . he had gone ashore as a sovereign power armed with a musket and a bag of ammunition , and ready if need were , to prosecute war on his own account . the country was divided by the hostile kings of several large valleys . with one of them , from whom he first received overtures , he formed an alliance , and became what he now was , the military leader of the tribe , and war-god of the entire island .
melville	omoo	his campaigns beat napoleon ’ s . in one night attack , his invincible musket , backed by the light infantry of spears and javelins , vanquished two clans , and the next morning brought all the others to the feet of his royal ally .
melville	omoo	nor was the rise of his domestic fortunes at all behind the corsican ’ s : three days after landing , the exquisitely tattooed hand of a princess was his ; receiving along with the damsel as her portion , one thousand fathoms of fine tappa , fifty double-braided mats of split grass , four hundred hogs , ten houses in different parts of her native valley , and the sacred protection of an express edict of the taboo , declaring his person inviolable for ever .
melville	omoo	now , this man was settled for life , perfectly satisfied with his circumstances , and feeling no desire to return to his friends . “ friends , ” indeed , he had none . he told me his history . thrown upon the world a foundling , his paternal origin was as much a mystery to him as the genealogy of odin ; and , scorned by everybody , he fled the parish workhouse when a boy , and launched upon the sea . he had followed it for several years , a dog before the mast , and now he had thrown it up for ever .
melville	omoo	and for the most part , it is just this sort of men—so many of whom are found among sailors—uncared for by a single soul , without ties , reckless , and impatient of the restraints of civilization , who are occasionally found quite at home upon the savage islands of the pacific . and , glancing at their hard lot in their own country , what marvel at their choice ?
melville	omoo	according to the renegado , there was no other white man on the island ; and as the captain could have no reason to suppose that hardy intended to deceive us , he concluded that the frenchmen were in some way or other mistaken in what they had told us . however , when our errand was made known to the rest of our visitors , one of them , a fine , stalwart fellow , his face all eyes and expression , volunteered for a cruise . all the wages he asked was a red shirt , a pair of trousers , and a hat , which were to be put on there and then ; besides a plug of tobacco and a pipe . the bargain was struck directly ; but wymontoo afterward came in with a codicil , to the effect that a friend of his , who had come along with him , should be given ten whole sea-biscuits , without crack or flaw , twenty perfectly new and symmetrically straight nails , and one jack-knife . this being agreed to , the articles were at once handed over ; the native receiving them with great avidity , and in the absence of clothing , using his mouth as a pocket to put the nails in . two of them , however , were first made to take the place of a pair of ear-ornaments , curiously fashioned out of bits of whitened wood .
melville	omoo	it now began breezing strongly from seaward , and no time was to be lost in getting away from the land ; so after an affecting rubbing of noses between our new shipmate and his countrymen , we sailed away with him .
melville	omoo	to our surprise , the farewell shouts from the canoe , as we dashed along under bellied royals , were heard unmoved by our islander ; but it was not long thus . that very evening , when the dark blue of his native hills sunk in the horizon , the poor savage leaned over the bulwarks , dropped his head upon his chest , and gave way to irrepressible emotions . the ship was plunging hard , and wymontoo , sad to tell , in addition to his other pangs , was terribly sea-sick .
melville	omoo	chapter viii . the tattooers of la dominica for a while leaving little jule to sail away by herself , i will here put down some curious information obtained from hardy . the renegado had lived so long on the island that its customs were quite familiar ; and i much lamented that , from the shortness of our stay , he could not tell us more than he did .
melville	omoo	from the little intelligence gathered , however , i learned to my surprise that , in some things , the people of hivarhoo , though of the same group of islands , differed considerably from my tropical friends in the valley of typee .
melville	omoo	as his tattooing attracted so much remark , hardy had a good deal to say concerning the manner in which that art was practised upon the island . throughout the entire cluster the tattooers of hivarhoo enjoyed no small reputation . they had carried their art to the highest perfection , and the profession was esteemed most honourable . no wonder , then , that like genteel tailors , they rated their services very high ; so much so that none but those belonging to the higher classes could afford to employ them . so true was this , that the elegance of one ’ s tattooing was in most cases a sure indication of birth and riches .
melville	omoo	professors in large practice lived in spacious houses , divided by screens of tappa into numerous little apartments , where subjects were waited upon in private . the arrangement chiefly grew out of a singular ordinance of the taboo , which enjoined the strictest privacy upon all men , high and low , while under the hands of a tattooer . for the time , the slightest intercourse with others is prohibited , and the small portion of food allowed is pushed under the curtain by an unseen hand . the restriction with regard to food , is intended to reduce the blood , so as to diminish the inflammation consequent upon puncturing the skin . as it is , this comes on very soon , and takes some time to heal ; so that the period of seclusion generally embraces many days , sometimes several weeks .
melville	omoo	all traces of soreness vanished , the subject goes abroad ; but only again to return ; for , on account of the pain , only a small surface can be operated upon at once ; and as the whole body is to be more or less embellished by a process so slow , the studios alluded to are constantly filled . indeed , with a vanity elsewhere unheard of , many spend no small portion of their days thus sitting to an artist .
melville	omoo	to begin the work , the period of adolescence is esteemed the most suitable . after casting about for some eminent tattooer , the friends of the youth take him to his house to have the outlines of the general plan laid out . it behoves the professor to have a nice eye , for a suit to be worn for life should be well cut .
melville	omoo	some tattooers , yearning after perfection , employ , at large wages , one or two men of the commonest order—vile fellows , utterly regardless of appearances , upon whom they first try their patterns and practise generally . their backs remorselessly scrawled over , and no more canvas remaining , they are dismissed and ever after go about , the scorn of their countrymen .
melville	omoo	hapless wights ! thus martyred in the cause of the fine arts . beside the regular practitioners , there are a parcel of shabby , itinerant tattooers , who , by virtue of their calling , stroll unmolested from one hostile bay to another , doing their work dog-cheap for the multitude . they always repair to the various religious festivals , which gather great crowds . when these are concluded , and the places where they are held vacated even by the tattooers , scores of little tents of coarse tappa are left standing , each with a solitary inmate , who , forbidden to talk to his unseen neighbours , is obliged to stay there till completely healed . the itinerants are a reproach to their profession , mere cobblers , dealing in nothing but jagged lines and clumsy patches , and utterly incapable of soaring to those heights of fancy attained by the gentlemen of the faculty .
melville	omoo	all professors of the arts love to fraternize ; and so , in hannamanoo , the tattooers came together in the chapters of their worshipful order . in this society , duly organized , and conferring degrees , hardy , from his influence as a white , was a sort of honorary grand master . the blue shark , and a sort of urim and thummim engraven upon his chest , were the seal of his initiation . all over hivarhoo are established these orders of tattooers . the way in which the renegado ’ s came to be founded is this . a year or two after his landing there happened to be a season of scarcity , owing to the partial failure of the breadfruit harvest for several consecutive seasons . this brought about such a falling off in the number of subjects for tattooing that the profession became quite needy . the royal ally of hardy , however , hit upon a benevolent expedient to provide for their wants , at the same time conferring a boon upon many of his subjects .
melville	omoo	by sound of conch-shell it was proclaimed before the palace , on the beach , and at the head of the valley , that noomai , king of hannamanoo , and friend of hardee-hardee , the white , kept open heart and table for all tattooers whatsoever ; but to entitle themselves to this hospitality , they were commanded to practise without fee upon the meanest native soliciting their services .
melville	omoo	numbers at once flocked to the royal abode , both artists and sitters . it was a famous time ; and the buildings of the palace being “ taboo ” to all but the tattooers and chiefs , the sitters bivouacked on the common , and formed an extensive encampment .
melville	omoo	the “ lora tattoo , ” or the time of tattooing , will be long remembered . an enthusiastic sitter celebrated the event in verse . several lines were repeated to us by hardy , some of which , in a sort of colloquial chant he translated nearly thus :
melville	omoo	“ where is that sound ? in hannamanoo . and wherefore that sound ? the sound of a hundred hammers , tapping , tapping , tapping the shark teeth. ” “ where is that light ? round about the king ’ s house , and the small laughter ? the small , merry laughter it is of the sons and daughters of the tattooed . ”
melville	omoo	chapter ix . we steer to the westward—state of affairs the night we left hannamanoo was bright and starry , and so warm that , when the watches were relieved , most of the men , instead of going below , flung themselves around the foremast .
melville	omoo	toward morning , finding the heat of the forecastle unpleasant , i ascended to the deck where everything was noiseless . the trades were blowing with a mild , steady strain upon the canvas , and the ship heading right out into the immense blank of the western pacific . the watch were asleep . with one foot resting on the rudder , even the man at the helm nodded , and the mate himself , with arms folded , was leaning against the capstan .
melville	omoo	on such a night , and all alone , reverie was inevitable . i leaned over the side , and could not help thinking of the strange objects we might be sailing over . but my meditations were soon interrupted by a gray , spectral shadow cast over the heaving billows . it was the dawn , soon followed by the first rays of the morning . they flashed into view at one end of the arched night , like—to compare great things with small—the gleamings of guy fawkes ’ s lantern in the vaults of the parliament house . before long , what seemed a live ember rested for a moment on the rim of the ocean , and at last the blood-red sun stood full and round in the level east , and the long sea-day began .
melville	omoo	breakfast over , the first thing attended to was the formal baptism of wymontoo , who , after thinking over his affairs during the night , looked dismal enough . there were various opinions as to a suitable appellation . some maintained that we ought to call him “ sunday , ” that being the day we caught him ; others , “ eighteen forty-two , ” the then year of our lord ; while doctor long ghost remarked that he ought , by all means , to retain his original name , —wymontoo-hee , meaning ( as he maintained ) , in the figurative language of the island , something analogous to one who had got himself into a scrape . the mate put an end to the discussion by sousing the poor fellow with a bucket of salt water , and bestowing upon him the nautical appellation of “ luff . ”
melville	omoo	though a certain mirthfulness succeeded his first pangs at leaving home , wymontoo—we will call him thus—gradually relapsed into his former mood , and became very melancholy . often i noticed him crouching apart in the forecastle , his strange eyes gleaming restlessly , and watching the slightest movement of the men . many a time he must have been thinking of his bamboo hut , when they were talking of sydney and its dance-houses .
melville	omoo	we were now fairly at sea , though to what particular cruising-ground we were going , no one knew ; and , to all appearances , few cared . the men , after a fashion of their own , began to settle down into the routine of sea-life , as if everything was going on prosperously . blown along over a smooth sea , there was nothing to do but steer the ship , and relieve the “ look-outs ” at the mast-heads . as for the sick , they had two or three more added to their number—the air of the island having disagreed with the constitutions of several of the runaways . to crown all , the captain again relapsed , and became quite ill .
melville	omoo	the men fit for duty were divided into two small watches , headed respectively by the mate and the mowree ; the latter by virtue of his being a harpooner , succeeding to the place of the second mate , who had absconded .
melville	omoo	in this state of things whaling was out of the question ; but in the face of everything , jermin maintained that the invalids would soon be well . however that might be , with the same pale hue sky overhead , we kept running steadily to the westward . forever advancing , we seemed always in the same place , and every day was the former lived over again . we saw no ships , expected to see none . no sign of life was perceptible but the porpoises and other fish sporting under the bows like pups ashore . but , at intervals , the gray albatross , peculiar to these seas , came flapping his immense wings over us , and then skimmed away silently as if from a plague-ship . or flights of the tropic bird , known among seamen as the “ boatswain , ” wheeled round and round us , whistling shrilly as they flew .
melville	omoo	the uncertainty hanging over our destination at this time , and the fact that we were abroad upon waters comparatively little traversed , lent an interest to this portion of the cruise which i shall never forget .
melville	omoo	from obvious prudential considerations the pacific has been principally sailed over in known tracts , and this is the reason why new islands are still occasionally discovered by exploring ships and adventurous whalers notwithstanding the great number of vessels of all kinds of late navigating this vast ocean . indeed , considerable portions still remain wholly unexplored ; and there is doubt as to the actual existence of certain shoals , and reefs , and small clusters of islands vaguely laid down in the charts . the mere circumstance , therefore , of a ship like ours penetrating into these regions , was sufficient to cause any reflecting mind to feel at least a little uneasy . for my own part , the many stories i had heard of ships striking at midnight upon unknown rocks , with all sail set , and a slumbering crew , often recurred to me , especially , as from the absence of discipline , and our being so shorthanded , the watches at night were careless in the extreme .
melville	omoo	but no thoughts like these were entertained by my reckless shipmates ; and along we went , the sun every evening setting right ahead of our jib boom . for what reason the mate was so reserved with regard to our precise destination was never made known . the stories he told us , i , for one , did not believe ; deeming them all a mere device to lull the crew .
melville	omoo	he said we were bound to a fine cruising ground , scarcely known to other whalemen , which he had himself discovered when commanding a small brig upon a former voyage . here , the sea was alive with large whales , so tame that all you had to do was to go up and kill them : they were too frightened to resist . a little to leeward of this was a small cluster of islands , where we were going to refit , abounding with delicious fruits , and peopled by a race almost wholly unsophisticated by intercourse with strangers .
melville	omoo	in order , perhaps , to guard against the possibility of anyone finding out the precise latitude and longitude of the spot we were going to , jermin never revealed to us the ship ’ s place at noon , though such is the custom aboard of most vessels .
melville	omoo	meanwhile , he was very assiduous in his attention to the invalids . doctor long ghost having given up the keys of the medicine-chest , they were handed over to him ; and , as physician , he discharged his duties to the satisfaction of all . pills and powders , in most cases , were thrown to the fish , and in place thereof , the contents of a mysterious little quarter cask were produced , diluted with water from the “ butt. ” his draughts were mixed on the capstan , in cocoa-nut shells marked with the patients ’ names . like shore doctors , he did not eschew his own medicines , for his professional calls in the forecastle were sometimes made when he was comfortably tipsy : nor did he omit keeping his invalids in good-humour , spinning his yarns to them , by the hour , whenever he went to see them .
melville	omoo	owing to my lameness , from which i soon began to recover , i did no active duty , except standing an occasional “ trick ” at the helm . it was in the forecastle chiefly , that i spent my time , in company with the long doctor , who was at great pains to make himself agreeable . his books , though sadly torn and tattered , were an invaluable resource . i read them through again and again , including a learned treatise on the yellow fever . in addition to these , he had an old file of sydney papers , and i soon became intimately acquainted with the localities of all the advertising tradesmen there . in particular , the rhetorical flourishes of stubbs , the real-estate auctioneer , diverted me exceedingly , and i set him down as no other than a pupil of robins the londoner .
melville	omoo	aside from the pleasure of his society , my intimacy with long ghost was of great service to me in other respects . his disgrace in the cabin only confirmed the good-will of the democracy in the forecastle ; and they not only treated him in the most friendly manner , but looked up to him with the utmost deference , besides laughing heartily at all his jokes . as his chosen associate , this feeling for him extended to me , and gradually we came to be regarded in the light of distinguished guests . at meal-times we were always first served , and otherwise were treated with much respect .
melville	omoo	among other devices to kill time , during the frequent calms , long ghost hit upon the game of chess . with a jack-knife , we carved the pieces quite tastefully out of bits of wood , and our board was the middle of a chest-lid , chalked into squares , which , in playing , we straddled at either end . having no other suitable way of distinguishing the sets , i marked mine by tying round them little scarfs of black silk , torn from an old neck-handkerchief . putting them in mourning this way , the doctor said , was quite appropriate , seeing that they had reason to feel sad three games out of four . of chess , the men never could make head nor tail ; indeed , their wonder rose to such a pitch that they at last regarded the mysterious movements of the game with something more than perplexity ; and after puzzling over them through several long engagements , they came to the conclusion that we must be a couple of necromancers .
melville	omoo	chapter x . a sea-parlour described , with some of its tenants i might as well give some idea of the place in which the doctor and i lived together so sociably .
melville	omoo	most persons know that a ship ’ s forecastle embraces the forward part of the deck about the bowsprit : the same term , however , is generally bestowed upon the sailors ’ sleeping-quarters , which occupy a space immediately beneath , and are partitioned off by a bulkhead .
melville	omoo	planted right in the bows , or , as sailors say , in the very eyes of the ship , this delightful apartment is of a triangular shape , and is generally fitted with two tiers of rude bunks . those of the julia were in a most deplorable condition , mere wrecks , some having been torn down altogether to patch up others ; and on one side there were but two standing . but with most of the men it made little difference whether they had a bunk or not , since , having no bedding , they had nothing to put in it but themselves .
melville	omoo	upon the boards of my own crib i spread all the old canvas and old clothes i could pick up . for a pillow , i wrapped an old jacket round a log . this helped a little the wear and tear of one ’ s bones when the ship rolled .
melville	omoo	rude hammocks made out of old sails were in many cases used as substitutes for the demolished bunks ; but the space they swung in was so confined that they were far from being agreeable .
melville	omoo	the general aspect of the forecastle was dungeon-like and dingy in the extreme . in the first place , it was not five feet from deck to deck and even this space was encroached upon by two outlandish cross-timbers bracing the vessel , and by the sailors ’ chests , over which you must needs crawl in getting about . at meal-times , and especially when we indulged in after-dinner chat , we sat about the chests like a parcel of tailors .
melville	omoo	in the middle of all were two square , wooden columns , denominated in marine architecture “ bowsprit bitts. ” they were about a foot apart , and between them , by a rusty chain , swung the forecastle lamp , burning day and night , and forever casting two long black shadows . lower down , between the bitts , was a locker , or sailors ’ pantry , kept in abominable disorder , and sometimes requiring a vigorous cleaning and fumigation .
melville	omoo	all over , the ship was in a most dilapidated condition ; but in the forecastle it looked like the hollow of an old tree going to decay . in every direction the wood was damp and discoloured , and here and there soft and porous . moreover , it was hacked and hewed without mercy , the cook frequently helping himself to splinters for kindling-wood from the bitts and beams . overhead , every carline was sooty , and here and there deep holes were burned in them , a freak of some drunken sailors on a voyage long previous .
melville	omoo	from above , you entered by a plank , with two elects , slanting down from the scuttle , which was a mere hole in the deck . there being no slide to draw over in case of emergency , the tarpaulin temporarily placed there was little protection from the spray heaved over the bows ; so that in anything of a breeze the place was miserably wet . in a squall , the water fairly poured down in sheets like a cascade , swashing about , and afterward spirting up between the chests like the jets of a fountain .
melville	omoo	such were our accommodations aboard of the julia ; but bad as they were , we had not the undisputed possession of them . myriads of cockroaches , and regiments of rats disputed the place with us . a greater calamity than this can scarcely befall a vessel in the south seas .
melville	omoo	so warm is the climate that it is almost impossible to get rid of them . you may seal up every hatchway , and fumigate the hull till the smoke forces itself out at the seams , and enough will survive to repeople the ship in an incredibly short period . in some vessels , the crews of which after a hard fight have given themselves up , as it were , for lost , the vermin seem to take actual possession , the sailors being mere tenants by sufferance . with sperm whalemen , hanging about the line , as many of them do for a couple of years on a stretch , it is infinitely worse than with other vessels .
melville	omoo	as for the julia , these creatures never had such free and easy times as they did in her crazy old hull ; every chink and cranny swarmed with them ; they did not live among you , but you among them . so true was this , that the business of eating and drinking was better done in the dark than in the light of day .
melville	omoo	concerning the cockroaches , there was an extraordinary phenomenon , for which none of us could ever account . every night they had a jubilee . the first symptom was an unusual clustering and humming among the swarms lining the beams overhead , and the inside of the sleeping-places . this was succeeded by a prodigious coming and going on the part of those living out of sight presently they all came forth ; the larger sort racing over the chests and planks ; winged monsters darting to and fro in the air ; and the small fry buzzing in heaps almost in a state of fusion .
melville	omoo	on the first alarm , all who were able darted on deck ; while some of the sick who were too feeble , lay perfectly quiet—the distracted vermin running over them at pleasure . the performance lasted some ten minutes , during which no hive ever hummed louder . often it was lamented by us that the time of the visitation could never be predicted ; it was liable to come upon us at any hour of the night , and what a relief it was , when it happened to fall in the early part of the evening .
melville	omoo	nor must i forget the rats : they did not forget me . tame as trenck ’ s mouse , they stood in their holes peering at you like old grandfathers in a doorway . often they darted in upon us at meal-times , and nibbled our food . the first time they approached wymontoo , he was actually frightened ; but becoming accustomed to it , he soon got along with them much better than the rest . with curious dexterity he seized the animals by their legs , and flung them up the scuttle to find a watery grave .
melville	omoo	but i have a story of my own to tell about these rats . one day the cabin steward made me a present of some molasses , which i was so choice of that i kept it hid away in a tin can in the farthest corner of my bunk .. faring as we did , this molasses dropped upon a biscuit was a positive luxury , which i shared with none but the doctor , and then only in private . and sweet as the treacle was , how could bread thus prepared and eaten in secret be otherwise than pleasant ?
melville	omoo	one night our precious can ran low , and in canting it over in the dark , something beside the molasses slipped out . how long it had been there , kind providence never revealed ; nor were we over anxious to know ; for we hushed up the bare thought as quickly as possible . the creature certainly died a luscious death , quite equal to clarence ’ s in the butt of malmsey .
melville	omoo	chapter xi . doctor long ghost a wag—one of his capers grave though he was at times , doctor long ghost was a decided wag . everyone knows what lovers of fun sailors are ashore—afloat , they are absolutely mad after it . so his pranks were duly appreciated .
melville	omoo	the poor old black cook ! unlashing his hammock for the night , and finding a wet log fast asleep in it ; and then waking in the morning with his woolly head tarred . opening his coppers , and finding an old boot boiling away as saucy as could be , and sometimes cakes of pitch candying in his oven .
melville	omoo	baltimore ’ s tribulations were indeed sore ; there was no peace for him day nor night . poor fellow ! he was altogether too good-natured . say what they will about easy-tempered people , it is far better , on some accounts , to have the temper of a wolf . whoever thought of taking liberties with gruff black dan ?
melville	omoo	the most curious of the doctor ’ s jokes , was hoisting the men aloft by the foot or shoulder , when they fell asleep on deck during the night-watches . ascending from the forecastle on one occasion , he found every soul napping , and forthwith went about his capers . fastening a rope ’ s end to each sleeper , he rove the lines through a number of blocks , and conducted them all to the windlass ; then , by heaving round cheerily , in spite of cries and struggles , he soon had them dangling aloft in all directions by arms and legs . waked by the uproar , we rushed up from below , and found the poor fellows swinging in the moonlight from the tops and lower yard-arms , like a parcel of pirates gibbeted at sea by a cruiser .
melville	omoo	connected with this sort of diversion was another prank of his . during the night some of those on deck would come below to light a pipe , or take a mouthful of beef and biscuit . sometimes they fell asleep ; and being missed directly that anything was to be done , their shipmates often amused themselves by running them aloft with a pulley dropped down the scuttle from the fore-top .
melville	omoo	one night , when all was perfectly still , i lay awake in the forecastle ; the lamp was burning low and thick , and swinging from its blackened beam ; and with the uniform motion of the ship , the men in the bunks rolled slowly from side to side ; the hammocks swaying in unison .
melville	omoo	presently i heard a foot upon the ladder , and looking up , saw a wide trousers ’ leg . immediately , navy bob , a stout old triton , stealthily descended , and at once went to groping in the locker after something to eat .
melville	omoo	supper ended , he proceeded to load his pipe . now , for a good comfortable smoke at sea , there never was a better place than the julia ’ s forecastle at midnight . to enjoy the luxury , one wants to fall into a kind of dreamy reverie , only known to the children of the weed . and the very atmosphere of the place , laden as it was with the snores of the sleepers , was inducive of this . no wonder , then , that after a while bob ’ s head sunk upon his breast ; presently his hat fell off , the extinguished pipe dropped from his mouth , and the next moment he lay out on the chest as tranquil as an infant .
melville	omoo	suddenly an order was heard on deck , followed by the trampling of feet and the hauling of rigging . the yards were being braced , and soon after the sleeper was missed : for there was a whispered conference over the scuttle .
melville	omoo	directly a shadow glided across the forecastle and noiselessly approached the unsuspecting bob . it was one of the watch with the end of a rope leading out of sight up the scuttle . pausing an instant , the sailor pressed softly the chest of his victim , sounding his slumbers ; and then hitching the cord to his ankle , returned to the deck .
melville	omoo	hardly was his back turned , when a long limb was thrust from a hammock opposite , and doctor long ghost , leaping forth warily , whipped the rope from bob ’ s ankle , and fastened it like lightning to a great lumbering chest , the property of the man who had just disappeared .
melville	omoo	scarcely was the thing done , when lo ! with a thundering bound , the clumsy box was torn from its fastenings , and banging from side to side , flew toward the scuttle . here it jammed ; and thinking that bob , who was as strong as a windlass , was grappling a beam and trying to cut the line , the jokers on deck strained away furiously . on a sudden , the chest went aloft , and striking against the mast , flew open , raining down on the heads of a party the merciless shower of things too numerous to mention .
melville	omoo	of course the uproar roused all hands , and when we hurried on deck , there was the owner of the box , looking aghast at its scattered contents , and with one wandering hand taking the altitude of a bump on his head .
melville	omoo	chapter xii . death and burial of two of the crew the mirthfulness which at times reigned among us was in strange and shocking contrast with the situation of some of the invalids . thus at least did it seem to me , though not to others .
melville	omoo	but an event occurred about this period , which , in removing by far the most pitiable cases of suffering , tended to make less grating to my feelings the subsequent conduct of the crew .
melville	omoo	we had been at sea about twenty days , when two of the sick who had rapidly grown worse , died one night within an hour of each other . one occupied a bunk right next to mine , and for several days had not risen from it . during this period he was often delirious , starting up and glaring around him , and sometimes wildly tossing his arms .
melville	omoo	on the night of his decease , i retired shortly after the middle watch began , and waking from a vague dream of horrors , felt something clammy resting on me . it was the sick man ’ s hand . two or three times during the evening previous , he had thrust it into my bunk , and i had quietly removed it ; but now i started and flung it from me . the arm fell stark and stiff , and i knew that he was dead .
melville	omoo	waking the men , the corpse was immediately rolled up in the strips of blanketing upon which it lay , and carried on deck . the mate was then called , and preparations made for an instantaneous ’ burial . laying the body out on the forehatch , it was stitched up in one of the hammocks , some “ kentledge ” being placed at the feet instead of shot . this done , it was borne to the gangway , and placed on a plank laid across the bulwarks . two men supported the inside end . by way of solemnity , the ship ’ s headway was then stopped by hauling aback the main-top-sail .
melville	omoo	the mate , who was far from being sober , then staggered up , and holding on to a shroud , gave the word . as the plank tipped , the body slid off slowly , and fell with a splash into the sea . a bubble or two , and nothing more was seen .
melville	omoo	“ brace forward ! ” the main-yard swung round to its place , and the ship glided on , whilst the corpse , perhaps , was still sinking . we had tossed a shipmate to the sharks , but no one would have thought it , to have gone among the crew immediately after . the dead man had been a churlish , unsocial fellow , while alive , and no favourite ; and now that he was no more , little thought was bestowed upon him . all that was said was concerning the disposal of his chest , which , having been always kept locked , was supposed to contain money . someone volunteered to break it open , and distribute its contents , clothing and all , before the captain should demand it .
melville	omoo	while myself and others were endeavouring to dissuade them from this , all started at a cry from the forecastle . there could be no one there but two of the sick , unable to crawl on deck . we went below , and found one of them dying on a chest . he had fallen out of his hammock in a fit , and was insensible . the eyes were open and fixed , and his breath coming and going convulsively . the men shrunk from him ; but the doctor , taking his hand , held it a few moments in his , and suddenly letting it fall , exclaimed , “ he ’ s gone ! ” the body was instantly borne up the ladder .
melville	omoo	another hammock was soon prepared , and the dead sailor stitched up as before . some additional ceremony , however , was now insisted upon , and a bible was called for . but none was to be had , not even a prayer book . when this was made known , antone , a portuguese , from the cape-de-verd islands , stepped up , muttering something over the corpse of his countryman , and , with his finger , described upon the back of the hammock the figure of a large cross ; whereupon it received the death-launch .
melville	omoo	these two men both perished from the proverbial indiscretions of seamen , heightened by circumstances apparent ; but had either of them been ashore under proper treatment , he would , in all human probability , have recovered .
melville	omoo	behold here the fate of a sailor ! they give him the last toss , and no one asks whose child he was . for the rest of that night there was no more sleep . many stayed on deck until broad morning , relating to each other those marvellous tales of the sea which the occasion was calculated to call forth . little as i believed in such things , i could not listen to some of these stories unaffected . above all was i struck by one of the carpenter ’ s .
melville	omoo	on a voyage to india , they had a fever aboard , which carried off nearly half the crew in the space of a few days . after this the men never went aloft in the night-time , except in couples . when topsails were to be reefed , phantoms were seen at the yard-arm ends ; and in tacking ship , voices called aloud from the tops . the carpenter himself , going with another man to furl the main-top-gallant-sail in a squall , was nearly pushed from the rigging by an unseen hand ; and his shipmate swore that a wet hammock was flirted in his face .
melville	omoo	stories like these were related as gospel truths , by those who declared themselves eye-witnesses . it is a circumstance not generally known , perhaps , that among ignorant seamen , philanders , or finns , as they are more commonly called , are regarded with peculiar superstition . for some reason or other , which i never could get at , they are supposed to possess the gift of second sight , and the power to wreak supernatural vengeance upon those who offend them . on this account they have great influence among sailors , and two or three with whom i have sailed at different times were persons well calculated to produce this sort of impression , at least upon minds disposed to believe in such things .
melville	omoo	now , we had one of these sea-prophets aboard ; an old , yellow-haired fellow , who always wore a rude seal-skin cap of his own make , and carried his tobacco in a large pouch made of the same stuff . van , as we called him , was a quiet , inoffensive man , to look at , and , among such a set , his occasional peculiarities had hitherto passed for nothing . at this time , however , he came out with a prediction , which was none the less remarkable from its absolute fulfilment , though not exactly in the spirit in which it was given out .
melville	omoo	the night of the burial he laid his hand on the old horseshoe nailed as a charm to the foremast , and solemnly told us that , in less than three weeks , not one quarter of our number would remain aboard the ship—by that time they would have left her for ever .
melville	omoo	some laughed ; flash jack called him an old fool ; but among the men generally it produced a marked effect . for several days a degree of quiet reigned among us , and allusions of such a kind were made to recent events , as could be attributed to no other cause than the finn ’ s omen .
melville	omoo	for my own part , what had lately come to pass was not without its influence . it forcibly brought to mind our really critical condition . doctor long ghost , too , frequently revealed his apprehensions , and once assured me that he would give much to be safely landed upon any island around us .
melville	omoo	where we were , exactly , no one but the mate seemed to know , nor whither we were going . the captain—a mere cipher—was an invalid in his cabin ; to say nothing more of so many of his men languishing in the forecastle .
melville	omoo	our keeping the sea under these circumstances , a matter strange enough at first , now seemed wholly unwarranted ; and added to all was the thought that our fate was absolutely in the hand of the reckless jermin . were anything to happen to him , we would be left without a navigator , for , according to jermin himself , he had , from the commencement of the voyage , always kept the ship ’ s reckoning , the captain ’ s nautical knowledge being insufficient .
melville	omoo	but considerations like these , strange as it may seem , seldom or never occurred to the crew . they were alive only to superstitious fears ; and when , in apparent contradiction to the finn ’ s prophecy , the sick men rallied a little , they began to recover their former spirits , and the recollection of what had occurred insensibly faded from their minds . in a week ’ s time , the unworthiness of little jule as a sea vessel , always a subject of jest , now became more so than ever . in the forecastle , flash jack , with his knife , often dug into the dank , rotten planks ribbed between us and death , and flung away the splinters with some sea joke .
melville	omoo	as to the remaining invalids , they were hardly ill enough to occasion any serious apprehension , at least for the present , in the breasts of such thoughtless beings as themselves . and even those who suffered the most , studiously refrained from any expression of pain .
melville	omoo	the truth is , that among sailors as a class , sickness at sea is so heartily detested , and the sick so little cared for , that the greatest invalid generally strives to mask his sufferings . he has given no sympathy to others , and he expects none in return . their conduct , in this respect , so opposed to their generous-hearted behaviour ashore , painfully affects the landsman on his first intercourse with them as a sailor .
melville	omoo	sometimes , but seldom , our invalids inveighed against their being kept at sea , where they could be of no service , when they ought to be ashore and in the way of recovery . but— “ oh ! cheer up—cheer up , my hearties ! ” —the mate would say . and after this fashion he put a stop to their murmurings .
melville	omoo	but there was one circumstance , to which heretofore i have but barely alluded , that tended more than anything else to reconcile many to their situation . this was the receiving regularly , twice every day , a certain portion of pisco , which was served out at the capstan , by the steward , in little tin measures called “ tots . ”
melville	omoo	the lively affection seamen have for strong drink is well known ; but in the south seas , where it is so seldom to be had , a thoroughbred sailor deems scarcely any price too dear which will purchase his darling “ tot. ” nowadays , american whalemen in the pacific never think of carrying spirits as a ration ; and aboard of most of them , it is never served out even in times of the greatest hardships . all sydney whalemen , however , still cling to the old custom , and carry it as a part of the regular supplies for the voyage .
melville	omoo	in port , the allowance of pisco was suspended ; with a view , undoubtedly , of heightening the attractions of being out of sight of land . now , owing to the absence of proper discipline , our sick , in addition to what they took medicinally , often came in for their respective “ tots ” convivially ; and , added to all this , the evening of the last day of the week was always celebrated by what is styled on board of english vessels “ the saturday-night bottles. ” two of these were sent down into the forecastle , just after dark ; one for the starboard watch , and the other for the larboard .
melville	omoo	by prescription , the oldest seaman in each claims the treat as his , and , accordingly , pours out the good cheer and passes it round like a lord doing the honours of his table . but the saturday-night bottles were not all . the carpenter and cooper , in sea parlance , chips and bungs , who were the “ cods , ” or leaders of the forecastle , in some way or other , managed to obtain an extra supply , which perpetually kept them in fine after-dinner spirits , and , moreover , disposed them to look favourably upon a state of affairs like the present .
melville	omoo	but where were the sperm whales all this time ? in good sooth , it made little matter where they were , since we were in no condition to capture them . about this time , indeed , the men came down from the mast-heads , where , until now , they had kept up the form of relieving each other every two hours . they swore they would go there no more . upon this , the mate carelessly observed that they would soon be where look-outs were entirely unnecessary , the whales he had in his eye ( though flash jack said they were all in his ) being so tame that they made a practice of coming round ships , and scratching their backs against them .
melville	omoo	thus went the world of waters with us , some four weeks or more after leaving hannamanoo . chapter xiii . our destination changed it was not long after the death of the two men , that captain guy was reported as fast declining , and in a day or two more , as dying . the doctor , who previously had refused to enter the cabin upon any consideration , now relented , and paid his old enemy a professional visit .
melville	omoo	he prescribed a warm bath , which was thus prepared . the skylight being removed , a cask was lowered down into the cabin , and then filled with buckets of water from the ship ’ s coppers . the cries of the patient , when dipped into his rude bath , were most painful to hear . they at last laid him on the transom , more dead than alive .
melville	omoo	that evening , the mate was perfectly sober , and coming forward to the windlass , where we were lounging , summoned aft the doctor , myself , and two or three others of his favourites ; when , in the presence of bembo the mowree , he spoke to us thus :
melville	omoo	“ i have something to say to ye , men . there ’ s none but bembo here as belongs aft , so i ’ ve picked ye out as the best men for ’ ard to take counsel with , d ’ ye see , consarning the ship . the captain ’ s anchor is pretty nigh atrip ; i shouldn ’ t wonder if he croaked afore morning . so what ’ s to be done ? if we have to sew him up , some of those pirates there for ’ ard may take it into their heads to run off with the ship , because there ’ s no one at the tiller . now , i ’ ve detarmined what ’ s best to be done ; but i don ’ t want to do it unless i ’ ve good men to back me , and make things all fair and square if ever we get home again . ”
melville	omoo	we all asked what his plan was . “ i ’ ll tell ye what it is , men . if the skipper dies , all agree to obey my orders , and in less than three weeks i ’ ll engage to have five hundred barrels of sperm oil under hatches : enough to give every mother ’ s son of ye a handful of dollars when we get to sydney . if ye don ’ t agree to this , ye won ’ t have a farthing coming to ye . ”
melville	omoo	doctor long ghost at once broke in . he said that such a thing was not to be dreamt of ; that if the captain died , the mate was in duty bound to navigate the ship to the nearest civilized port , and deliver her up into an english consul ’ s hands ; when , in all probability , after a run ashore , the crew would be sent home . everything forbade the mate ’ s plan . “ still , ” said he , assuming an air of indifference , “ if the men say stick it out , stick it out say i ; but in that case , the sooner we get to those islands of yours the better . ”
melville	omoo	something more he went on to say ; and from the manner in which the rest regarded him , it was plain that our fate was in his hands . it was finally resolved upon , that if captain guy was no better in twenty-four hours , the ship ’ s head should be pointed for the island of tahiti .
melville	omoo	this announcement produced a strong sensation—the sick rallied—and the rest speculated as to what was next to befall us ; while the doctor , without alluding to guy , congratulated me upon the prospect of soon beholding a place so famous as the island in question .
melville	omoo	the night after the holding of the council , i happened to go on deck in the middle watch , and found the yards braced sharp up on the larboard tack , with the south east trades strong on our bow . the captain was no better ; and we were off for tahiti .
melville	omoo	chapter xiv . rope yarn while gliding along on our way , i can not well omit some account of a poor devil we had among us , who went by the name of rope yarn , or ropey .
melville	omoo	he was a nondescript who had joined the ship as a landsman . being so excessively timid and awkward , it was thought useless to try and make a sailor of him ; so he was translated into the cabin as steward ; the man previously filling that post , a good seaman , going among the crew and taking his place . but poor ropey proved quite as clumsy among the crockery as in the rigging ; and one day when the ship was pitching , having stumbled into the cabin with a wooden tureen of soup , he scalded the officers so that they didn ’ t get over it in a week . upon which , he was dismissed , and returned to the forecastle .
melville	omoo	now , nobody is so heartily despised as a pusillanimous , lazy , good-for-nothing land-lubber ; a sailor has no bowels of compassion for him . yet , useless as such a character may be in many respects , a ship ’ s company is by no means disposed to let him reap any benefit from his deficiencies . regarded in the light of a mechanical power , whenever there is any plain , hard work to be done , he is put to it like a lever ; everyone giving him a pry .
melville	omoo	then , again , he is set about all the vilest work . is there a heavy job at tarring to be done , he is pitched neck and shoulders into a tar-barrel , and set to work at it . moreover , he is made to fetch and carry like a dog . like as not , if the mate sends him after his quadrant , on the way he is met by the captain , who orders him to pick some oakum ; and while he is hunting up a bit of rope , a sailor comes along and wants to know what the deuce he ’ s after , and bids him be off to the forecastle .
melville	omoo	“ obey the last order , ” is a precept inviolable at sea . so the land-lubber , afraid to refuse to do anything , rushes about distracted , and does nothing : in the end receiving a shower of kicks and cuffs from all quarters .
melville	omoo	added to his other hardships , he is seldom permitted to open his mouth unless spoken to ; and then , he might better keep silent . alas for him ! if he should happen to be anything of a droll ; for in an evil hour should he perpetrate a joke , he would never know the last of it .
melville	omoo	the witticisms of others , however , upon himself , must be received in the greatest good-humour . woe be unto him , if at meal-times he so much as look sideways at the beef-kid before the rest are helped .
melville	omoo	then he is obliged to plead guilty to every piece of mischief which the real perpetrator refuses to acknowledge ; thus taking the place of that sneaking rascal nobody , ashore . in short , there is no end to his tribulations .
melville	omoo	the land-lubber ’ s spirits often sink , and the first result of his being moody and miserable is naturally enough an utter neglect of his toilet . the sailors perhaps ought to make allowances ; but heartless as they are , they do not . no sooner is his cleanliness questioned than they rise upon him like a mob of the middle ages upon a jew ; drag him into the lee-scuppers , and strip him to the buff . in vain he bawls for mercy ; in vain calls upon the captain to save him .
melville	omoo	alas ! i say again , for the land-lubber at sea . he is the veriest wretch the watery world over . and such was rope tarn ; of all landlubbers , the most lubberly and most miserable . a forlorn , stunted , hook-visaged mortal he was too ; one of those whom you know at a glance to have been tried hard and long in the furnace of affliction . his face was an absolute puzzle ; though sharp and sallow , it had neither the wrinkles of age nor the smoothness of youth ; so that for the soul of me , i could hardly tell whether he was twenty-five or fifty .
melville	omoo	but to his history . in his better days , it seems he had been a journeyman baker in london , somewhere about holborn ; and on sundays wore a hue coat and metal buttons , and spent his afternoons in a tavern , smoking his pipe and drinking his ale like a free and easy journeyman baker that he was . but this did not last long ; for an intermeddling old fool was the ruin of him . he was told that london might do very well for elderly gentlemen and invalids ; but for a lad of spirit , australia was the land of promise . in a dark day ropey wound up his affairs and embarked .
melville	omoo	arriving in sydney with a small capital , and after a while waxing snug and comfortable by dint of hard kneading , he took unto himself a wife ; and so far as she was concerned , might then have gone into the country and retired ; for she effectually did his business . in short , the lady worked him woe in heart and pocket ; and in the end , ran off with his till and his foreman . ropey went to the sign of the pipe and tankard ; got fuddled ; and over his fifth pot meditated suicide—an intention carried out ; for the next day he shipped as landsman aboard the julia , south seaman .
melville	omoo	the ex-baker would have fared far better , had it not been for his heart , which was soft and underdone . a kind word made a fool of him ; and hence most of the scrapes he got into . two or three wags , aware of his infirmity , used to “ draw him out ” in conversation whenever the most crabbed and choleric old seamen were present .
melville	omoo	to give an instance . the watch below , just waked from their sleep , are all at breakfast ; and ropey , in one corner , is disconsolately partaking of its delicacies . “ now , sailors newly waked are no cherubs ; and therefore not a word is spoken , everybody munching his biscuit , grim and unshaven . at this juncture an affable-looking scamp—flash jack—crosses the forecastle , tin can in hand , and seats himself beside the land-lubber .
melville	omoo	“ hard fare this , ropey , ” he begins ; “ hard enough , too , for them that ’ s known better and lived in lun ’ nun . i say now , ropey , s ’ posing you were back to holborn this morning , what would you have for breakfast , eh ? ”
melville	omoo	“ have for breakfast ! ” cried ropey in a rapture . “ don ’ t speak of it ! ” “ what ails that fellow ? ” here growled an old sea-bear , turning round savagely . “ oh , nothing , nothing , ” said jack ; and then , leaning over to rope yarn , he bade him go on , but speak lower .
melville	omoo	“ well , then , ” said he , in a smuggled tone , his eyes lighting up like two lanterns , “ well , then , i ’ d go to mother moll ’ s that makes the great muffins : i ’ d go there , you know , and cock my foot on the ’ ob , and call for a noggin o ’ somethink to begin with . ”
melville	omoo	“ what then , ropey ? ” “ why then , flashy , ” continued the poor victim , unconsciously warming with his theme : “ why then , i ’ d draw my chair up and call for betty , the gal wot tends to customers . betty , my dear , says i , you looks charmin ’ this mornin ’ ; give me a nice rasher of bacon and h ’ eggs , betty my love ; and i wants a pint of h ’ ale , and three nice h ’ ot muffins and butter—and a slice of cheshire ; and betty , i wants— ”
melville	omoo	“ a shark-steak , and be hanged to you ! ” roared black dan , with an oath . whereupon , dragged over the chests , the ill-starred fellow is pummelled on deck . i always made a point of befriending poor ropey when i could ; and , for this reason , was a great favourite of his .
melville	omoo	chapter xv . chips and bungs bound into port , chips and bungs increased their devotion to the bottle ; and , to the unspeakable envy of the rest , these jolly companions—or “ the partners , ” as the men called them—rolled about deck , day after day , in the merriest mood imaginable .
melville	omoo	but jolly as they were in the main , two more discreet tipplers it would be hard to find . no one ever saw them take anything , except when the regular allowance was served out by the steward ; and to make them quite sober and sensible , you had only to ask them how they contrived to keep otherwise . some time after , however , their secret leaked out .
melville	omoo	the casks of pisco were kept down the after-hatchway , which , for this reason , was secured with bar and padlock . the cooper , nevertheless , from time to time , effected a burglarious entry , by descending into the fore-hold ; and then , at the risk of being jammed to death , crawling along over a thousand obstructions , to where the casks were stowed .
melville	omoo	on the first expedition , the only one to be got at lay among others , upon its bilge with the bung-hole well over . with a bit of iron hoop , suitably bent , and a good deal of prying and punching , the bung was forced in ; and then the cooper ’ s neck-handkerchief , attached to the end of the hoop , was drawn in and out—the absorbed liquor being deliberately squeezed into a small bucket .
melville	omoo	bungs was a man after a barkeeper ’ s own heart . drinking steadily , until just manageably tipsy , he contrived to continue so ; getting neither more nor less inebriated , but , to use his own phrase , remaining “ just about right. ” when in this interesting state , he had a free lurch in his gait , a queer way of hitching up his waistbands , looked unnecessarily steady at you when speaking , and for the rest , was in very tolerable spirits . at these times , moreover , he was exceedingly patriotic ; and in a most amusing way , frequently showed his patriotism whenever he happened to encounter dunk , a good-natured , square-faced dane , aboard .
melville	omoo	it must be known here , by the bye , that the cooper had a true sailor admiration for lord nelson . but he entertained a very erroneous idea of the personal appearance of the hero . not content with depriving him of an eye and an arm , he stoutly maintained that he had also lost a leg in one of his battles . under this impression , he sometimes hopped up to dunk with one leg curiously locked behind him into his right arm , at the same time closing an eye .
melville	omoo	in this attitude he would call upon him to look up , and behold the man who gave his countrymen such a thrashing at copenhagen . “ look you , dunk , ” says he , staggering about , and winking hard with one eye to keep the other shut , “ look you ; one man—hang me , half a man—with one leg , one arm , one eye—hang me , with only a piece of a carcase , flogged your whole shabby nation . do you deny it you lubber ? ”
melville	omoo	the dane was a mule of a man , and understanding but little english , seldom made anything of a reply ; so the cooper generally dropped his leg , and marched off , with the air of a man who despised saying anything further .
melville	omoo	chapter xvi . we encounter a gale the mild blue weather we enjoyed after leaving the marquesas gradually changed as we ran farther south and approached tahiti . in these generally tranquil seas , the wind sometimes blows with great violence ; though , as every sailor knows , a spicy gale in the tropic latitudes of the pacific is far different from a tempest in the howling north atlantic . we soon found ourselves battling with the waves , while the before mild trades , like a woman roused , blew fiercely , but still warmly , in our face .
melville	omoo	for all this , the mate carried sail without stint ; and as for brave little jule , she stood up to it well ; and though once in a while floored in the trough of a sea , sprang to her keel again and showed play . every old timber groaned—every spar buckled—every chafed cord strained ; and yet , spite of all , she plunged on her way like a racer . jermin , sea-jockey that he was , sometimes stood in the fore-chains , with the spray every now and then dashing over him , and shouting out , “ well done , jule—dive into it , sweetheart . hurrah ! ”
melville	omoo	one afternoon there was a mighty queer noise aloft , which set the men running in every direction . it was the main-t ’ -gallant-mast . crash ! it broke off just above the cap , and held there by the rigging , dashed with every roll from side to side , with all the hamper that belonged to it . the yard hung by a hair , and at every pitch , thumped against the cross-trees ; while the sail streamed in ribbons , and the loose ropes coiled , and thrashed the air , like whip-lashes . “ stand from under ! ” and down came the rattling blocks , like so many shot . the yard , with a snap and a plunge , went hissing into the sea , disappeared , and shot its full length out again . the crest of a great wave then broke over it—the ship rushed by—and we saw the stick no more .
melville	omoo	while this lively breeze continued , baltimore , our old black cook , was in great tribulation . like most south seamen , the julia ’ s “ caboose , ” or cook-house , was planted on the larboard side of the forecastle . under such a press of canvas , and with the heavy sea running the barque , diving her bows under , now and then shipped green glassy waves , which , breaking over the head-rails , fairly deluged that part of the ship , and washed clean aft . the caboose-house—thought to be fairly lashed down to its place—served as a sort of breakwater to the inundation .
melville	omoo	about these times , baltimore always wore what he called his “ gale suit , ” among other things comprising a sou ’ -wester and a huge pair of well-anointed sea-boots , reaching almost to his knees . thus equipped for a ducking or a drowning , as the case might be , our culinary high-priest drew to the slides of his temple , and performed his sooty rites in secret .
melville	omoo	so afraid was the old man of being washed overboard that he actually fastened one end of a small line to his waistbands , and coiling the rest about him , made use of it as occasion required . when engaged outside , he unwound the cord , and secured one end to a ringbolt in the deck ; so that if a chance sea washed him off his feet , it could do nothing more .
melville	omoo	one evening just as he was getting supper , the julia reared up on her stern like a vicious colt , and when she settled again forward , fairly dished a tremendous sea . nothing could withstand it . one side of the rotten head-bulwarks came in with a crash ; it smote the caboose , tore it from its moorings , and after boxing it about , dashed it against the windlass , where it stranded . the water then poured along the deck like a flood rolling over and over , pots , pans , and kettles , and even old baltimore himself , who went breaching along like a porpoise .
melville	omoo	striking the taffrail , the wave subsided , and washing from side to side , left the drowning cook high and dry on the after-hatch : his extinguished pipe still between his teeth , and almost bitten in two .
melville	omoo	the few men on deck having sprung into the main-rigging , sailor-like , did nothing but roar at his calamity . the same night , our flying-jib-boom snapped off like a pipe-stem , and our spanker-gaff came down by the run .
melville	omoo	by the following morning , the wind in a great measure had gone down ; the sea with it ; and by noon we had repaired our damages as well as we could , and were sailing along as pleasantly as ever .
melville	omoo	but there was no help for the demolished bulwarks ; we had nothing to replace them ; and so , whenever it breezed again , our dauntless craft went along with her splintered prow dripping , but kicking up her fleet heels just as high as before .
melville	omoo	chapter xvii . the coral islands how far we sailed to the westward after leaving the marquesas , or what might have been our latitude and longitude at any particular time , or how many leagues we voyaged on our passage to tahiti , are matters about which , i am sorry to say , i can not with any accuracy enlighten the reader . jermin , as navigator , kept our reckoning ; and , as hinted before , kept it all to himself . at noon , he brought out his quadrant , a rusty old thing , so odd-looking that it might have belonged to an astrologer .
melville	omoo	sometimes , when rather flustered from his potations , he went staggering about deck , instrument to eye , looking all over for the sun—a phenomenon which any sober observer might have seen right overhead . how upon earth he contrived , on some occasions , to settle his latitude , is more than i can tell . the longitude he must either have obtained by the rule of three , or else by special revelation . not that the chronometer in the cabin was seldom to be relied on , or was any ways fidgety ; quite the contrary ; it stood stock-still ; and by that means , no doubt , the true greenwich time—at the period of stopping , at least—was preserved to a second .
melville	omoo	the mate , however , in addition to his “ dead reckoning , ” pretended to ascertain his meridian distance from bow bells by an occasional lunar observation . this , i believe , consists in obtaining with the proper instruments the angular distance between the moon and some one of the stars . the operation generally requires two observers to take sights , and at one and the same time .
melville	omoo	now , though the mate alone might have been thought well calculated for this , inasmuch as he generally saw things double , the doctor was usually called upon to play a sort of second quadrant to jermin ’ s first ; and what with the capers of both , they used to furnish a good deal of diversion . the mate ’ s tremulous attempts to level his instrument at the star he was after , were comical enough . for my own part , when he did catch sight of it , i hardly knew how he managed to separate it from the astral host revolving in his own brain .
melville	omoo	however , by hook or by crook , he piloted us along ; and before many days , a fellow sent aloft to darn a rent in the fore-top-sail , threw his hat into the air , and bawled out “ land , ho ! ”
melville	omoo	land it was ; but in what part of the south seas , jermin alone knew , and some doubted whether even he did . but no sooner was the announcement made , than he came running on deck , spy-glass in hand , and clapping it to his eye , turned round with the air of a man receiving indubitable assurance of something he was quite certain of before . the land was precisely that for which he had been steering ; and , with a wind , in less than twenty-four hours we would sight tahiti . what he said was verified .
melville	omoo	the island turned out to be one of the pomotu or low group—sometimes called the coral islands—perhaps the most remarkable and interesting in the pacific . lying to the east of tahiti , the nearest are within a day ’ s sail of that place .
melville	omoo	they are very numerous ; mostly small , low , and level ; sometimes wooded , but always covered with verdure . many are crescent-shaped ; others resemble a horse-shoe in figure . these last are nothing more than narrow circles of land surrounding a smooth lagoon , connected by a single opening with the sea . some of the lagoons , said to have subterranean outlets , have no visible ones ; the inclosing island , in such cases , being a complete zone of emerald . other lagoons still , are girdled by numbers of small , green islets , very near to each other .
melville	omoo	the origin of the entire group is generally ascribed to the coral insect . according to some naturalists , this wonderful little creature , commencing its erections at the bottom of the sea , after the lapse of centuries , carries them up to the surface , where its labours cease . here , the inequalities of the coral collect all floating bodies ; forming , after a time , a soil , in which the seeds carried thither by birds germinate , and cover the whole with vegetation . here and there , all over this archipelago , numberless naked , detached coral formations are seen , just emerging , as it were from the ocean . these would appear to be islands in the very process of creation—at any rate , one involuntarily concludes so , on beholding them .
melville	omoo	as far as i know , there are but few bread-fruit trees in any part of the pomotu group . in many places the cocoa-nut even does not grow ; though , in others , it largely flourishes . consequently , some of the islands are altogether uninhabited ; others support but a single family ; and in no place is the population very large . in some respects the natives resemble the tahitians : their language , too , is very similar . the people of the southeasterly clusters—concerning whom , however , but little is known—have a bad name as cannibals ; and for that reason their hospitality is seldom taxed by the mariner .
melville	omoo	within a few years past , missionaries from the society group have settled among the leeward islands , where the natives have treated them kindly . indeed , nominally , many of these people are now christians ; and , through the political influence of their instructors , no doubt , a short time since came tinder the allegiance of pomaree , the queen of tahiti ; with which island they always carried on considerable intercourse .
melville	omoo	the coral islands are principally visited by the pearl-shell fishermen , who arrive in small schooners , carrying not more than five or six men . for a long while the business was engrossed by merenhout , the french consul at tahiti , but a dutchman by birth , who , in one year , is said to have sent to france fifty thousand dollars ’ worth of shells . the oysters are found in the lagoons , and about the reefs ; and , for half-a-dozen nails a day , or a compensation still less , the natives are hired to dive after them .
melville	omoo	a great deal of cocoa-nut oil is also obtained in various places . some of the uninhabited islands are covered with dense groves ; and the ungathered nuts which have fallen year after year , lie upon the ground in incredible quantities . two or three men , provided with the necessary apparatus for trying out the oil , will , in the course of a week or two , obtain enough to load one of the large sea-canoes .
melville	omoo	cocoa-nut oil is now manufactured in different parts of the south seas , and forms no small part of the traffic carried on with trading vessels . a considerable quantity is annually exported from the society islands to sydney . it is used in lamps and for machinery , being much cheaper than the sperm , and , for both purposes , better than the right-whale oil . they bottle it up in large bamboos , six or eight feet long ; and these form part of the circulating medium of tahiti .
melville	omoo	to return to the ship . the wind dying away , evening came on before we drew near the island . but we had it in view during the whole afternoon . it was small and round , presenting one enamelled level , free from trees , and did not seem four feet above the water . beyond it was another and larger island , about which a tropical sunset was throwing its glories ; flushing all that part of the heavens , and making it flame like a vast dyed oriel illuminated .
melville	omoo	the trades scarce filled our swooning sails ; the air was languid with the aroma of a thousand strange , flowering shrubs . upon inhaling it , one of the sick , who had recently shown symptoms of scurvy , cried out in pain , and was carried below . this is no unusual effect in such instances .
melville	omoo	on we glided , within less than a cable ’ s length of the shore which was margined with foam that sparkled all round . within , nestled the still , blue lagoon . no living thing was seen , and , for aught we knew , we might have been the first mortals who had ever beheld the spot . the thought was quickening to the fancy ; nor could i help dreaming of the endless grottoes and galleries , far below the reach of the mariner ’ s lead .
melville	omoo	and what strange shapes were lurking there ! think of those arch creatures , the mermaids , chasing each other in and out of the coral cells , and catching their long hair in the coral twigs !
melville	omoo	chapter xviii . tahiti at early dawn of the following morning we saw the peaks of tahiti . in clear weather they may be seen at the distance of ninety miles . “ hivarhoo ! ” shouted wymontoo , overjoyed , and running out upon the bowsprit when the land was first faintly descried in the distance . but when the clouds floated away , and showed the three peaks standing like obelisks against the sky ; and the bold shore undulating along the horizon , the tears gushed from his eyes . poor fellow ! it was not hivarhoo . green hivarhoo was many a long league off .
melville	omoo	tahiti is by far the most famous island in the south seas ; indeed , a variety of causes has made it almost classic . its natural features alone distinguish it from the surrounding groups . two round and lofty promontories , whose mountains rise nine thousand feet above the level of the ocean , are connected by a low , narrow isthmus ; the whole being some one hundred miles in circuit . from the great central peaks of the larger peninsula—orohena , aorai , and pirohitee—the land radiates on all sides to the sea in sloping green ridges . between these are broad and shadowy valleys—in aspect , each a tempe—watered with fine streams , and thickly wooded . unlike many of the other islands , there extends nearly all round tahiti a belt of low , alluvial soil , teeming with the richest vegetation . here , chiefly , the natives dwell .
melville	omoo	seen from the sea , the prospect is magnificent . it is one mass of shaded tints of green , from beach to mountain top ; endlessly diversified with valleys , ridges , glens , and cascades . over the ridges , here and there , the loftier peaks fling their shadows , and far down the valleys . at the head of these , the waterfalls flash out into the sunlight , as if pouring through vertical bowers of verdure . such enchantment , too , breathes over the whole , that it seems a fairy world , all fresh and blooming from the hand of the creator .
melville	omoo	upon a near approach , the picture loses not its attractions . it is no exaggeration to say that , to a european of any sensibility , who , for the first time , wanders back into these valleys—away from the haunts of the natives—the ineffable repose and beauty of the landscape is such , that every object strikes him like something seen in a dream ; and for a time he almost refuses to believe that scenes like these should have a commonplace existence . no wonder that the french bestowed upon the island the appellation of the new cytherea . “ often , ” says de bourgainville , “ i thought i was walking in the garden of eden . ”
melville	omoo	nor , when first discovered , did the inhabitants of this charming country at all diminish the wonder and admiration of the voyager . their physical beauty and amiable dispositions harmonized completely with the softness of their clime . in truth , everything about them was calculated to awaken the liveliest interest . glance at their civil and religious institutions . to their king , divine rights were paid ; while for poetry , their mythology rivalled that of ancient greece .
melville	omoo	of tahiti , earlier and more full accounts were given , than of any other island in polynesia ; and this is the reason why it still retains so strong a hold on the sympathies of all readers of south sea voyages . the journals of its first visitors , containing , as they did , such romantic descriptions of a country and people before unheard of , produced a marked sensation throughout europe ; and when the first tahitiana were carried thither , omai in london , and aotooroo in paris , were caressed by nobles , scholars , and ladies .
melville	omoo	in addition to all this , several eventful occurrences , more or less connected with tahiti , have tended to increase its celebrity . over two centuries ago , quiros , the spaniard , is supposed to have touched at the island ; and at intervals , wallis , byron , cook , de bourgainville , vancouver , le perouse , and other illustrious navigators refitted their vessels in its harbours . here the famous transit of venus was observed , in 1769 . here the memorable mutiny of the bounty afterwards had its origin . it was to the pagans of tahiti that the first regularly constituted protestant missionaries were sent ; and from their shores also , have sailed successive missions to the neighbouring islands .
melville	omoo	these , with other events which might be mentioned , have united in keeping up the first interest which the place awakened ; and the recent proceedings of the french have more than ever called forth the sympathies of the public .
melville	omoo	chapter xix . a surprise—more about bembo the sight of the island was right welcome . going into harbour after a cruise is always joyous enough , and the sailor is apt to indulge in all sorts of pleasant anticipations . but to us , the occasion was heightened by many things peculiar to our situation .
melville	omoo	since steering for the land , our prospects had been much talked over . by many it was supposed that , should the captain leave the ship , the crew were no longer bound by her articles . this was the opinion of our forecastle cokes ; though , probably , it would not have been sanctioned by the marine courts of law . at any rate , such was the state of both vessel and crew that , whatever might be the event , a long stay , and many holidays in tahiti , were confidently predicted .
melville	omoo	everybody was in high spirits . the sick , who had been improving day by day since the change in our destination , were on deck , and leaning over the bulwarks ; some all animation , and others silently admiring an object unrivalled for its stately beauty—tahiti from the sea .
melville	omoo	the quarter-deck , however , furnished a marked contrast to what was going on at the other end of the ship . the mowree was there , as usual , scowling by himself ; and jermin walked to and fro in deep thought , every now and then looking to windward , or darting into the cabin and quickly returning .
melville	omoo	with all our light sails wooingly spread , we held on our way , until , with the doctor ’ s glass , papeetee , the village metropolis of tahiti , came into view . several ships were descried lying in the harbour , and among them , one which loomed up black and large ; her two rows of teeth proclaiming a frigate . this was the reine blanche , last from the marquesas , and carrying at the fore the flag of rear-admiral du petit thouars . hardly had we made her out , when the booming of her guns came over the water . she was firing a salute , which afterwards turned out to be in honour of a treaty ; or rather—as far as the natives were concerned—a forced cession of tahiti to the french , that morning concluded .
melville	omoo	the cannonading had hardly died away , when jermin ’ s voice was heard giving an order so unexpected that everyone started . “ stand by to haul back the main-yard ! ” “ what ’ s that mean ? ” shouted the men , “ are we not going into port ? ”
melville	omoo	“ tumble after here , and no words ! ” cried the mate ; and in a moment the main-yard swung round , when , with her jib-boom pointing out to sea , the julia lay as quiet as a duck . we all looked blank—what was to come next ?
melville	omoo	presently the steward made his appearance , carrying a mattress , which he spread out in the stern-sheets of the captain ’ s boat ; two or three chests , and other things belonging to his master , were similarly disposed of .
melville	omoo	this was enough . a slight hint suffices for a sailor . still adhering to his resolution to keep the ship at sea in spite of everything , the captain , doubtless , intended to set himself ashore , leaving the vessel , under the mate , to resume her voyage at once ; but after a certain period agreed upon , to touch at the island , and take him off . all this , of course , could easily be done without approaching any nearer the land with the julia than we now were . invalid whaling captains often adopt a plan like this ; but , in the present instance , it was wholly unwarranted ; and , everything considered , at war with the commonest principles of prudence and humanity . and , although , on guy ’ s part , this resolution showed more hardihood than he had ever been given credit for , it , at the same time , argued an unaccountable simplicity , in supposing that such a crew would , in any way , submit to the outrage .
melville	omoo	it was soon made plain that we were right in our suspicions ; and the men became furious . the cooper and carpenter volunteered to head a mutiny forthwith ; and while jermin was below , four or five rushed aft to fasten down the cabin scuttle ; others , throwing down the main-braces , called out to the rest to lend a hand , and fill away for the land . all this was done in an instant ; and things were looking critical , when doctor long ghost and myself prevailed upon them to wait a while , and do nothing hastily ; there was plenty of time , and the ship was completely in our power .
melville	omoo	while the preparations were still going on in the cabin , we mustered the men together , and went into counsel upon the forecastle . it was with much difficulty that we could bring these rash spirits to a calm consideration of the case . but the doctor ’ s influence at last began to tell ; and , with a few exceptions , they agreed to be guided by him ; assured that , if they did so , the ship would eventually be brought to her anchors without anyone getting into trouble . still they told us , up and down , that if peaceable means failed , they would seize little jule , and carry her into papeetee , if they all swung for it ; but , for the present , the captain should have his own way .
melville	omoo	by this time everything was ready ; the boat was lowered and brought to the gangway ; and the captain was helped on deck by the mate and steward . it was the first time we had seen him in more than two weeks , and he was greatly altered . as if anxious to elude every eye , a broad-brimmed payata hat was pulled down over his brow ; so that his face was only visible when the brim flapped aside . by a sling , rigged from the main-yard , the cook and bembo now assisted in lowering him into the boat . as he went moaning over the side , he must have heard the whispered maledictions of his crew .
melville	omoo	while the steward was busy adjusting matters in the boat , the mate , after a private interview with the mowree , turned round abruptly , and told us that he was going ashore with the captain , to return as soon as possible . in his absence , bembo , as next in rank , would command ; there being nothing to do but keep the ship at a safe distance from the land . he then sprang into the boat , and , with only the cook and steward as oarsmen , steered for the shore .
melville	omoo	guy ’ s thus leaving the ship in the men ’ s hands , contrary to the mate ’ s advice , was another evidence of his simplicity ; for at this particular juncture , had neither the doctor nor myself been aboard , there is no telling what they might have done .
melville	omoo	for the nonce , bembo was captain ; and , so far as mere seamanship was concerned , he was as competent to command as anyone . in truth , a better seaman never swore . this accomplishment , by the bye , together with a surprising familiarity with most nautical names and phrases , comprised about all the english he knew .
melville	omoo	being a harpooner , and , as such , having access to the cabin , this man , though not yet civilized , was , according to sea usages , which know no exceptions , held superior to the sailors ; and therefore nothing was said against his being left in charge of the ship ; nor did it occasion any surprise .
melville	omoo	some additional account must be given of bembo . in the first place , he was far from being liked . a dark , moody savage , everybody but the mate more or less distrusted or feared him . nor were these feelings unreciprocated . unless duty called , he seldom went among the crew . hard stories too were told about him ; something , in particular , concerning an hereditary propensity to kill men and eat them . true , he came from a race of cannibals ; but that was all that was known to a certainty .
melville	omoo	whatever unpleasant ideas were connected with the mowree , his personal appearance no way lessened them . unlike most of his countrymen , he was , if anything , below the ordinary height ; but then , he was all compact , and under his swart , tattooed skin , the muscles worked like steel rods . hair , crisp and coal-black , curled over shaggy brows , and ambushed small , intense eyes , always on the glare . in short , he was none of your effeminate barbarians .
melville	omoo	previous to this , he had been two or three voyages in sydney whalemen ; always , however , as in the present instance , shipping at the bay of islands , and receiving his discharge there on the homeward-bound passage . in this way , his countrymen frequently enter on board the colonial whaling vessels .
melville	omoo	there was a man among us who had sailed with the mowree on his first voyage , and he told me that he had not changed a particle since then . some queer things this fellow told me . the following is one of his stories . i give it for what it is worth ; premising , however , that from what i know of bembo , and the foolhardy , dare-devil feats sometimes performed in the sperm-whale fishery , i believe in its substantial truth .
melville	omoo	as may be believed , bembo was a wild one after a fish ; indeed , all new zealanders engaged in this business are ; it seems to harmonize sweetly with their blood-thirsty propensities . at sea , the best english they speak is the south seaman ’ s slogan in lowering away , “ a dead whale , or a stove boat ! ” game to the marrow , these fellows are generally selected for harpooners ; a post in which a nervous , timid man would be rather out of his element .
melville	omoo	in darting , the harpooner , of course , stands erect in the head of the boat , one knee braced against a support . but bembo disdained this ; and was always pulled up to his fish , balancing himself right on the gunwale .
melville	omoo	but to my story . one morning , at daybreak , they brought him up to a large , long whale . he darted his harpoon , and missed ; and the fish sounded . after a while , the monster rose again , about a mile off , and they made after him . but he was frightened , or “ gallied , ” as they call it ; and noon came , and the boat was still chasing him . in whaling , as long as the fish is in sight , and no matter what may have been previously undergone , there is no giving up , except when night comes ; and nowadays , when whales are so hard to be got , frequently not even then . at last , bembo ’ s whale was alongside for the second time . he darted both harpoons ; but , as sometimes happens to the best men , by some unaccountable chance , once more missed . though it is well known that such failures will happen at times , they , nevertheless , occasion the bitterest disappointment to a boat ’ s crew , generally expressed in curses both loud and deep . and no wonder . let any man pull with might and main for hours and hours together , under a burning sun ; and if it do not make him a little peevish , he is no sailor .
melville	omoo	the taunts of the seamen may have maddened the mowree ; however it was , no sooner was he brought up again , than , harpoon in hand , he bounded upon the whale ’ s back , and for one dizzy second was seen there . the next , all was foam and fury , and both were out of sight . the men sheered off , flinging overboard the line as fast as they could ; while ahead , nothing was seen but a red whirlpool of blood and brine .
melville	omoo	presently , a dark object swam out ; the line began to straighten ; then smoked round the loggerhead , and , quick as thought , the boat sped like an arrow through the water . they were “ fast , ” and the whale was running .
melville	omoo	where was the mowree ? his brown hand was on the boat ’ s gunwale ; and he was hauled aboard in the very midst of the mad bubbles that burst under the bows .
melville	omoo	such a man , or devil , if you will , was bembo . chapter xx . the round robin—visitors from shore after the captain left , the land-breeze died away ; and , as is usual about these islands , toward noon it fell a dead calm . there was nothing to do but haul up the courses , run down the jib , and lay and roll upon the swells . the repose of the elements seemed to communicate itself to the men ; and for a time there was a lull .
melville	omoo	early in the afternoon , the mate , having left the captain at papeetee , returned to the ship . according to the steward , they were to go ashore again right after dinner with the remainder of guy ’ s effects .
melville	omoo	on gaining the deck , jermin purposely avoided us and went below without saying a word . meanwhile , long ghost and i laboured hard to diffuse the right spirit among the crew ; impressing upon them that a little patience and management would , in the end , accomplish all that their violence could ; and that , too , without making a serious matter of it .
melville	omoo	for my own part , i felt that i was under a foreign flag ; that an english consul was close at hand , and that sailors seldom obtain justice . it was best to be prudent . still , so much did i sympathize with the men , so far , at least , as their real grievances were concerned ; and so convinced was i of the cruelty and injustice of what captain guy seemed bent upon , that if need were , i stood ready to raise a hand .
melville	omoo	in spite of all we could do , some of them again became most refractory , breathing nothing but downright mutiny . when we went below to dinner these fellows stirred up such a prodigious tumult that the old hull fairly echoed . many , and fierce too , were the speeches delivered , and uproarious the comments of the sailors . among others long jim , or—as the doctor afterwards called him—lacedaemonian jim , rose in his place , and addressed the forecastle parliament in the following strain :
melville	omoo	“ look ye , britons ! if after what ’ s happened , this here craft goes to sea with us , we are no men ; and that ’ s the way to say it . speak the word , my livelies , and i ’ ll pilot her in . i ’ ve been to tahiti before and i can do it. ” whereupon , he sat down amid a universal pounding of chest-lids , and cymbaling of tin pans ; the few invalids , who , as yet , had not been actively engaged with the rest , now taking part in the applause , creaking their bunk-boards and swinging their hammocks . cries also were heard , of “ handspikes and a shindy ! ” “ out stun-sails ! ” “ hurrah ! ”
melville	omoo	several now ran on deck , and , for the moment , i thought it was all over with us ; but we finally succeeded in restoring some degree of quiet . at last , by way of diverting their thoughts , i proposed that a “ round robin ” should be prepared and sent ashore to the consul by baltimore , the cook . the idea took mightily , and i was told to set about it at once . on turning to the doctor for the requisite materials , he told me he had none ; there was not a fly-leaf , even in any of his books . so , after great search , a damp , musty volume , entitled “ a history of the most atrocious and bloody piracies , ” was produced , and its two remaining blank leaves being torn out , were by help of a little pitch lengthened into one sheet . for ink , some of the soot over the lamp was then mixed with water , by a fellow of a literary turn ; and an immense quill , plucked from a distended albatross ’ wing , which , nailed against the bowsprit bitts , had long formed an ornament of the forecastle , supplied a pen .
melville	omoo	making use of the stationery thus provided , i indited , upon a chest-lid , a concise statement of our grievances ; concluding with the earnest hope that the consul would at once come off , and see how matters stood for himself . eight beneath the note was described the circle about which the names were to be written ; the great object of a round robin being to arrange the signatures in such a way that , although they are all found in a ring , no man can be picked out as the leader of it .
melville	omoo	few among them had any regular names ; many answering to some familiar title , expressive of a personal trait ; or oftener still , to the name of the place from which they hailed ; and in one or two cases were known by a handy syllable or two , significant of nothing in particular but the men who bore them . some , to be sure , had , for the sake of formality , shipped under a feigned cognomen , or “ purser ’ s name ” ; these , however , were almost forgotten by themselves ; and so , to give the document an air of genuineness , it was decided that every man ’ s name should be put down as it went among the crew .
melville	omoo	it is due to the doctor to say that the circumscribed device was his . folded , and sealed with a drop of tar , the round robin was directed to “ the english consul , tahiti ” ; and , handed to the cook , was by him delivered into that gentleman ’ s hands as soon as the mate went ashore .
melville	omoo	on the return of the boat , sometime after dark , we learned a good deal from old baltimore , who , having been allowed to run about as much as he pleased , had spent his time gossiping .
melville	omoo	owing to the proceedings of the french , everything in tahiti was in an uproar . pritchard , the missionary consul , was absent in england ; but his place was temporarily filled by one wilson , an educated white man , born on the island , and the son of an old missionary of that name still living .
melville	omoo	with natives and foreigners alike , wilson the younger was exceedingly unpopular , being held an unprincipled and dissipated man , a character verified by his subsequent conduct . pritchard ’ s selecting a man like this to attend to the duties of his office , had occasioned general dissatisfaction ashore .
melville	omoo	though never in europe or america , the acting consul had been several voyages to sydney in a schooner belonging to the mission ; and therefore our surprise was lessened , when baltimore told us , that he and captain guy were as sociable as could be—old acquaintances , in fact ; and that the latter had taken up his quarters at wilson ’ s house . for us this boded ill .
melville	omoo	the mate was now assailed by a hundred questions as to what was going to be done with us . his only reply was , that in the morning the consul would pay us a visit , and settle everything .
melville	omoo	after holding our ground off the harbour during the night , in the morning a shore boat , manned by natives , was seen coming off . in it were wilson and another white man , who proved to be a doctor johnson , an englishman , and a resident physician of papeetee .
melville	omoo	stopping our headway as they approached , jermin advanced to the gangway to receive them . no sooner did the consul touch the deck , than he gave us a specimen of what he was .
melville	omoo	“ mr . jermin , ” he cried loftily , and not deigning to notice the respectful salutation of the person addressed , “ mr . jermin , tack ship , and stand off from the land. ” upon this , the men looked hard at him , anxious to see what sort of a looking “ cove ” he was . upon inspection , he turned out to be an exceedingly minute “ cove , ” with a viciously pugged nose , and a decidedly thin pair of legs . there was nothing else noticeable about him . jermin , with ill-assumed suavity , at once obeyed the order , and the ship ’ s head soon pointed out to sea .
melville	omoo	now , contempt is as frequently produced at first sight as love ; and thus was it with respect to wilson . no one could look at him without conceiving a strong dislike , or a cordial desire to entertain such a feeling the first favourable opportunity . there was such an intolerable air of conceit about this man that it was almost as much as one could do to refrain from running up and affronting him .
melville	omoo	“ so the counsellor is come , ” exclaimed navy bob , who , like all the rest , invariably styled him thus , much to mine and the doctor ’ s diversion . “ ay , ” said another , “ and for no good , i ’ ll be bound . ”
melville	omoo	such were some of the observations made , as wilson and the mate went below conversing . but no one exceeded the cooper in the violence with which he inveighed against the ship and everything connected with her . swearing like a trooper , he called the main-mast to witness that , if he ( bungs ) ever again went out of sight of land in the julia , he prayed heaven that a fate might be his—altogether too remarkable to be here related .
melville	omoo	much had he to say also concerning the vileness of what we had to eat—not fit for a dog ; besides enlarging upon the imprudence of intrusting the vessel longer to a man of the mate ’ s intemperate habits . with so many sick , too , what could we expect to do in the fishery ? it was no use talking ; come what come might , the ship must let go her anchor .
melville	omoo	now , as bungs , besides being an able seaman , a “ cod ” in the forecastle , and about the oldest man in it , was , moreover , thus deeply imbued with feelings so warmly responded to by the rest , he was all at once selected to officiate as spokesman , as soon as the consul should see fit to address us . the selection was made contrary to mine and the doctor ’ s advice ; however , all assured us they would keep quiet , and hear everything wilson had to say , before doing anything decisive .
melville	omoo	we were not kept long in suspense ; for very soon he was seen standing in the cabin gangway , with the tarnished tin case containing the ship ’ s papers ; and jennin at once sung out for the ship ’ s company to muster on the quarter-deck .
melville	omoo	chapter xxi . proceedings of the consul the order was instantly obeyed , and the sailors ranged themselves , facing the consul . they were a wild company ; men of many climes—not at all precise in their toilet arrangements , but picturesque in their very tatters . my friend , the long doctor , was there too ; and with a view , perhaps , of enlisting the sympathies of the consul for a gentleman in distress , had taken more than ordinary pains with his appearance . but among the sailors , he looked like a land-crane blown off to sea , and consorting with petrels .
melville	omoo	the forlorn rope yarn , however , was by far the most remarkable figure . land-lubber that he was , his outfit of sea-clothing had long since been confiscated ; and he was now fain to go about in whatever he could pick up . his upper garment—an unsailor-like article of dress which he persisted in wearing , though torn from his back twenty times in the day—was an old “ claw-hammer jacket , ” or swallow-tail coat , formerly belonging to captain guy , and which had formed one of his perquisites when steward .
melville	omoo	by the side of wilson was the mate , bareheaded , his gray locks lying in rings upon his bronzed brow , and his keen eye scanning the crowd as if he knew their every thought . his frock hung loosely , exposing his round throat , mossy chest , and short and nervous arm embossed with pugilistic bruises , and quaint with many a device in india ink .
melville	omoo	in the midst of a portentous silence , the consul unrolled his papers , evidently intending to produce an effect by the exceeding bigness of his looks . “ mr . jermin , call off their names ; ” and he handed him a list of the ship ’ s company .
melville	omoo	all answered but the deserters and the two mariners at the bottom of the sea . it was now supposed that the round robin would be produced , and something said about it . but not so . among the consul ’ s papers that unique document was thought to be perceived ; but , if there , it was too much despised to be made a subject of comment . some present , very justly regarding it as an uncommon literary production , had been anticipating all sorts of miracles therefrom ; and were , therefore , much touched at this neglect .
melville	omoo	“ well , men , ” began wilson again after a short pause , “ although you all look hearty enough , i ’ m told there are some sick among you . now then , mr. jermin , call off the names on that sick-list of yours , and let them go over to the other side of the deck—i should like to see who they are . ”
melville	omoo	“ so , then , ” said he , after we had all passed over , “ you are the sick fellows , are you ? very good : i shall have you seen to . you will go down into the cabin one by one , to doctor johnson , who will report your respective cases to me . such as he pronounces in a dying state i shall have sent ashore ; the rest will be provided with everything needful , and remain aboard . ”
melville	omoo	at this announcement , we gazed strangely at each other , anxious to see who it was that looked like dying , and pretty nearly deciding to stay aboard and get well , rather than go ashore and be buried . there were some , nevertheless , who saw very plainly what wilson was at , and they acted accordingly . for my own part , i resolved to assume as dying an expression as possible ; hoping that , on the strength of it , i might be sent ashore , and so get rid of the ship without any further trouble .
melville	omoo	with this intention , i determined to take no part in anything that might happen until my case was decided upon . as for the doctor , he had all along pretended to be more or less unwell ; and by a significant look now given me , it was plain that he was becoming decidedly worse .
melville	omoo	the invalids disposed of for the present , and one of them having gone below to be examined , the consul turned round to the rest , and addressed them as follows : — “ men , i ’ m going to ask you two or three questions—let one of you answer yes or no , and the rest keep silent . now then : have you anything to say against your mate , mr. jermin ? ” and he looked sharply among the sailors , and , at last , right into the eye of the cooper , whom everybody was eyeing .
melville	omoo	“ well , sir , ” faltered bungs , “ we can ’ t say anything against mr. jermin ’ s seamanship , but— ” “ i want no buts , ” cried the consul , breaking in : “ answer me yes or no—have you anything to say against mr. jermin ? ”
melville	omoo	“ i was going on to say , sir ; mr. jermin ’ s a very good man ; but then— ” here the mate looked marlinespikes at bungs ; and bungs , after stammering out something , looked straight down to a seam in the deck , and stopped short .
melville	omoo	a rather assuming fellow heretofore , the cooper had sported many feathers in his cap ; he was now showing the white one . “ so much then for that part of the business , ” exclaimed wilson , smartly ; “ you have nothing to say against him , i see . ”
melville	omoo	upon this , several seemed to be on the point of saying a good deal ; but disconcerted by the cooper ’ s conduct , checked themselves , and the consul proceeded . “ have you enough to eat , aboard ? answer me , you man who spoke before . ”
melville	omoo	“ well , i don ’ t know as to that , ” said the cooper , looking excessively uneasy , and trying to edge back , but pushed forward again . “ some of that salt horse ain ’ t as sweet as it might be . ”
melville	omoo	“ that ’ s not what i asked you , ” shouted the consul , growing brave quite fast ; “ answer my questions as i put them , or i ’ ll find a way to make you. ” this was going a little too far . the ferment , into which the cooper ’ s poltroonery had thrown the sailors , now brooked no restraint ; and one of them—a young american who went by the name of salem—dashed out from among the rest , and fetching the cooper a blow that sent him humming over toward the consul , flourished a naked sheath-knife in the air , and burst forth with “ i ’ m the little fellow that can answer your questions ; just put them to me once , counsellor. ” but the “ counsellor ” had no more questions to ask just then ; for at the alarming apparition of salem ’ s knife , and the extraordinary effect produced upon bungs , he had popped his head down the companion-way , and was holding it there .
melville	omoo	upon the mate ’ s assuring him , however , that it was all over , he looked up , quite flustered , if not frightened , but evidently determined to put as fierce a face on the matter as practicable . speaking sharply , he warned all present to “ look out ” ; and then repeated the question , whether there was enough to eat aboard . everyone now turned spokesman ; and he was assailed by a perfect hurricane of yells , in which the oaths fell like hailstones .
melville	omoo	“ how ’ s this ! what d ’ ye mean ? ” he cried , upon the first lull ; “ who told you all to speak at once ? here , you man with the knife , you ’ ll be putting someone ’ s eyes out yet ; d ’ ye hear , you sir ? you seem to have a good deal to say , who are you , pray ; where did you ship ? ”
melville	omoo	“ i ’ m nothing more nor a bloody beach-comber , ” retorted salem , stepping forward piratically and eyeing him ; “ and if you want to know , i shipped at the islands about four months ago . ”
melville	omoo	“ only four months ago ? and here you have more to say than men who have been aboard the whole voyage ; ” and the consul made a dash at looking furious , but failed . “ let me hear no more from you , sir . where ’ s that respectable , gray-headed man , the cooper ? he ’ s the one to answer my questions . ”
melville	omoo	“ there ’ s no ’ spectable , gray-headed men aboard , ” returned salem ; “ we ’ re all a parcel of mutineers and pirates ! ” all this time , the mate was holding his peace ; and wilson , now completely abashed , and at a loss what to do , took him by the arm , and walked across the deck . returning to the cabin-scuttle , after a close conversation , he abruptly addressed the sailors , without taking any further notice of what had just happened .
melville	omoo	“ for reasons you all know , men , this ship has been placed in my hands . as captain guy will remain ashore for the present , your mate , mr. jermin , will command until his recovery . according to my judgment , there is no reason why the voyage should not be at once resumed ; especially , as i shall see that you have two more harpooners , and enough good men to man three boats . as for the sick , neither you nor i have anything to do with them ; they will be attended to by doctor johnson ; but i ’ ve explained that matter before . as soon as things can be arranged—in a day or two , at farthest—you will go to sea for a three months ’ cruise , touching here , at the end of it , for your captain . let me hear a good report of you , now , when you come back . at present , you will continue lying off and on the harbour . i will send you fresh provisions as soon as i can get them . there : i ’ ve nothing more to say ; go forward to your stations . ”
melville	omoo	and , without another word , he wheeled round to descend into the cabin . but hardly had he concluded before the incensed men were dancing about him on every side , and calling upon him to lend an ear . each one for himself denied the legality of what he proposed to do ; insisted upon the necessity for taking the ship in ; and finally gave him to understand , roughly and roundly , that go to sea in her they would not .
melville	omoo	in the midst of this mutinous uproar , the alarmed consul stood fast by the scuttle . his tactics had been decided upon beforehand ; indeed , they must have been concerted ashore , between him and the captain ; for all he said , as he now hurried below , was , “ go forward , men ; i ’ m through with you : you should have mentioned these matters before : my arrangements are concluded : go forward , i say ; i ’ ve nothing more to say to you. ” and , drawing over the slide of the scuttle , he disappeared . upon the very point of following him down , the attention of the exasperated seamen was called off to a party who had just then taken the recreant bungs in hand . amid a shower of kicks and cuffs , the traitor was borne along to the forecastle , where—i forbear to relate what followed .
melville	omoo	chapter xxii . the consul ’ s departure during the scenes just described , doctor johnson was engaged in examining the sick , of whom , as it turned out , all but two were to remain in the ship . he had evidently received his cue from wilson .
melville	omoo	one of the last called below into the cabin , just as the quarter-deck gathering dispersed , i came on deck quite incensed . my lameness , which , to tell the truth , was now much better , was put down as , in a great measure , affected ; and my name was on the list of those who would be fit for any duty in a day or two . this was enough . as for doctor long ghost , the shore physician , instead of extending to him any professional sympathy , had treated him very cavalierly . to a certain extent , therefore , we were now both bent on making common cause with the sailors .
melville	omoo	i must explain myself here . all we wanted was to have the ship snugly anchored in papeetee bay ; entertaining no doubt that , could this be done , it would in some way or other peaceably lead to our emancipation . without a downright mutiny , there was but one way to accomplish this : to induce the men to refuse all further duty , unless it were to work the vessel in . the only difficulty lay in restraining them within proper bounds . nor was it without certain misgivings , that i found myself so situated , that i must necessarily link myself , however guardedly , with such a desperate company ; and in an enterprise , too , of which it was hard to conjecture what might be the result . but anything like neutrality was out of the question ; and unconditional submission was equally so .
melville	omoo	on going forward , we found them ten times more tumultuous than ever . after again restoring some degree of tranquillity , we once more urged our plan of quietly refusing duty , and awaiting the result . at first , few would hear of it ; but in the end , a good number were convinced by our representations . others held out . nor were those who thought with us in all things to be controlled .
melville	omoo	upon wilson ’ s coming on deck to enter his boat , he was beset on all sides ; and , for a moment , i thought the ship would be seized before his very eyes .
melville	omoo	“ nothing more to say to you , men : my arrangements are made . go forward , where you belong . i ’ ll take no insolence ; ” and , in a tremor , wilson hurried over the side in the midst of a volley of execrations .
melville	omoo	shortly after his departure , the mate ordered the cook and steward into his boat ; and saying that he was going to see how the captain did , left us , as before , under the charge of bembo .
melville	omoo	at this time we were lying becalmed , pretty close in with the land ( having gone about again ) , our main-topsail flapping against the mast with every roll . the departure of the consul and jermin was followed by a scene absolutely indescribable . the sailors ran about deck like madmen ; bembo , all the while leaning against the taff-rail by himself , smoking his heathenish stone pipe , and never interfering .
melville	omoo	the cooper , who that morning had got himself into a fluid of an exceedingly high temperature , now did his best to regain the favour of the crew . “ without distinction of party , ” he called upon all hands to step up , and partake of the contents of his bucket .
melville	omoo	but it was quite plain that , before offering to intoxicate others , he had taken the wise precaution of getting well tipsy himself . he was now once more happy in the affection of his shipmates , who , one and all , pronounced him sound to the kelson .
melville	omoo	the pisco soon told ; and , with great difficulty , we restrained a party in the very act of breaking into the after-hold in pursuit of more . all manner of pranks were now played .
melville	omoo	“ mast-head , there ! what d ’ ye see ? ” bawled beauty , hailing the main-truck through an enormous copper funnel . “ stand by for stays , ” roared flash jack , bawling off with the cook ’ s axe , at the fastening of the main-stay . “ looky out for ’ quails ! ” shrieked the portuguese , antone , darting a handspike through the cabin skylight . and “ heave round cheerly , men , ” sung out navy bob , dancing a hornpipe on the forecastle .
melville	omoo	chapter xxiii . the second night off papeetee toward sunset , the mate came off , singing merrily , in the stern of his boat ; and in attempting to climb up the side , succeeded in going plump into the water . he was rescued by the steward , and carried across the deck with many moving expressions of love for his bearer . tumbled into the quarter-boat , he soon fell asleep , and waking about midnight , somewhat sobered , went forward among the men . here , to prepare for what follows , we must leave him for a moment .
melville	omoo	it was now plain enough that jermin was by no means unwilling to take the julia to sea ; indeed , there was nothing he so much desired ; though what his reasons were , seeing our situation , we could only conjecture . nevertheless , so it was ; and having counted much upon his rough popularity with the men to reconcile them to a short cruise under him , he had consequently been disappointed in their behaviour . still , thinking that they would take a different view of the matter , when they came to know what fine times he had in store for them , he resolved upon trying a little persuasion .
melville	omoo	so on going forward , he put his head down the forecastle scuttle , and hailed us quite cordially , inviting us down into the cabin ; where , he said , he had something to make merry withal . nothing loth , we went ; and throwing ourselves along the transom , waited for the steward to serve us .
melville	omoo	as the can circulated , jermin , leaning on the table and occupying the captain ’ s arm-chair secured to the deck , opened his mind as bluntly and freely as ever . he was by no means yet sober .
melville	omoo	he told us we were acting very foolishly ; that if we only stuck to the ship , he would lead us all a jovial life of it ; enumerating the casks still remaining untapped in the julia ’ s wooden cellar . it was even hinted vaguely that such a thing might happen as our not coming back for the captain ; whom he spoke of but lightly ; asserting , what he had often said before , that he was no sailor .
melville	omoo	moreover , and perhaps with special reference to doctor long ghost and myself , he assured us generally that , if there were any among us studiously inclined , he would take great pleasure in teaching such the whole art and mystery of navigation , including the gratuitous use of his quadrant .
melville	omoo	i should have mentioned that , previous to this , he had taken the doctor aside , and said something about reinstating him in the cabin with augmented dignity ; beside throwing out a hint that i myself was in some way or other to be promoted . but it was all to no purpose ; bent the men were upon going ashore , and there was no moving them .
melville	omoo	at last he flew into a rage—much increased by the frequency of his potations—and with many imprecations , concluded by driving everybody out of the cabin . we tumbled up the gangway in high good-humour .
melville	omoo	upon deck everything looked so quiet that some of the most pugnacious spirits actually lamented that there was so little prospect of an exhilarating disturbance before morning . it was not five minutes , however , ere these fellows were gratified .
melville	omoo	sydney ben—said to be a runaway ticket-of-leave-man , and for reasons of his own , one of the few who still remained on duty—had , for the sake of the fun , gone down with the rest into the cabin ; where bembo , who meanwhile was left in charge of the deck , had frequently called out for him . at first , ben pretended not to hear ; but on being sung out for again and again , bluntly refused ; at the same time , casting some illiberal reflections on the mowree ’ s maternal origin , which the latter had been long enough among the sailors to understand as in the highest degree offensive . so just after the men came up from below , bembo singled him out , and gave him such a cursing in his broken lingo that it was enough to frighten one . the convict was the worse for liquor ; indeed the mowree had been tippling also , and before we knew it , a blow was struck by ben , and the two men came together like magnets .
melville	omoo	the ticket-of-leave-man was a practised bruiser ; but the savage knew nothing of the art pugilistic : and so they were even . it was clear hugging and wrenching till both came to the deck . here they rolled over and over in the middle of a ring which seemed to form of itself . at last the white man ’ s head fell back , and his face grew purple . bembo ’ s teeth were at his throat . rushing in all round , they hauled the savage off , but not until repeatedly struck on the head would he let go .
melville	omoo	his rage was now absolutely demoniac ; he lay glaring and writhing on the deck , without attempting to rise . cowed , as they supposed he was , from his attitude , the men , rejoiced at seeing him thus humbled , left him ; after rating him , in sailor style , for a cannibal and a coward .
melville	omoo	ben was attended to , and led below . soon after this , the rest also , with but few exceptions , retired into the forecastle ; and having been up nearly all the previous night , they quickly dropped about the chests and rolled into the hammocks . in an hour ’ s time , not a sound could be heard in that part of the ship .
melville	omoo	before bembo was dragged away , the mate had in vain endeavoured to separate the combatants , repeatedly striking the mowree ; but the seamen interposing , at last kept him off . and intoxicated as he was , when they dispersed , he knew enough to charge the steward—a steady seaman be it remembered—with the present safety of the ship ; and then went below , when he fell directly into another drunken sleep .
melville	omoo	having remained upon deck with the doctor some time after the rest had gone below , i was just on the point of following him down , when i saw the mowree rise , draw a bucket of water , and holding it high above his head , pour its contents right over him . this he repeated several times . there was nothing very peculiar in the act , but something else about him struck me . however , i thought no more of it , but descended the scuttle .
melville	omoo	after a restless nap , i found the atmosphere of the forecastle so close , from nearly all the men being down at the same time , that i hunted up an old pea-jacket and went on deck ; intending to sleep it out there till morning . here i found the cook and steward , wymontoo , rope yarn , and the dane ; who , being all quiet , manageable fellows , and holding aloof from the rest since the captain ’ s departure , had been ordered by the mate not to go below until sunrise . they were lying under the lee of the bulwarks ; two or three fast asleep , and the others smoking their pipes , and conversing .
melville	omoo	to my surprise , bembo was at the helm ; but there being so few to stand there now , they told me , he had offered to take his turn with the rest , at the same time heading the watch ; and to this , of course , they made no objection .
melville	omoo	it was a fine , bright night ; all moon and stars , and white crests of waves . the breeze was light , but freshening ; and close-hauled , poor little jule , as if nothing had happened , was heading in for the land , which rose high and hazy in the distance .
melville	omoo	after the day ’ s uproar , the tranquillity of the scene was soothing , and i leaned over the side to enjoy it . more than ever did i now lament my situation—but it was useless to repine , and i could not upbraid myself . so at last , becoming drowsy , i made a bed with my jacket under the windlass , and tried to forget myself .
melville	omoo	how long i lay there , i can not tell ; but as i rose , the first object that met my eye was bembo at the helm ; his dark figure slowly rising and falling with the ship ’ s motion against the spangled heavens behind . he seemed all impatience and expectation ; standing at arm ’ s length from the spokes , with one foot advanced , and his bare head thrust forward . where i was , the watch were out of sight ; and no one else was stirring ; the deserted decks and broad white sails were gleaming in the moonlight .
melville	omoo	presently , a swelling , dashing sound came upon my ear , and i had a sort of vague consciousness that i had been hearing it before . the next instant i was broad awake and on my feet . eight ahead , and so near that my heart stood still , was a long line of breakers , heaving and frothing . it was the coral reef girdling the island . behind it , and almost casting their shadows upon the deck , were the sleeping mountains , about whose hazy peaks the gray dawn was just breaking . the breeze had freshened , and with a steady , gliding motion , we were running straight for the reef .
melville	omoo	all was taken in at a glance ; the fell purpose of bembo was obvious , and with a frenzied shout to wake the watch , i rushed aft . they sprang to their feet bewildered ; and after a short , but desperate scuffle , we tore him from the helm . in wrestling with him , the wheel—left for a moment unguarded—flew to leeward , thus , fortunately , bringing the ship ’ s head to the wind , and so retarding her progress . previous to this , she had been kept three or four points free , so as to close with the breakers . her headway now shortened , i steadied the helm , keeping the sails just lifting , while we glided obliquely toward the land . to have run off before the wind—an easy thing—would have been almost instant destruction , owing to a curve of the reef in that direction . at this time , the dane and the steward were still struggling with the furious mowree , and the others were running about irresolute and shouting .
melville	omoo	but darting forward the instant i had the helm , the old cook thundered on the forecastle with a handspike , “ breakers ! breakers close aboard ! — ’ bout ship ! ’ bout ship ! ” up came the sailors , staring about them in stupid horror .
melville	omoo	“ haul back the head-yards ! ” “ let go the lee fore-brace ! ” “ ready about ! about ! ” were now shouted on all sides ; while distracted by a thousand orders , they ran hither and thither , fairly panic-stricken .
melville	omoo	it seemed all over with us ; and i was just upon the point of throwing the ship full into the wind ( a step , which , saving us for the instant , would have sealed our fate in the end ) , when a sharp cry shot by my ear like the flight of an arrow .
melville	omoo	it was salem : “ all ready for ’ ard ; hard down ! ” round and round went the spokes—the julia , with her short keel , spinning to windward like a top . soon , the jib-sheets lashed the stays , and the men , more self-possessed , flew to the braces .
melville	omoo	“ main-sail haul ! ” was now heard , as the fresh breeze streamed fore and aft the deck ; and directly the after-yards were whirled round . in a half-a-minute more , we were sailing away from the land on the other tack , with every sail distended .
melville	omoo	turning on her heel within little more than a biscuit ’ s toss of the reef , no earthly power could have saved us , were it not that , up to the very brink of the coral rampart , there are no soundings .
melville	omoo	chapter xxiv . outbreak of the crew the purpose of bembo had been made known to the men generally by the watch ; and now that our salvation was certain , by an instinctive impulse they raised a cry , and rushed toward him .
melville	omoo	just before liberated by dunk and the steward , he was standing doggedly by the mizzen-mast ; and , as the infuriated sailors came on , his bloodshot eye rolled , and his sheath-knife glittered over his head .
melville	omoo	“ down with him ! ” “ strike him down ! ” “ hang him at the main-yard ! ” such were the shouts now raised . but he stood unmoved , and , for a single instant , they absolutely faltered . “ cowards ! ” cried salem , and he flung himself upon him . the steel descended like a ray of light ; but did no harm ; for the sailor ’ s heart was beating against the mowree ’ s before he was aware .
melville	omoo	they both fell to the deck , when the knife was instantly seized , and bembo secured . “ for ’ ard ! for ’ ard with him ! ” was again the cry ; “ give him a sea-toss ! ” “ overboard with him ! ” and he was dragged along the deck , struggling and fighting with tooth and nail .
melville	omoo	all this uproar immediately over the mate ’ s head at last roused him from his drunken nap , and he came staggering on deck . “ what ’ s this ? ” he shouted , running right in among them .
melville	omoo	“ it ’ s the mowree , zur ; they are going to murder him , zur , ” here sobbed poor rope yarn , crawling close up to him . “ avast ! avast ! ” roared jermin , making a spring toward bembo , and dashing two or three of the sailors aside . at this moment the wretch was partly flung over the bulwarks , which shook with his frantic struggles . in vain the doctor and others tried to save him : the men listened to nothing .
melville	omoo	“ murder and mutiny , by the salt sea ! ” shouted the mate ; and dashing his arms right and left , he planted his iron hand upon the mowree ’ s shoulder . “ there are two of us now ; and as you serve him , you serve me , ” he cried , turning fiercely round .
melville	omoo	“ over with them together , then , ” exclaimed the carpenter , springing forward ; but the rest fell back before the courageous front of jermin , and , with the speed of thought , bembo , unharmed , stood upon deck .
melville	omoo	“ aft with ye ! ” cried his deliverer ; and he pushed him right among the men , taking care to follow him up close . giving the sailors no time to recover , he pushed the mowree before him , till they came to the cabin scuttle , when he drew the slide over him , and stood still . throughout , bembo never spoke one word .
melville	omoo	“ now for ’ ard where ye belong ! ” cried the mate , addressing the seamen , who by this time , rallying again , had no idea of losing their victim . “ the mowree ! the mowree ! ” they shouted .
melville	omoo	here the doctor , in answer to the mate ’ s repeated questions , stepped forward , and related what bembo had been doing ; a matter which the mate but dimly understood from the violent threatenings he had been hearing .
melville	omoo	for a moment he seemed to waver ; but at last , turning the key of the padlock of the slide , he breathed through his set teeth— “ ye can ’ t have him ; i ’ ll hand him over to the consul ; so for ’ ard with ye , i say : when there ’ s any drowning to be done , i ’ ll pass the word ; so away with ye , ye blood-thirsty pirates . ”
melville	omoo	it was to no purpose that they begged or threatened : jermin , although by no means sober , stood his ground manfully , and before long they dispersed , soon to forget everything that had happened .
melville	omoo	though we had no opportunity to hear him confess it , bembo ’ s intention to destroy us was beyond all question . his only motive could have been a desire to revenge the contumely heaped upon him the night previous , operating upon a heart irreclaimably savage , and at no time fraternally disposed toward the crew .
melville	omoo	during the whole of this scene the doctor did his best to save him . but well knowing that all i could do would have been equally useless , i maintained my place at the wheel . indeed , no one but jermin could have prevented this murder .
melville	omoo	chapter xxv . jermin encounters an old shipmate during the morning of the day which dawned upon the events just recounted , we remained a little to leeward of the harbour , waiting the appearance of the consul , who had promised the mate to come off in a shore boat for the purpose of seeing him .
melville	omoo	by this time the men had forced his secret from the cooper , and the consequence was that they kept him continually coming and going from the after-hold . the mate must have known this ; but he said nothing , notwithstanding all the dancing and singing , and occasional fighting which announced the flow of the pisco .
melville	omoo	the peaceable influence which the doctor and myself had heretofore been exerting , was now very nearly at an end . confident , from the aspect of matters , that the ship , after all , would be obliged to go in ; and learning , moreover , that the mate had said so , the sailors , for the present , seemed in no hurry about it ; especially as the bucket of bungs gave such generous cheer .
melville	omoo	as for bembo , we were told that , after putting him in double irons , the mate had locked him up in the captain ’ s state-room , taking the additional precaution of keeping the cabin scuttle secured . from this time forward we never saw the mowree again , a circumstance which will explain itself as the narrative proceeds .
melville	omoo	noon came , and no consul ; and as the afternoon advanced without any word even from the shore , the mate was justly incensed ; more especially as he had taken great pains to keep perfectly sober against wilson ’ s arrival .
melville	omoo	two or three hours before sundown , a small schooner came out of the harbour , and headed over for the adjoining island of imeeo , or moreea , in plain sight , about fifteen miles distant . the wind failing , the current swept her down under our bows , where we had a fair glimpse of the natives on her decks .
melville	omoo	there were a score of them , perhaps , lounging upon spread mats , and smoking their pipes . on floating so near , and hearing the maudlin cries of our crew , and beholding their antics , they must have taken us for a pirate ; at any rate , they got out their sweeps , and pulled away as fast as they could ; the sight of our two six-pounders , which , by way of a joke , were now run out of the side-ports , giving a fresh impetus to their efforts . but they had not gone far , when a white man , with a red sash about his waist , made his appearance on deck , the natives immediately desisting .
melville	omoo	hailing us loudly , he said he was coming aboard ; and after some confusion on the schooner ’ s decks , a small canoe was launched over-board , and , in a minute or two , he was with us . he turned out to be an old shipmate of jermin ’ s , one viner , long supposed dead , but now resident on the island .
melville	omoo	the meeting of these men , under the circumstances , is one of a thousand occurrences appearing exaggerated in fiction ; but , nevertheless , frequently realized in actual lives of adventure . some fifteen years previous , they had sailed together as officers of the barque jane , of london , a south seaman . somewhere near the new hebrides , they struck one night upon an unknown reef ; and , in a few hours , the jane went to pieces . the boats , however , were saved ; some provisions also , a quadrant , and a few other articles . but several of the men were lost before they got clear of the wreck .
melville	omoo	the three boats , commanded respectively by the captain , jermin , and the third mate , then set sail for a small english settlement at the bay of islands in new zealand . of course they kept together as much as possible . after being at sea about a week , a lascar in the captain ’ s boat went crazy ; and , it being dangerous to keep him , they tried to throw him overboard . in the confusion that ensued the boat capsized from the sail ’ s “ jibing ” ; and a considerable sea running at the time , and the other boats being separated more than usual , only one man was picked up . the very next night it blew a heavy gale ; and the remaining boats taking in all sail , made bundles of their oars , flung them overboard , and rode to them with plenty of line . when morning broke , jermin and his men were alone upon the ocean : the third mate ’ s boat , in all probability , having gone down .
melville	omoo	after great hardships , the survivors caught sight of a brig , which took them on board , and eventually landed them at sydney . ever since then our mate had sailed from that port , never once hearing of his lost shipmates , whom , by this time , of course , he had long given up . judge , then , his feelings when viner , the lost third mate , the instant he touched the deck , rushed up and wrung him by the hand .
melville	omoo	during the gale his line had parted ; so that the boat , drifting fast to leeward , was out of sight by morning . reduced , after this , to great extremities , the boat touched , for fruit , at an island of which they knew nothing . the natives , at first , received them kindly ; but one of the men getting into a quarrel on account of a woman , and the rest taking his part , they were all massacred but viner , who , at the time , was in an adjoining village . after staying on the island more than two years , he finally escaped in the boat of an american whaler , which landed him at valparaiso . from this period he had continued to follow the seas , as a man before the mast , until about eighteen months previous , when he went ashore at tahiti , where he now owned the schooner we saw , in which he traded among the neighbouring islands .
melville	omoo	the breeze springing up again just after nightfall , viner left us , promising his old shipmate to see him again , three days hence , in papeetee harbour . chapter xxvi . we enter the harbour—jim the pilot
melville	omoo	exhausted by the day ’ s wassail , most of the men went below at an early hour , leaving the deck to the steward and two of the men remaining on duty ; the mate , with baltimore and the dane , engaging to relieve them at midnight . at that hour , the ship—now standing off shore , under short sail—was to be tacked .
melville	omoo	it was not long after midnight , when we were wakened in the forecastle by the lion roar of jermin ’ s voice , ordering a pull at the jib-halyards ; and soon afterwards , a handspike struck the scuttle , and all hands were called to take the ship into port .
melville	omoo	this was wholly unexpected ; but we learned directly that the mate , no longer relying upon the consul , and renouncing all thought of inducing the men to change their minds , had suddenly made up his own . he was going to beat up to the entrance of the harbour , so as to show a signal for a pilot before sunrise .
melville	omoo	notwithstanding this , the sailors absolutely refused to assist in working the ship under any circumstances whatever : to all mine and the doctor ’ s entreaties lending a deaf ear . sink or strike , they swore they would have nothing more to do with her . this perverseness was to be attributed , in a great measure , to the effects of their late debauch .
melville	omoo	with a strong breeze , all sail set , and the ship in the hands of four or five men , exhausted by two nights ’ watching , our situation was bad enough ; especially as the mate seemed more reckless than ever , and we were now to tack ship several times close under the land .
melville	omoo	well knowing that if anything untoward happened to the vessel before morning , it would be imputed to the conduct of the crew , and so lead to serious results , should they ever be brought to trial ; i called together those on deck to witness my declaration ; —that now that the julia was destined for the harbour ( the only object for which i , at least , had been struggling ) , i was willing to do what i could toward carrying her in safely . in this step i was followed by the doctor .
melville	omoo	the hours passed anxiously until morning ; when , being well to windward of the mouth of the harbour , we bore up for it , with the union-jack at the fore . no sign , however , of boat or pilot was seen ; and after running close in several times , the ensign was set at the mizzen-peak , union down in distress . but it was of no avail .
melville	omoo	attributing to wilson this unaccountable remissness on the part of those ashore , jermin , quite enraged , now determined to stand boldly in upon his own responsibility ; trusting solely to what he remembered of the harbour on a visit there many years previous .
melville	omoo	this resolution was characteristic . even with a competent pilot , papeetee bay , is considered a ticklish , one to enter . formed by a bold sweep of the shore , it is protected seaward by the coral reef , upon which the rollers break with great violence . after stretching across the bay , the barrier extends on toward point venus , in the district of matavia , eight or nine miles distant . here there is an opening , by which ships enter , and glide down the smooth , deep canal , between the reef and the shore , to the harbour . but , by seamen generally , the leeward entrance is preferred , as the wind is extremely variable inside the reef . this latter entrance is a break in the barrier directly facing the bay and village of papeetee . it is very narrow ; and from the baffling winds , currents , and sunken rocks , ships now and then grate their keels against the coral .
melville	omoo	but the mate was not to be daunted ; so , stationing what men he had at the braces , he sprang upon the bulwarks , and , bidding everybody keep wide awake , ordered the helm up . in a few moments , we were running in . being toward noon , the wind was fast leaving us , and , by the time the breakers were roaring on either hand , little more than steerage-way was left . but on we glided—smoothly and deftly ; avoiding the green , darkling objects here and there strewn in our path ; jermin occasionally looking down in the water , and then about him , with the utmost calmness , and not a word spoken . just fanned along thus , it was not many minutes ere we were past all danger , and floated into the placid basin within . this was the cleverest specimen of his seamanship that he ever gave us .
melville	omoo	as we held on toward the frigate and shipping , a canoe , coming out from among them , approached . in it were a boy and an old man—both islanders ; the former nearly naked , and the latter dressed in an old naval frock-coat . both were paddling with might and main ; the old man , once in a while , tearing his paddle out of the water ; and , after rapping his companion over the head , both fell to with fresh vigour . as they came within hail , the old fellow , springing to his feet and flourishing his paddle , cut some of the queerest capers ; all the while jabbering something which at first we could not understand .
melville	omoo	presently we made out the following : — “ ah ! you pemi , ah ! —you come ! —what for you come ? —you be fine for come no pilot.—i say , you hear ? —i say , you ita maitui ( no good ) .—you hear ? —you no pilot.—yes , you d—— me , you no pilot ’ t all ; i d—— you ; you hear ? ”
melville	omoo	this tirade , which showed plainly that , whatever the profane old rascal was at , he was in right good earnest , produced peals of laughter from the ship . upon which , he seemed to get beside himself ; and the boy , who , with suspended paddle , was staring about him , received a sound box over the head , which set him to work in a twinkling , and brought the canoe quite near . the orator now opening afresh , it turned out that his vehement rhetoric was all addressed to the mate , still standing conspicuously on the bulwarks .
melville	omoo	but jermin was in no humour for nonsense ; so , with a sailor ’ s blessing , he ordered him off . the old fellow then flew into a regular frenzy , cursing and swearing worse than any civilized being i ever heard .
melville	omoo	“ you sabbee me ? ” he shouted . “ you know me , ah ? well ; me jim , me pilot—been pilot now long time. ” “ ay , ” cried jermin , quite surprised , as indeed we all were , “ you are the pilot , then , you old pagan . why didn ’ t you come off before this ? ”
melville	omoo	“ ah ! me scibbee , —me know—you piratee ( pirate ) —see you long time , but no me come—i sabbee you—you ita maitai nuee ( superlatively bad ) . ” “ paddle away with ye , ” roared jermin , in a rage ; “ be off ! or i ’ ll dart a harpoon at ye ! ”
melville	omoo	but , instead of obeying the order , jim , seizing his paddle , darted the canoe right up to the gangway , and , in two bounds , stood on deck . pulling a greasy silk handkerchief still lower over his brow , and improving the sit of his frock-coat with a vigorous jerk , he then strode up to the mate ; and , in a more flowery style than ever , gave him to understand that the redoubtable “ jim , ” himself , was before him ; that the ship was his until the anchor was down ; and he should like to hear what anyone had to say to it .
melville	omoo	as there now seemed little doubt that he was all he claimed to be , the julia was at last surrendered . our gentleman now proceeded to bring us to an anchor , jumping up between the knight-heads , and bawling out “ luff ! luff ! keepy off ! leeepy off ! ” and insisting upon each time being respectfully responded to by the man at the helm . at this time our steerage-way was almost gone ; and yet , in giving his orders , the passionate old man made as much fuss as a white squall aboard the flying dutchman .
melville	omoo	jim turned out to be the regular pilot of the harbour ; a post , be it known , of no small profit ; and , in his eyes , at least , invested with immense importance . our unceremonious entrance , therefore , was regarded as highly insulting , and tending to depreciate both the dignity and lucrativeness of his office .
melville	omoo	the old man is something of a wizard . having an understanding with the elements , certain phenomena of theirs are exhibited for his particular benefit . unusually clear weather , with a fine steady breeze , is a certain sign that a merchantman is at hand ; whale-spouts seen from the harbour are tokens of a whaling vessel ’ s approach ; and thunder and lightning , happening so seldom as they do , are proof positive that a man-of-war is drawing near .
melville	omoo	in short , jim , the pilot , is quite a character in his way ; and no one visits tahiti without hearing some curious story about him . chapter xxvii . a glance at papeetee—we are sent aboard the frigate
melville	omoo	the village of papeetee struck us all very pleasantly . lying in a semicircle round the bay , the tasteful mansions of the chiefs and foreign residents impart an air of tropical elegance , heightened by the palm-trees waving here and there , and the deep-green groves of the bread-fruit in the background . the squalid huts of the common people are out of sight , and there is nothing to mar the prospect .
melville	omoo	all round the water extends a wide , smooth beach of mixed pebbles and fragments of coral . this forms the thoroughfare of the village ; the handsomest houses all facing it—the fluctuation of the tides being so inconsiderable that they cause no inconvenience .
melville	omoo	the pritchard residence—a fine large building—occupies a site on one side of the bay : a green lawn slopes off to the sea : and in front waves the english flag . across the water , the tricolour also , and the stars and stripes , distinguish the residences of the other consuls .
melville	omoo	what greatly added to the picturesqueness of the bay at this time was the condemned hull of a large ship , which , at the farther end of the harbour , lay bilged upon the beach , its stern settled low in the water , and the other end high and dry . from where we lay , the trees behind seemed to lock their leafy boughs over its bowsprit ; which , from its position , looked nearly upright .
melville	omoo	she was an american whaler , a very old craft . having sprung a leak at sea , she had made all sail for the island , to heave down for repairs . found utterly unseaworthy , however , her oil was taken out and sent home in another vessel ; the hull was then stripped and sold for a trifle .
melville	omoo	before leaving tahiti , i had the curiosity to go over this poor old ship , thus stranded on a strange shore . what were my emotions , when i saw upon her stern the name of a small town on the river hudson ! she was from the noble stream on whose banks i was born ; in whose waters i had a hundred times bathed . in an instant , palm-trees and elms—canoes and skiffs—church spires and bamboos—all mingled in one vision of the present and the past .
melville	omoo	but we must not leave little jule . at last the wishes of many were gratified ; and like an aeronaut ’ s grapnel , her rusty little anchor was caught in the coral groves at the bottom of papeetee bay . this must have been more than forty days after leaving the marquesas .
melville	omoo	the sails were yet unfurled , when a boat came alongside with our esteemed friend wilson , the consul . “ how ’ s this , how ’ s this , mr. jermin ? ” he began , looking very savage as he touched the deck . “ what brings you in without orders ? ”
melville	omoo	“ you did not come off to us , as you promised , sir ; and there was no hanging on longer with nobody to work the ship , ” was the blunt reply . “ so the infernal scoundrels held out—did they ? very good ; i ’ ll make them sweat for it , ” and he eyed the scowling men with unwonted intrepidity . the truth was , he felt safer now , than when outside the reef .
melville	omoo	“ muster the mutineers on the quarter-deck , ” he continued . “ drive them aft , sir , sick and well : i have a word to say to them. ” “ now , men , ” said he , “ you think it ’ s all well with you , i suppose . you wished the ship in , and here she is . captain guy ’ s ashore , and you think you must go too : but we ’ ll see about that—i ’ ll miserably disappoint you. ” ( these last were his very words . ) “ mr . jermin , call off the names of those who did not refuse duty , and let them go over to the starboard side . ”
melville	omoo	this done , a list was made out of the “ mutineers , ” as he was pleased to call the rest . among these , the doctor and myself were included ; though the former stepped forward , and boldly pleaded the office held by him when the vessel left sydney . the mate also—who had always been friendly—stated the service rendered by myself two nights previous , as well as my conduct when he announced his intention to enter the harbour . for myself , i stoutly maintained that , according to the tenor of the agreement made with captain guy , my time aboard the ship had expired—the cruise being virtually at an end , however it had been brought about—and i claimed my discharge .
melville	omoo	but wilson would hear nothing . marking something in my manner , nevertheless , he asked my name and country ; and then observed with a sneer , “ ah , you are the lad , i see , that wrote the round robin ; i ’ ll take good care of you , my fine fellow—step back , sir . ”
melville	omoo	as for poor long ghost , he denounced him as a “ sydney flash-gorger ” ; though what under heaven he meant by that euphonious title is more than i can tell . upon this , the doctor gave him such a piece of his mind that the consul furiously commanded him to hold his peace , or he would instantly have him seized into the rigging and flogged . there was no help for either of us—we were judged by the company we kept .
melville	omoo	all were now sent forward ; not a word being said as to what he intended doing with us . after a talk with the mate , the consul withdrew , going aboard the french frigate , which lay within a cable ’ s length . we now suspected his object ; and since matters had come to this pass , were rejoiced at it . in a day or two the frenchman was to sail for valparaiso , the usual place of rendezvous for the english squadron in the pacific ; and doubtless , wilson meant to put us on board , and send us thither to be delivered up . should our conjecture prove correct , all we had to expect , according to our most experienced shipmates , was the fag end of a cruise in one of her majesty ’ s ships , and a discharge before long at portsmouth .
melville	omoo	we now proceeded to put on all the clothes we could—frock over frock , and trousers over trousers—so as to be in readiness for removal at a moment ’ s warning . armed ships allow nothing superfluous to litter up the deck ; and therefore , should we go aboard the frigate , our chests and their contents would have to be left behind .
melville	omoo	in an hour ’ s time , the first cutter of the reine blanche came alongside , manned by eighteen or twenty sailors , armed with cutlasses and boarding pistols—the officers , of course , wearing their side-arms , and the consul in an official cocked hat borrowed for the occasion . the boat was painted a “ pirate black , ” its crew were a dark , grim-looking set , and the officers uncommonly fierce-looking little frenchmen . on the whole they were calculated to intimidate—the consul ’ s object , doubtless , in bringing them .
melville	omoo	summoned aft again , everyone ’ s name was called separately ; and being solemnly reminded that it was his last chance to escape punishment , was asked if he still refused duty . the response was instantaneous : “ ay , sir , i do. ” in some cases followed up by divers explanatory observations , cut short by wilson ’ s ordering the delinquent to the cutter . as a general thing , the order was promptly obeyed—some taking a sequence of hops , skips , and jumps , by way of showing not only their unimpaired activity of body , but their alacrity in complying with all reasonable requests .
melville	omoo	having avowed their resolution not to pull another rope of the julia ’ s—even if at once restored to perfect health—all the invalids , with the exception of the two to be set ashore , accompanied us into the cutter : they were in high spirits ; so much so that something was insinuated about their not having been quite as ill as pretended .
melville	omoo	the cooper ’ s name was the last called ; we did not hear what he answered , but he stayed behind . nothing was done about the mowree . shoving clear from the ship , three loud cheers were raised ; flash jack and others receiving a sharp reprimand for it from the consul .
melville	omoo	“ good-bye , little jule , ” cried navy bob , as we swept under the bows . “ don ’ t fall overboard , ropey , ” said another to the poor landlubber , who , with wymontoo , the dane , and others left behind , was looking over at us from the forecastle .
melville	omoo	“ give her three more ! ” cried salem , springing to his feet and whirling his hat round . “ you sacre dam raakeel , ” shouted the lieutenant of the party , bringing the flat of his sabre across his shoulders , “ you now keepy steel . ”
melville	omoo	the doctor and myself , more discreet , sat quietly in the bow of the cutter ; and for my own part , though i did not repent what i had done , my reflections were far from being enviable .
melville	omoo	chapter xxviii . reception from the frenchman in a few moments , we were paraded in the frigate ’ s gangway ; the first lieutenant—an elderly yellow-faced officer , in an ill-cut coat and tarnished gold lace—coming up , and frowning upon us .
melville	omoo	this gentleman ’ s head was a mere bald spot ; his legs , sticks ; in short , his whole physical vigour seemed exhausted in the production of one enormous moustache . old gamboge , as he was forthwith christened , now received a paper from the consul ; and , opening it , proceeded to compare the goods delivered with the invoice .
melville	omoo	after being thoroughly counted , a meek little midshipman was called , and we were soon after given in custody to half-a-dozen sailor-soldiers—fellows with tarpaulins and muskets . preceded by a pompous functionary ( whom we took for one of the ship ’ s corporals , from his ratan and the gold lace on his sleeve ) , we were now escorted down the ladders to the berth-deck .
melville	omoo	here we were politely handcuffed , all round ; the man with the bamboo evincing the utmost solicitude in giving us a good fit from a large basket of the articles of assorted sizes .
melville	omoo	taken by surprise at such an uncivil reception , a few of the party demurred ; but all coyness was , at last , overcome ; and finally our feet were inserted into heavy anklets of iron , running along a great bar bolted down to the deck . after this , we considered ourselves permanently established in our new quarters .
melville	omoo	“ the deuce take their old iron ! ” exclaimed the doctor ; “ if i ’ d known this , i ’ d stayed behind. ” “ ha , ha ! ” cried flash jack , “ you ’ re in for it , doctor long ghost. ” “ my hands and feet are , any way , ” was the reply .
melville	omoo	they placed a sentry over us ; a great lubber of a fellow , who marched up and down with a dilapidated old cutlass of most extraordinary dimensions . from its length , we had some idea that it was expressly intended to keep a crowd in order—reaching over the heads of half-a-dozen , say , so as to get a cut at somebody behind .
melville	omoo	“ mercy ! ” ejaculated the doctor with a shudder , “ what a sensation it must be to be killed by such a tool. ” we fasted till night , when one of the boys came along with a couple of “ kids ” containing a thin , saffron-coloured fluid , with oily particles floating on top . the young wag told us this was soup : it turned out to be nothing more than oleaginous warm water . such as it was , nevertheless , we were fain to make a meal of it , our sentry being attentive enough to undo our bracelets . the “ kids ” passed from mouth to mouth , and were soon emptied .
melville	omoo	the next morning , when the sentry ’ s back was turned , someone , whom we took for an english sailor , tossed over a few oranges , the rinds of which we afterward used for cups .
melville	omoo	on the second day nothing happened worthy of record . on the third , we were amused by the following scene . a man , whom we supposed a boatswain ’ s mate , from the silver whistle hanging from his neck , came below , driving before him a couple of blubbering boys , and followed by a whole troop of youngsters in tears . the pair , it seemed , were sent down to be punished by command of an officer ; the rest had accompanied them out of sympathy .
melville	omoo	the boatswain ’ s mate went to work without delay , seizing the poor little culprits by their loose frocks , and using a ratan without mercy . the other boys wept , clasped their hands , and fell on their knees ; but in vain ; the boatswain ’ s mate only hit out at them ; once in a while making them yell ten times louder than ever .
melville	omoo	in the midst of the tumult , down comes a midshipman , who , with a great air , orders the man on deck , and running in among the boys , sets them to scampering in all directions .
melville	omoo	the whole of this proceeding was regarded with infinite scorn by navy bob , who , years before , had been captain of the foretop on board a line-of-battle ship . in his estimation , it was a lubberly piece of business throughout : they did things differently in the english navy .
melville	omoo	chapter xxix . the reine blanche i can not forbear a brief reflection upon the scene ending the last chapter . the ratanning of the young culprits , although significant of the imperfect discipline of a french man-of-war , may also be considered as in some measure characteristic of the nation .
melville	omoo	in an american or english ship , a boy when flogged is either lashed to the breech of a gun , or brought right up to the gratings , the same way the men are . but as a general rule , he is never punished beyond his strength . you seldom or never draw a cry from the young rogue . he bites his tongue and stands up to it like a hero . if practicable ( which is not always the case ) , he makes a point of smiling under the operation . and so far from his companions taking any compassion on him , they always make merry over his misfortunes . should he turn baby and cry , they are pretty sure to give him afterward a sly pounding in some dark corner .
melville	omoo	this tough training produces its legitimate results . the boy becomes , in time , a thoroughbred tar , equally ready to strip and take a dozen on board his own ship , or , cutlass in hand , dash pell-mell on board the enemy ’ s . whereas the young frenchman , as all the world knows , makes but an indifferent seaman ; and though , for the most part , he fights well enough , somehow or other he seldom fights well enough to beat .
melville	omoo	how few sea-battles have the french ever won ! but more : how few ships have they ever carried by the board—that true criterion of naval courage ! but not a word against french bravery—there is plenty of it ; but not of the right sort . a yankee ’ s , or an englishman ’ s , is the downright waterloo “ game. ” the french fight better on land ; and not being essentially a maritime people , they ought to stay there . the best of shipwrights , they are no sailors .
melville	omoo	and this carries me back to the reine blanche , as noble a specimen of what wood and iron can make as ever floated . she was a new ship : the present her maiden cruise . the greatest pains having been taken in her construction , she was accounted the “ crack ” craft in the french navy . she is one of the heavy sixty-gun frigates now in vogue all over the world , and which we yankees were the first to introduce . in action these are the most murderous vessels ever launched .
melville	omoo	the model of the reine blanche has all that warlike comeliness only to be seen in a fine fighting ship . still , there is a good deal of french flummery about her—brass plates and other gewgaws stuck on all over , like baubles on a handsome woman .
melville	omoo	among other things , she carries a stern gallery resting on the uplifted hands of two caryatides , larger than life . you step out upon this from the commodore ’ s cabin . to behold the rich hangings , and mirrors , and mahogany within , one is almost prepared to see a bevy of ladies trip forth on the balcony for an airing .
melville	omoo	but come to tread the gun-deck , and all thoughts like these are put to flight . such batteries of thunderbolt hurlers ! with a sixty-eight-pounder or two thrown in as make-weights . on the spar-deck , also , are carronades of enormous calibre .
melville	omoo	recently built , this vessel , of course , had the benefit of the latest improvements . i was quite amazed to see on what high principles of art some exceedingly simple things were done . but your gaul is scientific about everything ; what other people accomplish by a few hard knocks , he delights in achieving by a complex arrangement of the pulley , lever , and screw .
melville	omoo	what demi-semi-quavers in a french air ! in exchanging naval courtesies , i have known a french band play “ yankee doodle ” with such a string of variations that no one but a “ pretty ’ cute ” yankee could tell what they were at .
melville	omoo	in the french navy they have no marines ; their men , taking turns at carrying the musket , are sailors one moment , and soldiers the next ; a fellow running aloft in his line frock to-day , to-morrow stands sentry at the admiral ’ s cabin door . this is fatal to anything like proper sailor pride . to make a man a seaman , he should be put to no other duty . indeed , a thorough tar is unfit for anything else ; and what is more , this fact is the best evidence of his being a true sailor .
melville	omoo	on board the reine blanche , they did not have enough to eat ; and what they did have was not of the right sort . instead of letting the sailors file their teeth against the rim of a hard sea-biscuit , they baked their bread daily in pitiful little rolls . then they had no “ grog ” ; as a substitute , they drugged the poor fellows with a thin , sour wine—the juice of a few grapes , perhaps , to a pint of the juice of water-faucets . moreover , the sailors asked for meat , and they gave them soup ; a rascally substitute , as they well knew .
melville	omoo	ever since leaving home , they had been on “ short allowance. ” at the present time , those belonging to the boats—and thus getting an occasional opportunity to run ashore—frequently sold their rations of bread to some less fortunate shipmate for sixfold its real value .
melville	omoo	another thing tending to promote dissatisfaction among the crew was their having such a devil of a fellow for a captain . he was one of those horrid naval bores—a great disciplinarian . in port , he kept them constantly exercising yards and sails , and maneuvering with the boats ; and at sea , they were forever at quarters ; running in and out the enormous guns , as if their arms were made for nothing else . then there was the admiral aboard , also ; and , no doubt , he too had a paternal eye over them .
melville	omoo	in the ordinary routine of duty , we could not but be struck with the listless , slovenly behaviour of these men ; there was nothing of the national vivacity in their movements ; nothing of the quick precision perceptible on the deck of a thoroughly-disciplined armed vessel .
melville	omoo	all this , however , when we came to know the reason , was no matter of surprise ; three-fourths of them were pressed men . some old merchant sailors had been seized the very day they landed from distant voyages ; while the landsmen , of whom there were many , had been driven down from the country in herds , and so sent to sea .
melville	omoo	at the time , i was quite amazed to hear of press-gangs in a day of comparative peace ; but the anomaly is accounted for by the fact that , of late , the french have been building up a great military marine , to take the place of that which nelson gave to the waves of the sea at trafalgar . but it is to be hoped that they are not building their ships for the people across the channel to take . in case of a war , what a fluttering of french ensigns there would be !
melville	omoo	though i say the french are no sailors , i am far from seeking to underrate them as a people . they are an ingenious and right gallant nation . and , as an american , i take pride in asserting it .
melville	omoo	chapter xxx . they take us ashore—what happened there five days and nights , if i remember right , we were aboard the frigate . on the afternoon of the fifth , we were told that the next morning she sailed for valparaiso . rejoiced at this , we prayed for a speedy passage . but , as it turned out , the consul had no idea of letting us off so easily . to our no small surprise , an officer came along toward night , and ordered us out of irons . being then mustered in the gangway , we were escorted into a cutter alongside , and pulled ashore .
melville	omoo	accosted by wilson as we struck the beach , he delivered us up to a numerous guard of natives , who at once conducted us to a house near by . here we were made to sit down under a shade without ; and the consul and two elderly european residents passed by us , and entered .
melville	omoo	after some delay , during which we were much diverted by the hilarious good-nature of our guard—one of our number was called out for , followed by an order for him to enter the house alone .
melville	omoo	on returning a moment after , he told us we had little to encounter . it had simply been asked whether he still continued of the same mind ; on replying yes , something was put down upon a piece of paper , and he was waved outside . all being summoned in rotation , my own turn came at last .
melville	omoo	within , wilson and his two friends were seated magisterially at a table—an inkstand , a pen , and a sheet of paper lending quite a business-like air to the apartment . these three gentlemen , being arrayed in coats and pantaloons , looked respectable , at least in a country where complete suits of garments are so seldom met with . one present essayed a solemn aspect ; but having a short neck and full face , only made out to look stupid .
melville	omoo	it was this individual who condescended to take a paternal interest in myself . after declaring my resolution with respect to the ship unalterable , i was proceeding to withdraw , in compliance with a sign from the consul , when the stranger turned round to him , saying , “ wait a minute , if you please , mr. wilson ; let me talk to that youth . come here , my young friend : i ’ m extremely sorry to see you associated with these bad men ; do you know what it will end in ? ”
melville	omoo	“ oh , that ’ s the lad that wrote the round robin , ” interposed the consul . “ he and that rascally doctor are at the bottom of the whole affair—go outside , sir. ” i retired as from the presence of royalty ; backing out with many bows .
melville	omoo	the evident prejudice of wilson against both the doctor and myself was by no means inexplicable . a man of any education before the mast is always looked upon with dislike by his captain ; and , never mind how peaceable he may be , should any disturbance arise , from his intellectual superiority , he is deemed to exert an underhand influence against the officers .
melville	omoo	little as i had seen of captain guy , the few glances cast upon me after being on board a week or so were sufficient to reveal his enmity—a feeling quickened by my undisguised companionship with long ghost , whom he both feared and cordially hated . guy ’ s relations with the consul readily explains the latter ’ s hostility .
melville	omoo	the examination over , wilson and his friends advanced to the doorway ; when the former , assuming a severe expression , pronounced our perverseness infatuation in the extreme . nor was there any hope left : our last chance for pardon was gone . even were we to become contrite and crave permission to return to duty , it would not now be permitted .
melville	omoo	“ oh ! get along with your gammon , counsellor , ” exclaimed black dan , absolutely indignant that his understanding should be thus insulted . quite enraged , wilson bade him hold his peace ; and then , summoning a fat old native to his side , addressed him in tahitian , giving directions for leading us away to a place of safe keeping .
melville	omoo	hereupon , being marshalled in order , with the old man at our head , we were put in motion , with loud shouts , along a fine pathway , running far on through wide groves of the cocoa-nut and bread-fruit .
melville	omoo	the rest of our escort trotted on beside us in high good-humour ; jabbering broken english , and in a hundred ways giving us to understand that wilson was no favourite of theirs , and that we were prime , good fellows for holding out as we did . they seemed to know our whole history .
melville	omoo	the scenery around was delightful . the tropical day was fast drawing to a close ; and from where we were , the sun looked like a vast red fire burning in the woodlands—its rays falling aslant through the endless ranks of trees , and every leaf fringed with flame . escaped from the confined decks of the frigate , the air breathed spices to us ; streams were heard flowing ; green boughs were rocking ; and far inland , all sunset flushed , rose the still , steep peaks of the island .
melville	omoo	as we proceeded , i was more and more struck by the picturesqueness of the wide , shaded road . in several places , durable bridges of wood were thrown over large water-courses ; others were spanned by a single arch of stone . in any part of the road , three horsemen might have ridden abreast .
melville	omoo	this beautiful avenue—by far the best thing which civilization has done for the island—is called by foreigners “ the broom road , ” though for what reason i do not know . originally planned for the convenience of the missionaries journeying from one station to another , it almost completely encompasses the larger peninsula ; skirting for a distance of at least sixty miles along the low , fertile lands bordering the sea . but on the side next taiarboo , or the lesser peninsula , it sweeps through a narrow , secluded valley , and thus crosses the island in that direction .
melville	omoo	the uninhabited interior , being almost impenetrable from the densely-wooded glens , frightful precipices , and sharp mountain ridges absolutely inaccessible , is but little known , even to the natives themselves ; and so , instead of striking directly across from one village to another , they follow the broom road round and round .
melville	omoo	it is by no means , however , altogether travelled on foot ; horses being now quite plentiful . they were introduced from chili ; and possessing all the gaiety , fleetness , and docility of the spanish breed , are admirably adapted to the tastes of the higher classes , who as equestrians have become very expert . the missionaries and chiefs never think of journeying except in the saddle ; and at all hours of the day you see the latter galloping along at full speed . like the sandwich islanders , they ride like pawnee-loups .
melville	omoo	for miles and miles i have travelled the broom road , and never wearied of the continual change of scenery . but wherever it leads you—whether through level woods , across grassy glens , or over hills waving with palms—the bright blue sea on one side , and the green mountain pinnacles on the other , are always in sight .
melville	omoo	chapter xxxi . the calabooza beretanee about a mile from the village we came to a halt . it was a beautiful spot . a mountain stream here flowed at the foot of a verdant slope ; on one hand , it murmured along until the waters , spreading themselves upon a beach of small , sparkling shells , trickled into the sea ; on the other was a long defile , where the eye pursued a gleaming , sinuous thread , lost in shade and verdure .
melville	omoo	the ground next the road was walled in by a low , rude parapet of stones ; and , upon the summit of the slope beyond , was a large , native house , the thatch dazzling white , and in shape an oval .
melville	omoo	“ calabooza ! calabooza beretanee ! ” ( the english jail ) , cried our conductor , pointing to the building . for a few months past , having been used by the consul as a house of confinement for his refractory sailors , it was thus styled to distinguish it from similar places in and about papeetee .
melville	omoo	though extremely romantic in appearance , on a near approach it proved hut ill adapted to domestic comfort . in short , it was a mere shell , recently built , and still unfinished . it was open all round , and tufts of grass were growing here and there under the very roof . the only piece of furniture was the “ stocks , ” a clumsy machine for keeping people in one place , which , i believe , is pretty much out of date in most countries . it is still in use , however , among the spaniards in south america ; from whom , it seems , the tahitians have borrowed the contrivance , as well as the name by which all places of confinement are known among them .
melville	omoo	the stocks were nothing more than two stout timbers , about twenty feet in length , and precisely alike . one was placed edgeways on the ground , and the other , resting on top , left , at regular intervals along the seam , several round holes , the object of which was evident at a glance .
melville	omoo	by this time , our guide had informed us that he went by the name of “ capin bob ” ( captain bob ) ; and a hearty old bob he proved . it was just the name for him . from the first , so pleased were we with the old man that we cheerfully acquiesced in his authority .
melville	omoo	entering the building , he set us about fetching heaps of dry leaves to spread behind the stocks for a couch . a trunk of a small cocoa-nut tree was then placed for a bolster—rather a hard one , but the natives are used to it . for a pillow , they use a little billet of wood , scooped out , and standing on four short legs—a sort of head-stool .
melville	omoo	these arrangements completed , captain bob proceeded to “ hanna-par , ” or secure us , for the night . the upper timber of the machine being lifted at one end , and our ankles placed in the semicircular spaces of the lower one , the other beam was then , dropped ; both being finally secured together by an old iron hoop at either extremity . this initiation was performed to the boisterous mirth of the natives , and diverted ourselves not a little .
melville	omoo	captain bob now bustled about , like an old woman seeing the children to bed . a basket of baked “ taro , ” or indian turnip , was brought in , and we were given a piece all round . then a great counterpane of coarse , brown “ tappa , ” was stretched over the whole party ; and , after sundry injunctions to “ moee-moee , ” and be “ maitai ” —in other words , to go to sleep , and be good boys—we were left to ourselves , fairly put to bed and tucked in .
melville	omoo	much talk was now had concerning our prospects in life ; but the doctor and i , who lay side by side , thinking the occasion better adapted to meditation , kept pretty silent ; and , before long , the rest ceased conversing , and , wearied with loss of rest on board the frigate , were soon sound asleep .
melville	omoo	after sliding from one reverie into another , i started , and gave the doctor a pinch . he was dreaming , however ; and , resolved to follow his example , i troubled him no more .
melville	omoo	how the rest managed , i know not ; but for my own part , i found it very hard to get to sleep . the consciousness of having one ’ s foot pinned ; and the impossibility of getting it anywhere else than just where it was , was most distressing .
melville	omoo	but this was not all : there was no way of lying but straight on your back ; unless , to be sure , one ’ s limb went round and round in the ankle , like a swivel . upon getting into a sort of doze , it was no wonder this uneasy posture gave me the nightmare . under the delusion that i was about some gymnastics or other , i gave my unfortunate member such a twitch that i started up with the idea that someone was dragging the stocks away .
melville	omoo	captain bob and his friends lived in a little hamlet hard by ; and when morning showed in the east , the old gentleman came forth from that direction likewise , emerging from a grove , and saluting us loudly as he approached .
melville	omoo	finding everybody awake , he set us at liberty ; and , leading us down to the stream , ordered every man to strip and bathe . “ all han ’ s , my boy , hanna-hanna , wash ! ” he cried . bob was a linguist , and had been to sea in his day , as he many a time afterwards told us .
melville	omoo	at this moment , we were all alone with him ; and it would have been the easiest thing in the world to have given him the slip ; but he seemed to have no idea of such a thing ; treating us so frankly and cordially , indeed , that even had we thought of running , we should have been ashamed of attempting it . he very well knew , nevertheless ( as we ourselves were not slow in finding out ) , that , for various reasons , any attempt of the kind , without some previously arranged plan for leaving the island , would be certain to fail .
melville	omoo	as bob was a rare one every way , i must give some account of him . there was a good deal of “ personal appearance ” about him ; in short , he was a corpulent giant , over six feet in height , and literally as big round as a hogshead . the enormous bulk of some of the tahitians has been frequently spoken of by voyagers .
melville	omoo	beside being the english consul ’ s jailer , as it were , he carried on a little tahitian farming ; that is to say , he owned several groves of the bread-fruit and palm , and never hindered their growing . close by was a “ taro ” patch of his which he occasionally visited .
melville	omoo	bob seldom disposed of the produce of his lands ; it was all needed for domestic consumption . indeed , for gormandizing , i would have matched him against any three common-council men at a civic feast .
melville	omoo	a friend of bob ’ s told me that , owing to his voraciousness , his visits to other parts of the island were much dreaded ; for , according to tahitian customs , hospitality without charge is enjoined upon everyone ; and though it is reciprocal in most cases , in bob ’ s it was almost out of the question . the damage done to a native larder in one of his morning calls was more than could be made good by his entertainer ’ s spending the holidays with them .
melville	omoo	the old man , as i have hinted , had , once upon a time , been a cruise or two in a whaling-vessel ; and , therefore , he prided himself upon his english . having acquired what he knew of it in the forecastle , he talked little else than sailor phrases , which sounded whimsically enough .
melville	omoo	i asked him one day how old he was . “ olee ? ” he exclaimed , looking very profound in consequence of thoroughly understanding so subtile a question— “ oh ! very olee— ’ tousand ’ ear—more—big man when capin tootee ( captain cook ) heavey in sight. ” ( in sea parlance , came into view . )
melville	omoo	this was a thing impossible ; but adapting my discourse to the man , i rejoined— “ ah ! you see capin tootee—well , how you like him ? ” “ oh ! he maitai : ( good ) friend of me , and know my wife . ”
melville	omoo	on my assuring him strongly that he could not have been born at the time , he explained himself by saying that he was speaking of his father , all the while . this , indeed , might very well have been .
melville	omoo	it is a curious fact that all these people , young and old , will tell you that they have enjoyed the honour of a personal acquaintance with the great navigator ; and if you listen to them , they will go on and tell anecdotes without end . this springs from nothing but their great desire to please ; well knowing that a more agreeable topic for a white man could not be selected . as for the anachronism of the thing , they seem to have no idea of it : days and years are all the same to them .
melville	omoo	after our sunrise bath , bob once more placed us in the stocks , almost moved to tears at subjecting us to so great a hardship ; but he could not treat us otherwise , he said , on pain of the consul ’ s displeasure . how long we were to be confined , he did not know ; nor what was to be done with us in the end .
melville	omoo	as noon advanced , and no signs of a meal were visible , someone inquired whether we were to be boarded , as well as lodged , at the hotel de calabooza ? “ vast heavey ” ( avast heaving , or wait a bit ) —said bob— “ kow-kow ” ( food ) “ come ship by by . ”
melville	omoo	and , sure enough , along comes rope tarn with a wooden bucket of the julia ’ s villainous biscuit . with a grin , he said it was a present from wilson : it was all we were to get that day . a great cry was now raised ; and well was it for the land-lubber that lie had a pair of legs , and the men could not use theirs . one and all , we resolved not to touch the bread , come what come might ; and so we told the natives .
melville	omoo	being extravagantly fond of ship-biscuit—the harder the better—they were quite overjoyed ; and offered to give us , every day , a small quantity of baked bread-fruit and indian turnip in exchange for the bread . this we agreed to ; and every morning afterward , when the bucket came , its contents were at once handed over to bob and his friends , who never ceased munching until nightfall .
melville	omoo	our exceedingly frugal meal of bread-fruit over , captain bob waddled up to us with a couple of long poles hooked at one end , and several large baskets of woven cocoa-nut branches .
melville	omoo	not far off was an extensive grove of orange-trees in full bearing ; and myself and another were selected to go with him , and gather a supply for the party . when we went in among the trees , the sumptuousness of the orchard was unlike anything i had ever seen ; while the fragrance shaken from the gently waving boughs regaled our senses most delightfully .
melville	omoo	in many places the trees formed a dense shade , spreading overhead a dark , rustling vault , groined with boughs , and studded here and there with the ripened spheres , like gilded balls . in several places , the overladen branches were borne to the earth , hiding the trunk in a tent of foliage . once fairly in the grove , we could see nothing else ; it was oranges all round .
melville	omoo	to preserve the fruit from bruising , bob , hooking the twigs with his pole , let them fall into his basket . but this would not do for us . seizing hold of a bough , we brought such a shower to the ground that our old friend was fain to run from under . heedless of remonstrance , we then reclined in the shade , and feasted to our heart ’ s content . heaping up the baskets afterwards , we returned to our comrades , by whom our arrival was hailed with loud plaudits ; and in a marvellously short time , nothing was left of the oranges we brought but the rinds .
melville	omoo	while inmates of the calabooza , we had as much of the fruit as we wanted ; and to this cause , and others that might be mentioned , may be ascribed the speedy restoration of our sick to comparative health .
melville	omoo	the orange of tahiti is delicious—small and sweet , with a thin , dry rind . though now abounding , it was unknown before cook ’ s time , to whom the natives are indebted for so great a blessing . he likewise introduced several other kinds of fruit ; among these were the fig , pineapple , and lemon , now seldom met with . the lime still grows , and some of the poorer natives express the juice to sell to the shipping . it is highly valued as an anti-scorbutic . nor was the variety of foreign fruits and vegetables which were introduced the only benefit conferred by the first visitors to the society group . cattle and sheep were left at various places . more of them anon .
melville	omoo	thus , after all that of late years has been done for these islanders , cook and vancouver may , in one sense at least , be considered their greatest benefactors . chapter xxxii . proceedings of the french at tahiti
melville	omoo	as i happened to arrive at the island at a very interesting period in its political affairs , it may be well to give some little account here of the proceedings of the french , by way of episode to the narrative . my information was obtained at the time from the general reports then rife among the natives , as well as from what i learned upon a subsequent visit , and reliable accounts which i have seen since reaching home .
melville	omoo	it seems that for some time back the french had been making repeated ineffectual attempts to plant a roman catholic mission here . but , invariably treated with contumely , they sometimes met with open violence ; and , in every case , those directly concerned in the enterprise were ultimately forced to depart . in one instance , two priests , laval and caset , after enduring a series of persecutions , were set upon by the natives , maltreated , and finally carried aboard a small trading schooner , which eventually put them ashore at wallis ’ island—a savage place—some two thousand miles to the westward .
melville	omoo	now , that the resident english missionaries authorized the banishment of these priests is a fact undenied by themselves . i was also repeatedly informed that by their inflammatory harangues they instigated the riots which preceded the sailing of the schooner . at all events , it is certain that their unbounded influence with the natives would easily have enabled them to prevent everything that took place on this occasion , had they felt so inclined .
melville	omoo	melancholy as such an example of intolerance on the part of protestant missionaries must appear , it is not the only one , and by no means the most flagrant , which might be presented . but i forbear to mention any others ; since they have been more than hinted at by recent voyagers , and their repetition here would perhaps be attended with no good effect . besides , the conduct of the sandwich island missionaries in particular has latterly much amended in this respect .
melville	omoo	the treatment of the two priests formed the principal ground ( and the only justifiable one ) upon which du petit thouars demanded satisfaction ; and which subsequently led to his seizure of the island . in addition to other things , he also charged that the flag of merenhout , the consul , had been repeatedly insulted , and the property of a certain french resident violently appropriated by the government . in the latter instance , the natives were perfectly in the right . at that time , the law against the traffic in ardent spirits ( every now and then suspended and revived ) happened to be in force ; and finding a large quantity on the premises of victor , a low , knavish adventurer from marseilles , the tahitians pronounced it forfeit .
melville	omoo	for these , and similar alleged outrages , a large pecuniary restitution was demanded ( 10,000 dollars ) , which there being no exchequer to supply , the island was forthwith seized , under cover of a mock treaty , dictated to the chiefs on the gun-deck of du petit thouars ’ frigate .
melville	omoo	but , notwithstanding this formality , there seems now little doubt that the downfall of the pomarees was decided upon at the tuilleries . after establishing the protectorate , so called , the rear-admiral sailed ; leaving m. bruat governor , assisted by reine and carpegne , civilians , named members of the council of government , and merenhout , the consul , now made commissioner royal . no soldiers , however , were landed until several months afterward . as men , reine and carpegne were not disliked by the natives ; but bruat and merenhout they bitterly detested . in several interviews with the poor queen , the unfeeling governor sought to terrify her into compliance with his demands ; clapping his hand upon his sword , shaking his fist in her face , and swearing violently . “ oh , king of a great nation , ” said pomaree , in her letter to louis philippe , “ fetch away this man ; i and my people can not endure his evil doings . he is a shameless man . ”
melville	omoo	although the excitement among the natives did not wholly subside upon the rear-admiral ’ s departure , no overt act of violence immediately followed . the queen had fled to imeeo ; and the dissensions among the chiefs , together with the ill-advised conduct of the missionaries , prevented a union upon some common plan of resistance . but the great body of the people , as well as their queen , confidently relied upon the speedy interposition of england—a nation bound to them by many ties , and which , more than once , had solemnly guaranteed their independence .
melville	omoo	as for the missionaries , they openly defied the french governor , childishly predicting fleets and armies from britain . but what is the welfare of a spot like tahiti to the mighty interests of france and england ! there was a remonstrance on one side , and a reply on the other ; and there the matter rested . for once in their brawling lives , st. george and st. denis were hand and glove ; and they were not going to cross sabres about tahiti .
melville	omoo	during my stay upon the island , so far as i could see , there was little to denote that any change had taken place in the government . such laws as they had were administered the same as ever ; the missionaries went about unmolested , and comparative tranquillity everywhere prevailed . nevertheless , i sometimes heard the natives inveighing against the french ( no favourites , by the bye , throughout polynesia ) , and bitterly regretting that the queen had not , at the outset , made a stand .
melville	omoo	in the house of the chief adeea , frequent discussions took place concerning the ability of the island to cope with the french : the number of fighting men and muskets among the natives were talked of , as well as the propriety of fortifying several heights overlooking papeetee . imputing these symptoms to the mere resentment of a recent outrage , and not to any determined spirit of resistance , i little anticipated the gallant , though useless warfare , so soon to follow my departure .
melville	omoo	at a period subsequent to my first visit , the island , which before was divided into nineteen districts , with a native chief over each , in capacity of governor and judge , was , by bruat , divided into four . over these he set as many recreant chiefs , kitoti , tati , utamai , and paraita ; to whom he paid 1000 dollars each , to secure their assistance in carrying out his evil designs .
melville	omoo	the first blood shed , in any regular conflict , was at mahanar , upon the peninsula of taraiboo . the fight originated in the seizure of a number of women from the shore by men belonging to one of the french vessels of war . in this affair , the islanders fought desperately , killing about fifty of the enemy , and losing ninety of their own number . the french sailors and marines , who , at the time , were reported to be infuriated with liquor , gave no quarter ; and the survivors only saved themselves by fleeing to the mountains . subsequently , the battles of hararparpi and fararar were fought , in which the invaders met with indifferent success .
melville	omoo	shortly after the engagement at hararparpi , three frenchmen were waylaid in a pass of the valleys , and murdered by the incensed natives . one was lefevre , a notorious scoundrel , and a spy , whom bruat had sent to conduct a certain major fergus ( said to be a pole ) to the hiding-place of four chiefs , whom the governor wished to seize and execute . this circumstance violently inflamed the hostility of both parties .
melville	omoo	about this time , kitoti , a depraved chief , and the pliant tool of bruat , was induced by him to give a great feast in the vale of paree , to which all his countrymen were invited . the governor ’ s object was to gain over all he could to his interests ; he supplied an abundance of wine and brandy , and a scene of bestial intoxication was the natural consequence . before it came to this , however , several speeches were made by the islanders . one of these , delivered by an aged warrior , who had formerly been at the head of the celebrated aeorai society , was characteristic . “ this is a very good feast , ” said the reeling old man , “ and the wine also is very good ; but you evil-minded wee-wees ( french ) , and you false-hearted men of tahiti , are all very bad . ”
melville	omoo	by the latest accounts , most of the islanders still refuse to submit to the french ; and what turn events may hereafter take , it is hard to predict . at any rate , these disorders must accelerate the final extinction of their race .
melville	omoo	along with the few officers left by du petit thouars were several french priests , for whose unobstructed exertions in the dissemination of their faith , the strongest guarantees were provided by an article of the treaty . but no one was bound to offer them facilities ; much less a luncheon , the first day they went ashore . true , they had plenty of gold ; but to the natives it was anathema—taboo—and , for several hours and some odd minutes , they would not touch it . emissaries of the pope and the devil , as the strangers were considered—the smell of sulphur hardly yet shaken out of their canonicals—what islander would venture to jeopardize his soul , and call down a blight on his breadfruit , by holding any intercourse with them ! that morning the priests actually picknicked in grove of cocoa-nut trees ; but , before night , christian hospitality—in exchange for a commercial equivalent of hard dollars—was given them in an adjoining house .
melville	omoo	wanting in civility , as the conduct of the english missionaries may be thought , in withholding a decent reception to these persons , the latter were certainly to blame in needlessly placing themselves in so unpleasant a predicament . under far better auspices , they might have settled upon some one of the thousand unconverted isles of the pacific , rather than have forced themselves thus upon a people already professedly christians .
melville	omoo	chapter xxxiii . we receive calls at the hotel de calabooza our place of confinement being open all round , and so near the broom road , of course we were in plain sight of everybody passing ; and , therefore , we had no lack of visitors among such an idle , inquisitive set as the tahitians . for a few days , they were coming and going continually ; while , thus ignobly fast by the foot , we were fain to give passive audience .
melville	omoo	during this period , we were the lions of the neighbourhood ; and , no doubt , strangers from the distant villages were taken to see the “ karhowrees ” ( white men ) , in the same way that countrymen , in a city , are gallanted to the zoological gardens .
melville	omoo	all this gave us a fine opportunity of making observations . i was painfully struck by the considerable number of sickly or deformed persons ; undoubtedly made so by a virulent complaint , which , under native treatment , almost invariably affects , in the end , the muscles and bones of the body . in particular , there is a distortion of the back , most unsightly to behold , originating in a horrible form of the malady .
melville	omoo	although this , and other bodily afflictions , were unknown before the discovery of the islands by the whites , there are several cases found of the fa-fa , or elephantiasis—a native disease , which seems to have prevailed among them from the earliest antiquity . affecting the legs and feet alone , it swells them , in some instances , to the girth of a man ’ s body , covering the skin with scales . it might be supposed that one , thus afflicted , would be incapable of walking ; but , to all appearance , they seem to be nearly as active as anybody ; apparently suffering no pain , and bearing the calamity with a degree of cheerfulness truly marvellous .
melville	omoo	the fa-fa is very gradual in its approaches , and years elapse before the limb is fully swollen . its origin is ascribed by the natives to various causes ; but the general impression seems to be that it arises , in most cases , from the eating of unripe bread-fruit and indian turnip . so far as i could find out , it is not hereditary . in no stage do they attempt a cure ; the complaint being held incurable .
melville	omoo	speaking of the fa-fa reminds me of a poor fellow , a sailor , whom i afterward saw at roorootoo , a lone island , some two days ’ sail from tahiti . the island is very small , and its inhabitants nearly extinct . we sent a boat off to see whether any yams were to be had , as , formerly , the yams of roorootoo were as famous among the islands round about , as sicily oranges in the mediterranean . going ashore , to my surprise , i was accosted , near a little shanty of a church , by a white man , who limped forth from a wretched hut . his hair and beard were unshorn , his face deadly pale and haggard , and one limb swelled with the fa-fa to an incredible bigness . this was the first instance of a foreigner suffering from it that i had ever seen , or heard of ; and the spectacle shocked me accordingly .
melville	omoo	he had been there for years . from the first symptoms , he could not believe his complaint to be what it really was , and trusted it would soon disappear . but when it became plain that his only chance for recovery was a speedy change of climate , no ship would receive him as a sailor : to think of being taken as a passenger was idle . this speaks little for the humanity of sea captains ; but the truth is that those in the pacific have little enough of the virtue ; and , nowadays , when so many charitable appeals are made to them , they have become callous .
melville	omoo	i pitied the poor fellow from the bottom of my heart ; but nothing could i do , as our captain was inexorable . “ why , ” said he , “ here we are—started on a six months ’ cruise—i can ’ t put back ; and he is better off on the island than at sea . so on roorootoo he must die. ” and probably he did .
melville	omoo	i afterwards heard of this melancholy object , from two seamen . his attempts to leave were still unavailing , and his hard fate was fast closing in . notwithstanding the physical degeneracy of the tahitians as a people , among the chiefs , individuals of personable figures are still frequently met with ; and , occasionally , majestic-looking men , and diminutive women as lovely as the nymphs who , nearly a century ago , swam round the ships of wallis . in these instances , tahitian beauty is quite as seducing as it proved to the crew of the bounty ; the young girls being just such creatures as a poet would picture in the tropics—soft , plump , and dreamy-eyed .
melville	omoo	the natural complexion of both sexes is quite light ; but the males appear much darker , from their exposure to the sun . a dark complexion , however , in a man , is highly esteemed , as indicating strength of both body and soul . hence there is a saying , of great antiquity among them .
melville	omoo	“ if dark the cheek of the mother , the son will sound the war-conch ; if strong her frame , he will give laws. ” with this idea of manliness , no wonder the tahitians regarded all pale and tepid-looking europeans as weak and feminine ; whereas , a sailor , with a cheek like the breast of a roast turkey , is held a lad of brawn : to use their own phrase , a “ taata tona , ” or man of bones .
melville	omoo	speaking of bones recalls an ugly custom of theirs , now obsolete—that of making fish-hooks and gimlets out of those of their enemies . this beats the scandinavians turning people ’ s skulls into cups and saucers .
melville	omoo	but to return to the calabooza beretanee . immense was the interest we excited among the throngs that called there ; they would stand talking about us by the hour , growing most unnecessarily excited too , and dancing up and down with all the vivacity of their race . they invariably sided with us ; flying out against the consul , and denouncing him as “ ita maitai nuee , ” or very bad exceedingly . they must have borne him some grudge or other .
melville	omoo	nor were the women , sweet souls , at all backward in visiting . indeed , they manifested even more interest than the men ; gazing at us with eyes full of a thousand meanings , and conversing with marvellous rapidity . but , alas ! inquisitive though they were , and , doubtless , taking some passing compassion on us , there was little real feeling in them after all , and still less sentimental sympathy . many of them laughed outright at us , noting only what was ridiculous in our plight .
melville	omoo	i think it was the second day of our confinement that a wild , beautiful girl burst into the calabooza , and , throwing herself into an arch attitude , stood afar off , and gazed at us . she was a heartless one : —tickled to death with black dan ’ s nursing his chafed ankle , and indulging in certain moral reflections on the consul and captain guy . after laughing her fill at him , she condescended to notice the rest ; glancing from one to another in the most methodical and provoking manner imaginable . whenever anything struck her comically , you saw it like a flash—her finger levelled instantaneously , and , flinging herself back , she gave loose to strange , hollow little notes of laughter , that sounded like the bass of a music-box , playing a lively air with the lid down .
melville	omoo	now , i knew not that there was anything in my own appearance calculated to disarm ridicule ; and indeed , to have looked at all heroic , under the circumstances , would have been rather difficult . still , i could not but feel exceedingly annoyed at the prospect of being screamed at , in turn , by this mischievous young witch , even though she were but an islander . and , to tell a secret , her beauty had something to do with this sort of feeling ; and , pinioned as i was to a log , and clad most unbecomingly , i began to grow sentimental .
melville	omoo	ere her glance fell upon me , i had , unconsciously , thrown myself into the most graceful attitude i could assume , leaned my head upon my hand , and summoned up as abstracted an expression as possible . though my face was averted , i soon felt it flush , and knew that the glance was on me ; deeper and deeper grew the flush , and not a sound of laughter .
melville	omoo	delicious thought ! she was moved at the sight of me . i could stand it no longer , but started up . lo ! there she was ; her great hazel eyes rounding and rounding in her head , like two stars , her whole frame in a merry quiver , and an expression about the mouth that was sudden and violent death to anything like sentiment .
melville	omoo	the next moment she spun round , and , bursting from peal to peal of laughter , went racing out of the calabooza ; and , in mercy to me , never returned . chapter xxxiv . life at the calabooza
melville	omoo	a few days passed ; and , at last , our docility was rewarded by some indulgence on the part of captain bob . he allowed the entire party to be at large during the day ; only enjoining upon us always to keep within hail . this , to be sure , was in positive disobedience to wilson ’ s orders ; and so , care had to be taken that he should not hear of it . there was little fear of the natives telling him ; but strangers travelling the broom road might . by way of precaution , boys were stationed as scouts along the road . at sight of a white man , they sounded the alarm ! when we all made for our respective holes ( the stocks being purposely left open ) : the beam then descended , and we were prisoners . as soon as the traveller was out of sight , of course , we were liberated .
melville	omoo	notwithstanding the regular supply of food which we obtained from captain bob and his friends , it was so small that we often felt most intolerably hungry . we could not blame them for not bringing us more , for we soon became aware that they had to pinch themselves in order to give us what they did ; besides , they received nothing for their kindness but the daily bucket of bread .
melville	omoo	among a people like the tahitians , what we call “ hard times ” can only be experienced in the scarcity of edibles ; yet , so destitute are many of the common people that this most distressing consequence of civilization may be said , with them , to be ever present . to be sure , the natives about the calabooza had abundance of limes and oranges ; but what were these good for , except to impart a still keener edge to appetites which there was so little else to gratify ? during the height of the bread-fruit season , they fare better ; but , at other times , the demands of the shipping exhaust the uncultivated resources of the island ; and the lands being mostly owned by the chiefs , the inferior orders have to suffer for their cupidity . deprived of their nets , many of them would starve .
melville	omoo	as captain bob insensibly remitted his watchfulness , and we began to stroll farther and farther from the calabooza , we managed , by a systematic foraging upon the country round about , to make up some of our deficiencies . and fortunate it was that the houses of the wealthier natives were just as open to us as those of the most destitute ; we were treated as kindly in one as the other .
melville	omoo	once in a while , we came in at the death of a chiefs pig ; the noise of whose slaughtering was generally to be heard at a great distance . an occasion like this gathers the neighbours together , and they have a bit of a feast , where a stranger is always welcome . a good loud squeal , therefore , was music in our ears . it showed something going on in that direction .
melville	omoo	breaking in upon the party tumultuously , as we did , we always created a sensation . sometimes , we found the animal still alive and struggling ; in which case , it was generally dropped at our approach .
melville	omoo	to provide for these emergencies , flash jack generally repaired to the scene of operations with a sheath-knife between his teeth , and a club in his hand . others were exceedingly officious in singeing off the bristles , and disembowelling . doctor long ghost and myself , however , never meddled with these preliminaries , but came to the feast itself with unimpaired energies .
melville	omoo	like all lank men , my long friend had an appetite of his own . others occasionally went about seeking what they might devour , but he was always on the alert . he had an ingenious way of obviating an inconvenience which we all experienced at times . the islanders seldom use salt with their food ; so he begged rope yarn to bring him some from the ship ; also a little pepper , if he could ; which , accordingly , was done . this he placed in a small leather wallet—a “ monkey bag ” ( so called by sailors ) —usually worn as a purse about the neck .
melville	omoo	“ in my opinion , ” said long ghost , as he tucked the wallet out of sight , “ it behooves a stranger , in tahiti , to have his knife in readiness , and his castor slung . ”
melville	omoo	chapter xxxv . visit from an old acquaintance we had not been many days ashore , when doctor johnson was espied coming along the broom road . we had heard that he meditated a visit , and suspected what he was after . being upon the consul ’ s hands , all our expenses were of course payable by him in his official capacity ; and , therefore , as a friend of wilson , and sure of good pay , the shore doctor had some idea of allowing us to run up a bill with him . true , it was rather awkward to ask us to take medicines which , on board the ship , he told us were not needed . however , he resolved to put a bold face on the matter , and give us a call .
melville	omoo	his approach was announced by one of the scouts , upon which someone suggested that we should let him enter , and then put him in the stocks . but long ghost proposed better sport . what it was , we shall presently see .
melville	omoo	very bland and amiable , doctor johnson advanced , and , resting his cane on the stocks , glanced to right and left , as we lay before him . “ well , my lads ” —he began— “ how do you find yourselves to-day ? ”
melville	omoo	looking very demure , the men made some rejoinder ; and he went on . “ those poor fellows i saw the other day—the sick , i mean—how are they ? ” and he scrutinized the company . at last , he singled out one who was assuming a most unearthly appearance , and remarked that he looked as if he were extremely ill. “ yes , ” said the sailor dolefully , “ i ’ m afeard , doctor , i ’ ll soon be losing the number of my mess ! ” ( a sea phrase , for departing this life ) and he closed his eyes , and moaned .
melville	omoo	“ what does he say ? ” said johnson , turning round eagerly . “ why , ” exclaimed flash jack , who volunteered as interpreter , “ he means he ’ s going to croak ” ( die ) . “ croak ! and what does that mean , applied to a patient ? ”
melville	omoo	“ oh ! i understand , ” said he , when the word was explained ; and he stepped over the stocks , and felt the man ’ s pulse . “ what ’ s his name ? ” he asked , turning this time to old navy bob .
melville	omoo	“ we calls him jingling joe , ” replied that worthy . “ well then , men , you must take good care of poor joseph ; and i will send him a powder , which must be taken according to the directions . some of you know how to read , i presume ? ”
melville	omoo	“ that ere young cove does , ” replied bob , pointing toward the place where i lay , as if he were directing attention to a sail at sea . after examining the rest—some of whom were really invalids , but convalescent , and others only pretending to be labouring under divers maladies , johnson turned round , and addressed the party .
melville	omoo	“ men , ” said he , “ if any more of you are ailing , speak up , and let me know . by order of the consul , i ’ m to call every day ; so if any of you are at all sick , it ’ s my duty to prescribe for you . this sudden change from ship fare to shore living plays the deuce with you sailors , so be cautious about eating fruit . good-day ! i ’ ll send you the medicines the first thing in the morning . ”
melville	omoo	now , i am inclined to suspect that with all his want of understanding , johnson must have had some idea that we were quizzing him . still , that was nothing , so long as it answered his purpose ; and therefore , if he did see through us , he never showed it .
melville	omoo	sure enough , at the time appointed , along came a native lad with a small basket of cocoa-nut stalks , filled with powders , pill-boxes , and-vials , each with names and directions written in a large , round hand . the sailors , one and all , made a snatch at the collection , under the strange impression that some of the vials were seasoned with spirits . but , asserting his privilege as physician to the first reading of the labels , doctor long ghost was at last permitted to take possession of the basket .
melville	omoo	the first thing lighted upon was a large vial , labelled— “ for william—rub well in. ” this vial certainly had a spirituous smell ; and upon handing it to the patient , he made a summary internal application of its contents . the doctor looked aghast .
melville	omoo	there was now a mighty commotion . powders and pills were voted mere drugs in the market , and the holders of vials were pronounced lucky dogs . johnson must have known enough of sailors to make some of his medicines palatable—this , at least , long ghost suspected . certain it was , everyone took to the vials ; if at all spicy , directions were unheeded , their contents all going one road .
melville	omoo	the largest one of all , quite a bottle indeed , and having a sort of burnt brandy odour , was labelled— “ for daniel , drink freely , and until relieved. ” this black dan proceeded to do ; and would have made an end of it at once , had not the bottle , after a hard struggle , been snatched from his hands , and passed round , like a jovial decanter . the old tar had complained of the effects of an immoderate eating of fruit .
melville	omoo	upon calling the following morning , our physician found his precious row of patients reclining behind the stocks , and doing “ as well as could be expected. ” but the pills and powders were found to have been perfectly inactive : probably because none had been taken . to make them efficacious , it was suggested that , for the future , a bottle of pisco should be sent along with them . according to flash jack ’ s notions , unmitigated medical compounds were but dry stuff at the best , and needed something good to wash them down .
melville	omoo	thus far , our own m.d. , doctor long ghost , after starting the frolic , had taken no further part in it ; but on the physician ’ s third visit , he took him to one side , and had a private confabulation . what it was , exactly , we could not tell ; but from certain illustrative signs and gestures , i fancied that he was describing the symptoms of some mysterious disorganization of the vitals , which must have come on within the hour . assisted by his familiarity with medical terms , he seemed to produce a marked impression . at last , johnson went his way , promising aloud that he would send long ghost what he desired .
melville	omoo	when the medicine boy came along the following morning , the doctor was the first to accost him , walking off with a small purple vial . this time , there was little else in the basket but a case-bottle of the burnt brandy cordial , which , after much debate , was finally disposed of by someone pouring the contents , little by little , into the half of a cocoa-nut shell , and so giving all who desired a glass . no further medicinal cheer remaining , the men dispersed .
melville	omoo	an hour or two passed , when flash jack directed attention to my long friend , who , since the medicine boy left , had not been noticed till now . with eyes closed , he was lying behind the stocks , and jack was lifting his arm and letting it fall as if life were extinct . on running up with the rest , i at once connected the phenomenon with the mysterious vial . searching his pocket , i found it , and holding it up , it proved to be laudanum . flash jack , snatching it from my hand in a rapture , quickly informed all present what it was ; and with much glee , proposed a nap for the company . some of them not comprehending him exactly , the apparently defunct long ghost—who lay so still that i a little suspected the genuineness of his sleep—was rolled about as an illustration of the virtues of the vial ’ s contents . the idea tickled everybody mightily ; and throwing themselves down , the magic draught was passed from hand to hand . thinking that , as a matter of course , they must at once become insensible , each man , upon taking his sip , fell back , and closed his eyes .
melville	omoo	there was little fear of the result , since the narcotic was equally distributed . but , curious to see how it would operate , i raised myself gently after a while , and looked around . it was about noon , and perfectly still ; and as we all daily took the siesta , i was not much surprised to find everyone quiet . still , in one or two instances , i thought i detected a little peeping .
melville	omoo	presently , i heard a footstep , and saw doctor johnson approaching . and perplexed enough did he look at the sight of his prostrate file of patients , plunged , apparently , in such unaccountable slumbers .
melville	omoo	“ daniel , ” he cried , at last , punching in the side with his cane the individual thus designated— “ daniel , my good fellow , get up ! do you hear ? ” but black dan was immovable ; and he poked the next sleeper .
melville	omoo	“ joseph , joseph ! come , wake up ! it ’ s me , doctor johnson. ” but jingling joe , with mouth open , and eyes shut , was not to be started . “ bless my soul ! ” he exclaimed , with uplifted hands and cane , “ what ’ s got into ’ em ? i say , men ” —he shouted , running up and down— “ come to life , men ! what under the sun ’ s the matter with you ? ” and he struck the stocks , and bawled with increased vigour .
melville	omoo	at last he paused , folded his hands over the head of his cane , and steadfastly gazed upon us . the notes of the nasal orchestra were rising and falling upon his ear , and a new idea suggested itself .
melville	omoo	“ yes , yes ; the rascals must have been getting boozy . well , it ’ s none of my business—i ’ ll be off ; ” and off he went . no sooner was he out of sight , than nearly all started to their feet , and a hearty laugh ensued .
melville	omoo	like myself , most of them had been watching the event from under a sly eyelid . by this time , too , doctor long ghost was as wide awake as anybody . what were his reasons for taking laudanum , —if , indeed , he took any whatever , —is best known to himself ; and , as it is neither mine nor the reader ’ s business , we will say no more about it .
melville	omoo	chapter xxxvi . we are carried before the consul and captain we had been inmates of the calabooza beretanee about two weeks , when , one morning , captain bob , coming from the bath , in a state of utter nudity , brought into the building an armful of old tappa , and began to dress to go out .
melville	omoo	the operation was quite simple . the tappa—of the coarsest kind—was in one long , heavy piece ; and , fastening one end to a column of habiscus wood supporting the calabooza , he went off a few paces , and putting the other about his waist , wound himself right up to the post . this unique costume , in rotundity something like a farthingale , added immensely to his large hulk ; so much so that he fairly waddled in his gait . but he was only adhering to the fashion of his fathers ; for , in the olden time , the “ kihee , ” or big girdle , was quite the mode for both sexes . bob , despising recent innovations , still clung to it . he was a gentleman of the old school—one of the last of the kihees .
melville	omoo	he now told us that he had orders to take us before the consul . nothing loth , we formed in procession ; and , with the old man at our head , sighing and labouring like an engine , and flanked by a guard of some twenty natives , we started for the village .
melville	omoo	arrived at the consular office , we found wilson there , and four or five europeans , seated in a row facing us ; probably with the view of presenting as judicial an appearance as possible .
melville	omoo	on one side was a couch , where captain guy reclined . he looked convalescent ; and , as we found out , intended soon to go aboard his ship . he said nothing , but left everything to the consul .
melville	omoo	the latter now rose , and , drawing forth a paper from a large roll tied with red tape , commenced reading aloud . it purported to be , “ the affidavit of john jennin , first officer of the british colonial barque julia ; guy , master ; ” and proved to be a long statement of matters , from the time of leaving sydney , down to our arrival in the harbour . though artfully drawn up so as to bear hard against every one of us , it was pretty correct in the details ; excepting that it was wholly silent as to the manifold derelictions of the mate himself—a fact which imparted unusual significance to the concluding sentence , “ and furthermore , this deponent sayeth not . ”
melville	omoo	no comments were made , although we all looked round for the mate to see whether it was possible that he could have authorized this use of his name . but he was not present .
melville	omoo	the next document produced was the deposition of the captain himself . as on all other occasions , however , he had very little to say for himself , and it was soon set aside .
melville	omoo	the third affidavit was that of the seamen remaining aboard the vessel , including the traitor bungs , who , it seemed , had turned ship ’ s evidence . it was an atrocious piece of exaggeration , from beginning to end ; and those who signed it could not have known what they were about . certainly wymontoo did not , though his mark was there . in vain the consul commanded silence during the reading of this paper ; comments were shouted out upon every paragraph .
melville	omoo	the affidavits read , wilson , who , all the while , looked as stiff as a poker , solemnly drew forth the ship ’ s articles from their tin case . this document was a discoloured , musty , bilious-looking affair , and hard to read . when finished , the consul held it up ; and , pointing to the marks of the ship ’ s company , at the bottom , asked us , one by one , whether we acknowledged the same for our own .
melville	omoo	“ what ’ s the use of asking that ? ” said black dan ; “ captain guy there knows as well as we they are. ” “ silence , sir ! ” said wilson , who , intending to produce a suitable impression by this ridiculous parade , was not a little mortified by the old sailor ’ s bluntness .
melville	omoo	a pause of a few moments now ensued ; during which the bench of judges communed with captain guy , in a low tone , and the sailors canvassed the motives of the consul in having the affidavits taken .
melville	omoo	the general idea seemed to be that it was done with a view of “ bouncing , ” or frightening us into submission . such proved to be the case ; for wilson , rising to his feet again , addressed us as follows : —
melville	omoo	“ you see , men , that every preparation has been made to send you to sydney for trial . the rosa ( a small australian schooner , lying in the harbour ) will sail for that place in the course of ten days , at farthest . the julia sails on a cruise this day week . do you still refuse duty ? ”
melville	omoo	we did . hereupon the consul and captain exchanged glances ; and the latter looked bitterly disappointed . presently i noticed guy ’ s eye upon me ; and , for the first time , he spoke , and told me to come near . i stepped forward .
melville	omoo	“ was it not you that was taken off the island ? ” “ it was. ” “ it was you then who owe your life to my humanity . yet this is the gratitude of a sailor , mr. wilson ! ”
melville	omoo	“ not so , sir. ” and i at once gave him to understand that i was perfectly acquainted with his motives in sending a boat into the bay ; his crew was reduced , and he merely wished to procure the sailor whom he expected to find there . the ship was the means of my deliverance , and no thanks to the benevolence of its captain .
melville	omoo	doctor long ghost also had a word to say . in two masterly sentences he summed up captain guy ’ s character , to the complete satisfaction of every seaman present . matters were now growing serious ; especially as the sailors became riotous , and talked about taking the consul and the captain back to the calabooza with them .
melville	omoo	the other judges fidgeted , and loudly commanded silence . it was at length restored ; when wilson , for the last time addressing us , said something more about the rose and sydney , and concluded by reminding us that a week would elapse ere the julia sailed .
melville	omoo	leaving these hints to operate for themselves , he dismissed the party , ordering captain bob and his friends to escort us back whence we came . chapter xxxvii . the french priests pay their respects
melville	omoo	a day or two after the events just related , we were lounging in the calabooza beretanee , when we were honoured by a visit from three of the french priests ; and as about the only notice ever taken of us by the english missionaries was their leaving their cards for us , in the shape of a package of tracts , we could not help thinking that the frenchmen , in making a personal call , were at least much better bred .
melville	omoo	by this time they had settled themselves down quite near our habitation . a pleasant little stroll down the broom road , and a rustic cross peeped through the trees ; and soon you came to as charming a place as one would wish to see : a soft knoll , planted with old breadfruit trees ; in front , a savannah , sloping to a grove of palms , and , between these , glimpses of blue , sunny waves .
melville	omoo	on the summit of the knoll was a rude chapel , of bamboos ; quite small , and surmounted by the cross . between the canes , at nightfall , the natives stole peeps at a small portable altar ; a crucifix to correspond , and gilded candlesticks and censers . their curiosity carried them no further ; nothing could induce them to worship there . such queer ideas as they entertained of the hated strangers . masses and chants were nothing more than evil spells . as for the priests themselves , they were no better than diabolical sorcerers ; like those who , in old times , terrified their fathers .
melville	omoo	close by the chapel was a range of native houses ; rented from a chief , and handsomely furnished . here lived the priests ; and very comfortably , too . they looked sanctimonious enough abroad ; but that went for nothing ; since , at home , in their retreat , they were a club of friar tucks ; holding priestly wassail over many a good cup of red brandy , and rising late in the morning .
melville	omoo	pity it was they couldn ’ t marry—pity for the ladies of the island , i mean , and the cause of morality ; for what business had the ecclesiastical old bachelors with such a set of trim little native handmaidens ? these damsels were their first converts ; and devoted ones they were .
melville	omoo	the priests , as i have said before , were accounted necromancers : the appearance of two of our three visitors might have justified the conceit . they were little , dried-up frenchmen , in long , straight gowns of black cloth , and unsightly three-cornered hats—so preposterously big that , in putting them on , the reverend fathers seemed to extinguish themselves .
melville	omoo	their companion was dressed differently . he wore a sort of yellow , flannel morning gown , and a broad-brimmed manilla hat . large and portly , he was also hale and fifty ; with a complexion like an autumnal leaf—handsome blue eyes—fine teeth , and a racy milesian brogue . in short , he was an irishman ; father murphy , by name ; and , as such , pretty well known , and very thoroughly disliked , throughout all the protestant missionary settlements in polynesia . in early youth , he had been sent to a religious seminary in france ; and , taking orders there , had but once or twice afterwards revisited his native land .
melville	omoo	father murphy marched up to us briskly ; and the first words he uttered were , to ask whether there were any of his countrymen among us . there were two of them ; one , a lad of sixteen—a bright , curly-headed rascal—and , being a young irishman , of course , his name was pat . the other was an ugly , and rather melancholy-looking scamp ; one m ’ gee , whose prospects in life had been blasted by a premature transportation to sydney . this was the report , at least , though it might have been scandal .
melville	omoo	in most of my shipmates were some redeeming qualities ; but about m ’ gee , there was nothing of the kind ; and forced to consort with him , i could not help regretting , a thousand times , that the gallows had been so tardy . as if impelled , against her will , to send him into the world , nature had done all she could to insure his being taken for what he was . about the eyes there was no mistaking him ; with a villainous cast in one , they seemed suspicious of each other .
melville	omoo	glancing away from him at once , the bluff priest rested his gaze on the good-humoured face of pat , who , with a pleasant roguishness , was “ twigging ” the enormous hats ( or “ hytee belteezers , ” as land beavers are called by sailors ) , from under which , like a couple of snails , peeped the two little frenchmen .
melville	omoo	pat and the priest were both from the same town in meath ; and , when this was found out , there was no end to the questions of the latter . to him , pat seemed a letter from home , and said a hundred times as much .
melville	omoo	after a long talk between these two , and a little broken english from the frenchmen , our visitors took leave ; but father murphy had hardly gone a dozen rods when back he came , inquiring whether we were in want of anything .
melville	omoo	“ yes , ” cried one , “ something to eat. ” upon this he promised to send us some fresh wheat bread , of his own baking ; a great luxury in tahiti . we all felicitated pat upon picking up such a friend , and told him his fortune was made .
melville	omoo	the next morning , a french servant of the priest ’ s made his appearance with a small bundle of clothing for our young hibernian ; and the promised bread for the party . pat being out at the knees and elbows , and , like the rest of us , not full inside , the present was acceptable all round .
melville	omoo	in the afternoon , father murphy himself came along ; and , in addition to his previous gifts , gave pat a good deal of advice : said he was sorry to see him in limbo , and that he would have a talk with the consul about having him set free .
melville	omoo	we saw nothing more of him for two or three days ; at the end of which time he paid us another call , telling pat that wilson was inexorable , having refused to set him at liberty , unless to go aboard the ship . this , the priest now besought him to do forthwith ; and so escape the punishment which , it seems , wilson had been hinting at to his intercessor . pat , however , was staunch against entreaties ; and , with all the ardour of a sophomorean sailor , protested his intention to hold out to the last . with none of the meekness of a good little boy about him , the blunt youngster stormed away at such a rate that it was hard to pacify him ; and the priest said no more .
melville	omoo	how it came to pass—whether from murphy ’ s speaking to the consul , or otherwise , we could not tell—but the next day , pat was sent for by wilson , and being escorted to the village by our good old keeper , three days elapsed before he returned .
melville	omoo	bent upon reclaiming him , they had taken him on board the ship ; feasted him in the cabin ; and , finding that of no avail , down they thrust him into the hold , in double irons , and on bread and water . all would not do ; and so he was sent back to the calabooza . boy that he was , they must have counted upon his being more susceptible to discipline than the rest .
melville	omoo	the interest felt in pat ’ s welfare , by his benevolent countryman , was very serviceable to the rest of us ; especially as we all turned catholics , and went to mass every morning , much to captain bob ’ s consternation . upon finding it out , he threatened to keep us in the stocks if we did not desist . he went no farther than this , though ; and so , every few days , we strolled down to the priest ’ s residence , and had a mouthful to eat , and something generous to drink . in particular , dr. long ghost and myself became huge favourites with pat ’ s friend ; and many a time he regaled us from a quaint-looking travelling case for spirits , stowed away in one corner of his dwelling . it held four square flasks , which , somehow or other , always contained just enough to need emptying . in truth , the fine old irishman was a rosy fellow in canonicals . his countenance and his soul were always in a glow . it may be ungenerous to reveal his failings , but he often talked thick , and sometimes was perceptibly eccentric in his gait .
melville	omoo	i never drink french brandy but i pledge father murphy . his health again ! and many jolly proselytes may he make in polynesia ! chapter xxxviii . little julia sails without us to make good the hint thrown out by the consul upon the conclusion of the farce of the affidavits , we were again brought before him within the time specified .
melville	omoo	it was the same thing over again : he got nothing out of us , and we were remanded ; our resolute behaviour annoying him prodigiously . what we observed led us to form the idea that , on first learning the state of affairs on board the julia , wilson must have addressed his invalid friend , the captain , something in the following style :
melville	omoo	“ guy , my poor fellow , don ’ t worry yourself now about those rascally sailors of yours . i ’ ll dress them out for you—just leave it all to me , and set your mind at rest . ”
melville	omoo	but handcuffs and stocks , big looks , threats , dark hints , and depositions , had all gone for nought . conscious that , as matters now stood , nothing serious could grow out of what had happened ; and never dreaming that our being sent home for trial had ever been really thought of , we thoroughly understood wilson , and laughed at him accordingly .
melville	omoo	since leaving the julia , we had caught no glimpse of the mate ; but we often heard of him . it seemed that he remained on board , keeping house in the cabin for himself and viner ; who , going to see him according to promise , was induced to remain a guest . these two cronies now had fine times ; tapping the captain ’ s quarter-casks , playing cards on the transom , and giving balls of an evening to the ladies ashore . in short , they cut up so many queer capers that the missionaries complained of them to the consul ; and jermin received a sharp reprimand .
melville	omoo	this so affected him that he still drank more freely than before ; and one afternoon , when mellow as a grape , he took umbrage at a canoe full of natives , who , on being hailed from the deck to come aboard and show their papers , got frightened , and paddled for the shore .
melville	omoo	lowering a boat instantly , he equipped wymontoo and the dane with a cutlass apiece , and seizing another himself , off they started in pursuit , the ship ’ s ensign flying in the boat ’ s stern . the alarmed islanders , beaching their canoe , with loud cries fled through the village , the mate after them , slashing his naked weapon to right and left . a crowd soon collected ; and the “ karhowree toonee , ” or crazy stranger , was quickly taken before wilson .
melville	omoo	now , it so chanced that , in a native house hard by , the consul and captain guy were having a quiet game at cribbage by themselves , a decanter on the table standing sentry . the obstreperous jermin was brought in ; and finding the two thus pleasantly occupied , it had a soothing effect upon him ; and he insisted upon taking a hand at the cards , and a drink of the brandy . as the consul was nearly as tipsy as himself , and the captain dared not object for fear of giving offence , at it they went—all three of them—and made a night of it ; the mate ’ s delinquencies being summarily passed over , and his captors sent away .
melville	omoo	an incident worth relating grew out of this freak . there wandered about papeetee , at this time , a shrivelled little fright of an englishwoman , known among sailors as “ old mother tot. ” from new zealand to the sandwich islands , she had been all over the south seas ; keeping a rude hut of entertainment for mariners , and supplying them with rum and dice . upon the missionary islands , of course , such conduct was severely punishable ; and at various places , mother tot ’ s establishment had been shut up , and its proprietor made to quit in the first vessel that could be hired to land her elsewhere . but , with a perseverance invincible , wherever she went she always started afresh ; and so became notorious everywhere .
melville	omoo	by some wicked spell of hers , a patient , one-eyed little cobbler followed her about , mending shoes for white men , doing the old woman ’ s cooking , and bearing all her abuse without grumbling . strange to relate , a battered bible was seldom out of his sight ; and whenever he had leisure , and his mistress ’ back was turned , he was forever poring over it . this pious propensity used to enrage the old crone past belief ; and oftentimes she boxed his ears with the book , and tried to burn it . mother tot and her man josy were , indeed , a curious pair .
melville	omoo	but to my story . a week or so after our arrival in the harbour , the old lady had once again been hunted down , and forced for the time to abandon her nefarious calling . this was brought about chiefly by wilson , who , for some reason unknown , had contracted the most violent hatred for her ; which , on her part , was more than reciprocated .
melville	omoo	well : passing , in the evening , where the consul and his party were making merry , she peeped through the bamboos of the house ; and straightway resolved to gratify her spite . the night was very dark ; and providing herself with a huge ship ’ s lantern , which usually swung in her hut , she waited till they came forth . this happened about midnight ; wilson making his appearance , supported by two natives , holding him up by the arms . these three went first ; and just as they got under a deep shade , a bright light was thrust within an inch of wilson ’ s nose . the old hag was kneeling before him , holding the lantern with uplifted hands .
melville	omoo	“ ha , ha ! my fine counsellor , ” she shrieked ; “ ye persecute a lone old body like me for selling rum—do ye ? and here ye are , carried home drunk—hoot ! ye villain , i scorn ye ! ” and she spat upon him .
melville	omoo	terrified at the apparition , the poor natives—arrant believers in ghosts—dropped the trembling consul , and fled in all directions . after giving full vent to her rage , mother tot hobbled away , and left the three revellers to stagger home the best way they could .
melville	omoo	the day following our last interview with wilson , we learned that captain guy had gone on board his vessel for the purpose of shipping a new crew . there was a round bounty offered ; and a heavy bag of spanish dollars , with the julia ’ s articles ready for signing , were laid on the capstan-head .
melville	omoo	now , there was no lack of idle sailors ashore , mostly “ beachcombers , ” who had formed themselves into an organized gang , headed by one mack , a scotchman , whom they styled the commodore . by the laws of the fraternity , no member was allowed to ship on board a vessel unless granted permission by the rest . in this way the gang controlled the port , all discharged seamen being forced to join them .
melville	omoo	to mack and his men our story was well known ; indeed , they had several times called to see us ; and of course , as sailors and congenial spirits , they were hard against captain guy .
melville	omoo	deeming the matter important , they came in a body to the calabooza , and wished to know whether , all things considered , we thought it best for any of them to join the julia .
melville	omoo	anxious to pack the ship off as soon as possible , we answered , by all means . some went so far as to laud the julia to the skies as the best and fastest of ships . jermin too , as a good fellow , and a sailor every inch , came in for his share of praise ; and as for the captain—quiet man , he would never trouble anyone . in short , every inducement we could think of was presented ; and flash jack ended by assuring the beachcombers solemnly that , now we were all well and hearty , nothing but a regard to principle prevented us from returning on board ourselves .
melville	omoo	the result was that a new crew was finally obtained , together with a steady new englander for second mate , and three good whalemen for harpooners . in part , what was wanting for the ship ’ s larder was also supplied ; and as far as could be done in a place like tahiti , the damages the vessel had sustained were repaired . as for the mowree , the authorities refusing to let him be put ashore , he was carried to sea in irons , down in the hold . what eventually became of him we never heard .
melville	omoo	ropey , poor poor ropey , who a few days previous had fallen sick , was left ashore at the sailor hospital at townor , a small place upon the beach between papeetee and matavai . here , some time after , he breathed his last . no one knew his complaint : he must have died of hard times . several of us saw him interred in the sand , and i planted a rude post to mark his resting-place .
melville	omoo	the cooper , and the rest who had remained aboard from the first , of course , composed part of the julia ’ s new crew . to account for the conduct , all along , of the consul and captain , in trying so hard to alter our purpose with respect to the ship , the following statement is all that is requisite . beside an advance of from fifteen to twenty-five dollars demanded by every sailor shipping at tahiti , an additional sum for each man so shipped has to be paid into the hands of the government , as a charge of the port . beside this , the men—with here and there an exception—will only ship for one cruise , thus becoming entitled to a discharge before the vessel reaches home ; which , in time , creates the necessity of obtaining other men , at a similar cost . now , the julia ’ s exchequer was at low-water mark , or rather , it was quite empty ; and to meet these expenses , a good part of what little oil there was aboard had to be sold for a song to a merchant of papeetee .
melville	omoo	it was sunday in tahiti and a glorious morning , when captain bob , waddling into the calabooza , startled us by announcing “ ah—my boy—shippy you , harre—maky sail ! ” in other words , the julia was off .
melville	omoo	the beach was quite near , and in this quarter altogether uninhabited ; so down we ran , and , at cable ’ s length , saw little jule gliding past—top-gallant-sails hoisting , and a boy aloft with one leg thrown over the yard , loosing the fore-royal . the decks were all life and commotion ; the sailors on the forecastle singing “ ho , cheerly men ! ” as they catted the anchor ; and the gallant jennin , bare-headed as his wont , standing up on the bowsprit , and issuing his orders . by the man at the helm stood captain guy , very quiet and gentlemanly , and smoking a cigar .
melville	omoo	soon the ship drew near the reef , and , altering her course , glided out through the break , and went on her way . thus disappeared little jule , about three weeks after entering the harbour : and nothing more have i ever heard of her .
melville	omoo	chapter xxxix . jermin serves us a good turn—friendships in polynesia the ship out of the way , we were quite anxious to know what was going to be done with us . on this head , captain bob could tell us nothing ; no further , at least , than that he still considered himself responsible for our safe-keeping . however , he never put us to bed any more ; and we had everything our own way .
melville	omoo	the day after the julia left , the old man came up to us in great tribulation , saying that the bucket of bread was no longer forthcoming , and that wilson had refused to send anything in its place . one and all , we took this for a hint to disperse quietly , and go about our business . nevertheless , we were not to be shaken off so easily ; and taking a malicious pleasure in annoying our old enemy , we resolved , for the present , to stay where we were . for the part he had been acting , we learned that the consul was the laughing-stock of all the foreigners ashore , who frequently twitted him upon his hopeful proteges of the calabooza beretanee .
melville	omoo	as we were wholly without resources , so long as we remained on the island no better place than captain bob ’ s could be selected for an abiding-place . beside , we heartily loved the old gentleman , and could not think of leaving him ; so , telling him to give no thought as to wherewithal we should be clothed and fed , we resolved , by extending and systematizing our foraging operations , to provide for ourselves .
melville	omoo	we were greatly assisted by a parting legacy of jermin ’ s . to him we were indebted for having all our chests sent ashore , and everything left therein . they were placed in the custody of a petty chief living near by , who was instructed by the consul not to allow them to be taken away ; but we might call and make our toilets whenever we pleased .
melville	omoo	we went to see mahinee , the old chief ; captain bob going along , and stoutly insisting upon having the chattels delivered up . at last this was done ; and in solemn procession the chests were borne by the natives to the calabooza . here , we disposed them about quite tastefully ; and made such a figure that , in the eyes of old bob and his friends , the calabooza beretanee was by far the most sumptuously furnished saloon in tahiti .
melville	omoo	indeed , so long as it remained thus furnished , the native courts of the district were held there ; the judge , mahinee , and his associates , sitting upon one of the chests , and the culprits and spectators thrown at full length upon the ground , both inside of the building and under the shade of the trees without ; while , leaning over the stocks as from a gallery , the worshipful crew of the julia looked on , and canvassed the proceedings .
melville	omoo	i should have mentioned before that , previous to the vessel ’ s departure , the men had bartered away all the clothing they could possibly spare ; but now , it was resolved to be more provident .
melville	omoo	the contents of the chests were of the most miscellaneous description : —sewing utensils , marling-spikes , strips of calico , bits of rope , jack-knives ; nearly everything , in short , that a seaman could think of . but of wearing apparel , there was little but old frocks , remnants of jackets , and legs of trousers , with now and then the foot of a stocking .
melville	omoo	these , however , were far from being valueless ; for , among the poorer tahitians , everything european is highly esteemed . they come from “ beretanee , fenooa pararee ” ( britain , land of wonders ) , and that is enough .
melville	omoo	the chests themselves were deemed exceedingly precious , especially those with unfractured looks , which would absolutely click , and enable the owner to walk off with the key . scars , however , and bruises , were considered great blemishes . one old fellow , smitten with the doctor ’ s large mahogany chest ( a well-filled one , by the bye ) , and finding infinite satisfaction in merely sitting thereon , was detected in the act of applying a healing ointment to a shocking scratch which impaired the beauty of the lid .
melville	omoo	there is no telling the love of a tahitian for a sailor ’ s trunk . so ornamental is it held as an article of furniture in the hut , that the women are incessantly tormenting their husbands to bestir themselves and make them a present of one . when obtained , no pier-table just placed in a drawing-room is regarded with half the delight . for these reasons , then , our coming into possession of our estate at this time was an important event .
melville	omoo	the islanders are much like the rest of the world ; and the news of our good fortune brought us troops of “ tayos , ” or friends , eager to form an alliance after the national custom , and do our slightest bidding .
melville	omoo	the really curious way in which all the polynesians are in the habit of making bosom friends at the shortest possible notice is deserving of remark . although , among a people like the tahitians , vitiated as they are by sophisticating influences , this custom has in most cases degenerated into a mere mercenary relation , it nevertheless had its origin in a fine , and in some instances , heroic sentiment , formerly entertained by their fathers .
melville	omoo	in the annals of the island are examples of extravagant friendships , unsurpassed by the story of damon and pythias : in truth , much more wonderful ; for , notwithstanding the devotion—even of life in some cases—to which they led , they were frequently entertained at first sight for some stranger from another island .
melville	omoo	filled with love and admiration for the first whites who came among them , the polynesians could not testify the warmth of their emotions more strongly than by instantaneously making their abrupt proffer of friendship . hence , in old voyages we read of chiefs coming off from the shore in their canoes , and going through with strange antics , expressive of the desire . in the same way , their inferiors accosted the seamen ; and thus the practice has continued in some islands down to the present day .
melville	omoo	there is a small place , not many days ’ sail from tahiti , and seldom visited by shipping , where the vessel touched to which i then happened to belong . of course , among the simple-hearted natives , we had a friend all round . mine was poky , a handsome youth , who never could do enough for me . every morning at sunrise , his canoe came alongside loaded with fruits of all kinds ; upon being emptied , it was secured by a line to the bowsprit , under which it lay all day long , ready at any time to carry its owner ashore on an errand .
melville	omoo	seeing him so indefatigable , i told poky one day that i was a virtuoso in shells and curiosities of all kinds . that was enough ; away he paddled for the head of the bay , and i never saw him again for twenty-four hours . the next morning , his canoe came gliding slowly along the shore with the full-leaved bough of a tree for a sail . for the purpose of keeping the things dry , he had also built a sort of platform just behind the prow , railed in with green wicker-work ; and here was a heap of yellow bananas and cowree shells ; young cocoa-nuts and antlers of red coral ; two or three pieces of carved wood ; a little pocket-idol , black as jet , and rolls of printed tappa .
melville	omoo	we were given a holiday ; and upon going ashore , poky , of course , was my companion and guide . for this , no mortal could be better qualified ; his native country was not large , and he knew every inch of it . gallanting me about , everyone was stopped and ceremoniously introduced to poky ’ s “ tayo karhowree nuee ” or his particular white friend .
melville	omoo	he showed me all the lions ; but more than all , he took me to see a charming lioness—a young damsel—the daughter of a chief—the reputation of whose charms had spread to the neighbouring islands , and even brought suitors therefrom . among these was tooboi , the heir of tamatory , king of eaiatair , one of the society isles . the girl was certainly fair to look upon . many heavens were in her sunny eyes ; and the outline of that arm of hers , peeping forth from a capricious tappa robe , was the very curve of beauty .
melville	omoo	though there was no end to poky ’ s attentions , not a syllable did he ever breathe of reward ; but sometimes he looked very knowing . at last the day came for sailing , and with it , also , his canoe , loaded down to the gunwale with a sea stock of fruits . giving him all i could spare from my chest , i went on deck to take my place at the windlass ; for the anchor was weighing . poky followed , and heaved with me at the same handspike .
melville	omoo	the anchor was soon up ; and away we went out of the bay with more than twenty shallops towing astern . at last they left us ; but long as i could see him at all , there was poky , standing alone and motionless in the bow of his canoe .
melville	omoo	part ii chapter xl . we take unto ourselves friends the arrival of the chests made my friend , the doctor , by far the wealthiest man of the party . so much the better for me , seeing that i had little or nothing myself ; though , from our intimacy , the natives courted my favour almost as much as his .
melville	omoo	among others , kooloo was a candidate for my friendship ; and being a comely youth , quite a buck in his way , i accepted his overtures . by this , i escaped the importunities of the rest ; for be it known that , though little inclined to jealousy in love matters , the tahitian will hear of no rivals in his friendship .
melville	omoo	kooloo , running over his qualifications as a friend , first of all informed me that he was a “ mickonaree , ” thus declaring his communion with the church . the way this “ tayo ” of mine expressed his regard was by assuring me over and over again that the love he bore me was “ nuee , nuee , nuee , ” or infinitesimally extensive . all over these seas , the word “ nuee ” is significant of quantity . its repetition is like placing ciphers at the right hand of a numeral ; the more places you carry it out to , the greater the sum . judge , then , of kooloo ’ s esteem . nor is the allusion to the ciphers at all inappropriate , seeing that , in themselves , kooloo ’ s profession turned out to be worthless . he was , alas ! as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal ; one of those who make no music unless the clapper be silver .
melville	omoo	in the course of a few days , the sailors , like the doctor and myself , were cajoled out of everything , and our “ tayos , ” all round , began to cool off quite sensibly . so remiss did they become in their attentions that we could no longer rely upon their bringing us the daily supply of food , which all of them had faithfully promised .
melville	omoo	as for kooloo , after sponging me well , he one morning played the part of a retrograde lover ; informing me that his affections had undergone a change ; he had fallen in love at first sight with a smart sailor , who had just stepped ashore quite flush from a lucky whaling-cruise .
melville	omoo	it was a touching interview , and with it , our connection dissolved . but the sadness which ensued would soon have been dissipated , had not my sensibilities been wounded by his indelicately sporting some of my gifts very soon after this transfer of his affections . hardly a day passed that i did not meet him on the broom road , airing himself in a regatta shirt which i had given him in happier hours .
melville	omoo	he went by with such an easy saunter too , looking me pleasantly in the eye , and merely exchanging the cold salute of the road : — “ yar onor , boyoee , ” a mere sidewalk how d ’ ye do . after several experiences like this , i began to entertain a sort of respect for kooloo , as quite a man of the world . in good sooth , he turned out to be one ; in one week ’ s time giving me the cut direct , and lounging by without even nodding . he must have taken me for part of the landscape .
melville	omoo	before the chests were quite empty , we had a grand washing in the stream of our best raiment , for the purpose of looking tidy , and visiting the european chapel in the village . every sunday morning it is open for divine service , some member of the mission officiating . this was the first time we ever entered papeetee unattended by an escort .
melville	omoo	in the chapel there were about forty people present , including the officers of several ships in harbour . it was an energetic discourse , and the pulpit cushion was well pounded . occupying a high seat in the synagogue , and stiff as a flagstaff , was our beloved guardian , wilson . i shall never forget his look of wonder when his interesting wards filed in at the doorway , and took up a seat directly facing him .
melville	omoo	service over , we waited outside in hopes of seeing more of him ; but sorely annoyed at the sight of us , he reconnoitred from the window , and never came forth until we had started for home .
melville	omoo	chapter xli . we levy contributions on the shipping scarcely a week went by after the julia ’ s sailing , when , with the proverbial restlessness of sailors , some of the men began to grow weary of the calabooza beretanee , and resolved to go boldly among the vessels in the bay , and offer to ship .
melville	omoo	the thing was tried ; but though strongly recommended by the commodore of the beachcombers , in the end they were invariably told by the captains to whom they applied that they bore an equivocal character ashore , and would not answer . so often were they repulsed that we pretty nearly gave up all thoughts of leaving the island in this way ; and growing domestic again , settled down quietly at captain bob ’ s .
melville	omoo	it was about this time that the whaling-ships , which have their regular seasons for cruising , began to arrive at papeetee ; and of course their crews frequently visited us . this is customary all over the pacific . no sailor steps ashore , but he straightway goes to the “ calabooza , ” where he is almost sure to find some poor fellow or other in confinement for desertion , or alleged mutiny , or something of that sort . sympathy is proffered , and if need be , tobacco . the latter , however , is most in request ; as a solace to the captive , it is invaluable .
melville	omoo	having fairly carried the day against both consul and captain , we were objects of even more than ordinary interest to these philanthropists ; and they always cordially applauded our conduct . besides , they invariably brought along something in the way of refreshments ; occasionally smuggling in a little pisco . upon one occasion , when there was quite a number present , a calabash was passed round , and a pecuniary collection taken up for our benefit .
melville	omoo	one day a newcomer proposed that two or three of us should pay him a sly , nocturnal visit aboard his ship ; engaging to send us away well freighted with provisions . this was not a bad idea ; nor were we at all backward in acting upon it . right after night every vessel in the harbour was visited in rotation , the foragers borrowing captain bob ’ s canoe for the purpose . as we all took turns at this—two by two—in due course it came to long ghost and myself , for the sailors invariably linked us together . in such an enterprise , i somewhat distrusted the doctor , for he was no sailor , and very tall ; and a canoe is the most ticklish of navigable things . however , it could not be helped ; and so we went .
melville	omoo	but a word about the canoes before we go any further . among the society islands , the art of building them , like all native accomplishments , has greatly deteriorated ; and they are now the most inelegant , as well as the most insecure of any in the south seas . in cook ’ s time , according to his account , there was at tahiti a royal fleet of seventeen hundred and twenty large war canoes , handsomely carved , and otherwise adorned . at present , those used are quite small ; nothing more than logs hollowed out , sharpened at one end , and then launched into the water .
melville	omoo	to obviate a certain rolling propensity , the tahitians , like all polynesians , attach to them what sailors call an “ outrigger. ” it consists of a pole floating alongside , parallel to the canoe , and connected with it by a couple of cross sticks , a yard or more in length . thus equipped , the canoe can not be overturned , unless you overcome the buoyancy of the pole , or lift it entirely out of the water .
melville	omoo	now , captain bob ’ s “ gig ” was exceedingly small ; so small , and of such a grotesque shape , that the sailors christened it the pill box ; and by this appellation it always went . in fact , it was a sort of “ sulky , ” meant for a solitary paddler , but , on an emergency , capable of floating two or three . the outrigger was a mere switch , alternately rising in air , and then depressed in the water .
melville	omoo	assuming the command of the expedition , upon the strength of my being a sailor , i packed the long doctor with a paddle in the bow , and then shoving off , leaped into the stern ; thus leaving him to do all the work , and reserving to myself the dignified sinecure of steering . all would have gone on well , were it not that my paddler made such clumsy work that the water spattered , and showered down upon us without ceasing . continuing to ply his tool , however , quite energetically , i thought he would improve after a while , and so let him alone . but by and bye , getting wet through with this little storm we were raising , and seeing no signs of its clearing off , i conjured him , in mercy ’ s name , to stop short , and let me wring myself out . upon this , he suddenly turned round , when the canoe gave a roll , the outrigger flew overhead , and the next moment came rap on the doctor ’ s skull , and we were both in the water .
melville	omoo	fortunately , we were just over a ledge of coral , not half-a-fathom under the surface . depressing one end of the filled canoe , and letting go of it quickly , it bounced up , and discharged a great part of its contents ; so that we easily baled out the remainder , and again embarked . this time , my comrade coiled himself away in a very small space ; and enjoining upon him not to draw a single unnecessary breath , i proceeded to urge the canoe along by myself . i was astonished at his docility , never speaking a word , and stirring neither hand nor foot ; but the secret was , he was unable to swim , and in case we met with a second mishap , there were no more ledges beneath to stand upon . “ crowning ’ s but a shabby way of going out of the world , ” he exclaimed , upon my rallying him ; “ and i ’ m not going to be guilty of it . ”
melville	omoo	at last , the ship was at hand , and we approached with much caution , wishing to avoid being hailed by anyone from the quarter-deck . dropping silently under her bows , we heard a low whistle—the signal agreed upon—and presently a goodly-sized bag was lowered over to us .
melville	omoo	we cut the line , and then paddled away as fast as we could , and made the best of our way home . here , we found the rest waiting impatiently . the bag turned out to be well filled with sweet potatoes boiled , cubes of salt beef and pork , and a famous sailors ’ pudding , what they call “ duff , ” made of flour and water , and of about the consistence of an underdone brick . with these delicacies , and keen appetites , we went out into the moonlight , and had a nocturnal picnic .

shakespeare	romeo	lady capulet . what say you , can you love the gentleman ? this night you shall behold him at our feast ; read o ’ er the volume of young paris ’ face , and find delight writ there with beauty ’ s pen . examine every married lineament , and see how one another lends content ; and what obscur ’ d in this fair volume lies , find written in the margent of his eyes . this precious book of love , this unbound lover , to beautify him , only lacks a cover : the fish lives in the sea ; and ’ tis much pride for fair without the fair within to hide . that book in many ’ s eyes doth share the glory , that in gold clasps locks in the golden story ; so shall you share all that he doth possess , by having him , making yourself no less .
shakespeare	romeo	nurse . no less , nay bigger . women grow by men . lady capulet . speak briefly , can you like of paris ’ love ? juliet . i ’ ll look to like , if looking liking move : but no more deep will i endart mine eye than your consent gives strength to make it fly .

shakespeare	romeo	romeo . what , shall this speech be spoke for our excuse ? or shall we on without apology ? benvolio . the date is out of such prolixity : we ’ ll have no cupid hoodwink ’ d with a scarf , bearing a tartar ’ s painted bow of lath , scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper ; nor no without-book prologue , faintly spoke after the prompter , for our entrance : but let them measure us by what they will , we ’ ll measure them a measure , and be gone .
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . give me a torch , i am not for this ambling ; being but heavy i will bear the light . mercutio . nay , gentle romeo , we must have you dance . romeo . not i , believe me , you have dancing shoes , with nimble soles , i have a soul of lead so stakes me to the ground i can not move .
shakespeare	romeo	mercutio . you are a lover , borrow cupid ’ s wings , and soar with them above a common bound . romeo . i am too sore enpierced with his shaft to soar with his light feathers , and so bound , i can not bound a pitch above dull woe . under love ’ s heavy burden do i sink .
shakespeare	romeo	mercutio . and , to sink in it , should you burden love ; too great oppression for a tender thing . romeo . is love a tender thing ? it is too rough , too rude , too boisterous ; and it pricks like thorn .
shakespeare	romeo	mercutio . if love be rough with you , be rough with love ; prick love for pricking , and you beat love down . give me a case to put my visage in : [ _putting on a mask._ ] a visor for a visor . what care i what curious eye doth quote deformities ? here are the beetle-brows shall blush for me .
shakespeare	romeo	benvolio . come , knock and enter ; and no sooner in but every man betake him to his legs . romeo . a torch for me : let wantons , light of heart , tickle the senseless rushes with their heels ; for i am proverb ’ d with a grandsire phrase , i ’ ll be a candle-holder and look on , the game was ne ’ er so fair , and i am done .
shakespeare	romeo	mercutio . tut , dun ’ s the mouse , the constable ’ s own word : if thou art dun , we ’ ll draw thee from the mire or save your reverence love , wherein thou stickest up to the ears . come , we burn daylight , ho .
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . nay , that ’ s not so . mercutio . i mean sir , in delay we waste our lights in vain , light lights by day . take our good meaning , for our judgment sits five times in that ere once in our five wits .
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . and we mean well in going to this mask ; but ’ tis no wit to go . mercutio . why , may one ask ? romeo . i dreamt a dream tonight . mercutio . and so did i .
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . well what was yours ? mercutio . that dreamers often lie . romeo . in bed asleep , while they do dream things true . mercutio . o , then , i see queen mab hath been with you . she is the fairies ’ midwife , and she comes in shape no bigger than an agate-stone on the fore-finger of an alderman , drawn with a team of little atomies over men ’ s noses as they lie asleep : her waggon-spokes made of long spinners ’ legs ; the cover , of the wings of grasshoppers ; her traces , of the smallest spider ’ s web ; the collars , of the moonshine ’ s watery beams ; her whip of cricket ’ s bone ; the lash , of film ; her waggoner , a small grey-coated gnat , not half so big as a round little worm prick ’ d from the lazy finger of a maid : her chariot is an empty hazelnut , made by the joiner squirrel or old grub , time out o ’ mind the fairies ’ coachmakers . and in this state she gallops night by night through lovers ’ brains , and then they dream of love ; o ’ er courtiers ’ knees , that dream on curtsies straight ; o ’ er lawyers ’ fingers , who straight dream on fees ; o ’ er ladies ’ lips , who straight on kisses dream , which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues , because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are : sometime she gallops o ’ er a courtier ’ s nose , and then dreams he of smelling out a suit ; and sometime comes she with a tithe-pig ’ s tail , tickling a parson ’ s nose as a lies asleep , then dreams he of another benefice : sometime she driveth o ’ er a soldier ’ s neck , and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats , of breaches , ambuscados , spanish blades , of healths five fathom deep ; and then anon drums in his ear , at which he starts and wakes ; and , being thus frighted , swears a prayer or two , and sleeps again . this is that very mab that plats the manes of horses in the night ; and bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs , which , once untangled , much misfortune bodes : this is the hag , when maids lie on their backs , that presses them , and learns them first to bear , making them women of good carriage : this is she , —
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . peace , peace , mercutio , peace , thou talk ’ st of nothing . mercutio . true , i talk of dreams , which are the children of an idle brain , begot of nothing but vain fantasy , which is as thin of substance as the air , and more inconstant than the wind , who wooes even now the frozen bosom of the north , and , being anger ’ d , puffs away from thence , turning his side to the dew-dropping south .
shakespeare	romeo	benvolio . this wind you talk of blows us from ourselves : supper is done , and we shall come too late . romeo . i fear too early : for my mind misgives some consequence yet hanging in the stars , shall bitterly begin his fearful date with this night ’ s revels ; and expire the term of a despised life , clos ’ d in my breast by some vile forfeit of untimely death . but he that hath the steerage of my course direct my suit . on , lusty gentlemen !

shakespeare	romeo	romeo . what lady is that , which doth enrich the hand of yonder knight ? servant . i know not , sir . romeo . o , she doth teach the torches to burn bright ! it seems she hangs upon the cheek of night as a rich jewel in an ethiop ’ s ear ; beauty too rich for use , for earth too dear ! so shows a snowy dove trooping with crows as yonder lady o ’ er her fellows shows . the measure done , i ’ ll watch her place of stand , and touching hers , make blessed my rude hand . did my heart love till now ? forswear it , sight ! for i ne ’ er saw true beauty till this night .
shakespeare	romeo	tybalt . this by his voice , should be a montague . fetch me my rapier , boy . what , dares the slave come hither , cover ’ d with an antic face , to fleer and scorn at our solemnity ? now by the stock and honour of my kin , to strike him dead i hold it not a sin .
shakespeare	romeo	capulet . why how now , kinsman ! wherefore storm you so ? tybalt . uncle , this is a montague , our foe ; a villain that is hither come in spite , to scorn at our solemnity this night .
shakespeare	romeo	capulet . young romeo , is it ? tybalt . ’ tis he , that villain romeo . capulet . content thee , gentle coz , let him alone , a bears him like a portly gentleman ; and , to say truth , verona brags of him to be a virtuous and well-govern ’ d youth . i would not for the wealth of all the town here in my house do him disparagement . therefore be patient , take no note of him , it is my will ; the which if thou respect , show a fair presence and put off these frowns , an ill-beseeming semblance for a feast .
shakespeare	romeo	tybalt . it fits when such a villain is a guest : i ’ ll not endure him . capulet . he shall be endur ’ d . what , goodman boy ! i say he shall , go to ; am i the master here , or you ? go to . you ’ ll not endure him ! god shall mend my soul , you ’ ll make a mutiny among my guests ! you will set cock-a-hoop , you ’ ll be the man !

shakespeare	romeo	tybalt . patience perforce with wilful choler meeting makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting . i will withdraw : but this intrusion shall , now seeming sweet , convert to bitter gall . [ _exit._ ]
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . [ _to juliet._ ] if i profane with my unworthiest hand this holy shrine , the gentle sin is this , my lips , two blushing pilgrims , ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss .
shakespeare	romeo	juliet . good pilgrim , you do wrong your hand too much , which mannerly devotion shows in this ; for saints have hands that pilgrims ’ hands do touch , and palm to palm is holy palmers ’ kiss .
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . have not saints lips , and holy palmers too ? juliet . ay , pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer . romeo . o , then , dear saint , let lips do what hands do : they pray , grant thou , lest faith turn to despair .
shakespeare	romeo	juliet . saints do not move , though grant for prayers ’ sake . romeo . then move not while my prayer ’ s effect i take . thus from my lips , by thine my sin is purg ’ d . [ _kissing her._ ]

shakespeare	romeo	nurse . his name is romeo , and a montague , the only son of your great enemy . juliet . my only love sprung from my only hate ! too early seen unknown , and known too late ! prodigious birth of love it is to me , that i must love a loathed enemy .

shakespeare	romeo	[ _exeunt._ ] act ii enter chorus . chorus . now old desire doth in his deathbed lie , and young affection gapes to be his heir ; that fair for which love groan ’ d for and would die , with tender juliet match ’ d , is now not fair . now romeo is belov ’ d , and loves again , alike bewitched by the charm of looks ; but to his foe suppos ’ d he must complain , and she steal love ’ s sweet bait from fearful hooks : being held a foe , he may not have access to breathe such vows as lovers use to swear ; and she as much in love , her means much less to meet her new beloved anywhere . but passion lends them power , time means , to meet , tempering extremities with extreme sweet .

shakespeare	romeo	benvolio . he ran this way , and leap ’ d this orchard wall : call , good mercutio . mercutio . nay , i ’ ll conjure too . romeo ! humours ! madman ! passion ! lover ! appear thou in the likeness of a sigh , speak but one rhyme , and i am satisfied ; cry but ‘ ah me ! ’ pronounce but love and dove ; speak to my gossip venus one fair word , one nickname for her purblind son and heir , young abraham cupid , he that shot so trim when king cophetua lov ’ d the beggar-maid . he heareth not , he stirreth not , he moveth not ; the ape is dead , and i must conjure him . i conjure thee by rosaline ’ s bright eyes , by her high forehead and her scarlet lip , by her fine foot , straight leg , and quivering thigh , and the demesnes that there adjacent lie , that in thy likeness thou appear to us .
shakespeare	romeo	benvolio . an if he hear thee , thou wilt anger him . mercutio . this can not anger him . ’ twould anger him to raise a spirit in his mistress ’ circle , of some strange nature , letting it there stand till she had laid it , and conjur ’ d it down ; that were some spite . my invocation is fair and honest , and , in his mistress ’ name , i conjure only but to raise up him .
shakespeare	romeo	benvolio . come , he hath hid himself among these trees to be consorted with the humorous night . blind is his love , and best befits the dark . mercutio . if love be blind , love can not hit the mark . now will he sit under a medlar tree , and wish his mistress were that kind of fruit as maids call medlars when they laugh alone . o romeo , that she were , o that she were an open-arse and thou a poperin pear ! romeo , good night . i ’ ll to my truckle-bed . this field-bed is too cold for me to sleep . come , shall we go ?

shakespeare	romeo	juliet appears above at a window . but soft , what light through yonder window breaks ? it is the east , and juliet is the sun ! arise fair sun and kill the envious moon , who is already sick and pale with grief , that thou her maid art far more fair than she . be not her maid since she is envious ; her vestal livery is but sick and green , and none but fools do wear it ; cast it off . it is my lady , o it is my love ! o , that she knew she were ! she speaks , yet she says nothing . what of that ? her eye discourses , i will answer it . i am too bold , ’ tis not to me she speaks . two of the fairest stars in all the heaven , having some business , do entreat her eyes to twinkle in their spheres till they return . what if her eyes were there , they in her head ? the brightness of her cheek would shame those stars , as daylight doth a lamp ; her eyes in heaven would through the airy region stream so bright that birds would sing and think it were not night . see how she leans her cheek upon her hand . o that i were a glove upon that hand , that i might touch that cheek .
shakespeare	romeo	juliet . ay me . romeo . she speaks . o speak again bright angel , for thou art as glorious to this night , being o ’ er my head , as is a winged messenger of heaven unto the white-upturned wondering eyes of mortals that fall back to gaze on him when he bestrides the lazy-puffing clouds and sails upon the bosom of the air .
shakespeare	romeo	juliet . o romeo , romeo , wherefore art thou romeo ? deny thy father and refuse thy name . or if thou wilt not , be but sworn my love , and i ’ ll no longer be a capulet .
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . [ _aside._ ] shall i hear more , or shall i speak at this ? juliet . ’ tis but thy name that is my enemy ; thou art thyself , though not a montague . what ’ s montague ? it is nor hand nor foot , nor arm , nor face , nor any other part belonging to a man . o be some other name . what ’ s in a name ? that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet ; so romeo would , were he not romeo call ’ d , retain that dear perfection which he owes without that title . romeo , doff thy name , and for thy name , which is no part of thee , take all myself .
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . i take thee at thy word . call me but love , and i ’ ll be new baptis ’ d ; henceforth i never will be romeo . juliet . what man art thou that , thus bescreen ’ d in night so stumblest on my counsel ?
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . by a name i know not how to tell thee who i am : my name , dear saint , is hateful to myself , because it is an enemy to thee . had i it written , i would tear the word .
shakespeare	romeo	juliet . my ears have yet not drunk a hundred words of thy tongue ’ s utterance , yet i know the sound . art thou not romeo , and a montague ? romeo . neither , fair maid , if either thee dislike .
shakespeare	romeo	juliet . how cam ’ st thou hither , tell me , and wherefore ? the orchard walls are high and hard to climb , and the place death , considering who thou art , if any of my kinsmen find thee here .
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . with love ’ s light wings did i o ’ erperch these walls , for stony limits can not hold love out , and what love can do , that dares love attempt : therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me .
shakespeare	romeo	juliet . if they do see thee , they will murder thee . romeo . alack , there lies more peril in thine eye than twenty of their swords . look thou but sweet , and i am proof against their enmity .
shakespeare	romeo	juliet . i would not for the world they saw thee here . romeo . i have night ’ s cloak to hide me from their eyes , and but thou love me , let them find me here . my life were better ended by their hate than death prorogued , wanting of thy love .
shakespeare	romeo	juliet . by whose direction found ’ st thou out this place ? romeo . by love , that first did prompt me to enquire ; he lent me counsel , and i lent him eyes . i am no pilot ; yet wert thou as far as that vast shore wash ’ d with the farthest sea , i should adventure for such merchandise .
shakespeare	romeo	juliet . thou knowest the mask of night is on my face , else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek for that which thou hast heard me speak tonight . fain would i dwell on form , fain , fain deny what i have spoke ; but farewell compliment . dost thou love me ? i know thou wilt say ay , and i will take thy word . yet , if thou swear ’ st , thou mayst prove false . at lovers ’ perjuries , they say jove laughs . o gentle romeo , if thou dost love , pronounce it faithfully . or if thou thinkest i am too quickly won , i ’ ll frown and be perverse , and say thee nay , so thou wilt woo . but else , not for the world . in truth , fair montague , i am too fond ; and therefore thou mayst think my ’ haviour light : but trust me , gentleman , i ’ ll prove more true than those that have more cunning to be strange . i should have been more strange , i must confess , but that thou overheard ’ st , ere i was ’ ware , my true-love passion ; therefore pardon me , and not impute this yielding to light love , which the dark night hath so discovered .
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . lady , by yonder blessed moon i vow , that tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops , — juliet . o swear not by the moon , th ’ inconstant moon , that monthly changes in her circled orb , lest that thy love prove likewise variable .
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . what shall i swear by ? juliet . do not swear at all . or if thou wilt , swear by thy gracious self , which is the god of my idolatry , and i ’ ll believe thee .
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . if my heart ’ s dear love , — juliet . well , do not swear . although i joy in thee , i have no joy of this contract tonight ; it is too rash , too unadvis ’ d , too sudden , too like the lightning , which doth cease to be ere one can say it lightens . sweet , good night . this bud of love , by summer ’ s ripening breath , may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet . good night , good night . as sweet repose and rest come to thy heart as that within my breast .
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied ? juliet . what satisfaction canst thou have tonight ? romeo . th ’ exchange of thy love ’ s faithful vow for mine . juliet . i gave thee mine before thou didst request it ; and yet i would it were to give again .
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . would ’ st thou withdraw it ? for what purpose , love ? juliet . but to be frank and give it thee again . and yet i wish but for the thing i have ; my bounty is as boundless as the sea , my love as deep ; the more i give to thee , the more i have , for both are infinite . i hear some noise within . dear love , adieu . [ _nurse calls within._ ] anon , good nurse ! —sweet montague be true . stay but a little , i will come again .
shakespeare	romeo	[ _exit._ ] romeo . o blessed , blessed night . i am afeard , being in night , all this is but a dream , too flattering sweet to be substantial . enter juliet above . juliet . three words , dear romeo , and good night indeed . if that thy bent of love be honourable , thy purpose marriage , send me word tomorrow , by one that i ’ ll procure to come to thee , where and what time thou wilt perform the rite , and all my fortunes at thy foot i ’ ll lay and follow thee my lord throughout the world .
shakespeare	romeo	nurse . [ _within._ ] madam . juliet . i come , anon.— but if thou meanest not well , i do beseech thee , — nurse . [ _within._ ] madam . juliet . by and by i come— to cease thy strife and leave me to my grief . tomorrow will i send .
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . so thrive my soul , — juliet . a thousand times good night . [ _exit._ ] romeo . a thousand times the worse , to want thy light . love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books , but love from love , towards school with heavy looks .
shakespeare	romeo	[ _retiring slowly._ ] re-enter juliet , above . juliet . hist ! romeo , hist ! o for a falconer ’ s voice to lure this tassel-gentle back again . bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud , else would i tear the cave where echo lies , and make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine with repetition of my romeo ’ s name .
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . it is my soul that calls upon my name . how silver-sweet sound lovers ’ tongues by night , like softest music to attending ears . juliet . romeo . romeo . my nyas ? juliet . what o ’ clock tomorrow shall i send to thee ?
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . by the hour of nine . juliet . i will not fail . ’ tis twenty years till then . i have forgot why i did call thee back . romeo . let me stand here till thou remember it .
shakespeare	romeo	juliet . i shall forget , to have thee still stand there , remembering how i love thy company . romeo . and i ’ ll still stay , to have thee still forget , forgetting any other home but this .
shakespeare	romeo	juliet . ’ tis almost morning ; i would have thee gone , and yet no farther than a wanton ’ s bird , that lets it hop a little from her hand , like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves , and with a silk thread plucks it back again , so loving-jealous of his liberty .
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . i would i were thy bird . juliet . sweet , so would i : yet i should kill thee with much cherishing . good night , good night . parting is such sweet sorrow that i shall say good night till it be morrow .
shakespeare	romeo	[ _exit._ ] romeo . sleep dwell upon thine eyes , peace in thy breast . would i were sleep and peace , so sweet to rest . the grey-ey ’ d morn smiles on the frowning night , chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light ; and darkness fleckled like a drunkard reels from forth day ’ s pathway , made by titan ’ s wheels hence will i to my ghostly sire ’ s cell , his help to crave and my dear hap to tell .
shakespeare	romeo	[ _exit._ ] scene iii . friar lawrence ’ s cell . enter friar lawrence with a basket . friar lawrence . now , ere the sun advance his burning eye , the day to cheer , and night ’ s dank dew to dry , i must upfill this osier cage of ours with baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers . the earth that ’ s nature ’ s mother , is her tomb ; what is her burying grave , that is her womb : and from her womb children of divers kind we sucking on her natural bosom find . many for many virtues excellent , none but for some , and yet all different . o , mickle is the powerful grace that lies in plants , herbs , stones , and their true qualities . for naught so vile that on the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give ; nor aught so good but , strain ’ d from that fair use , revolts from true birth , stumbling on abuse . virtue itself turns vice being misapplied , and vice sometime ’ s by action dignified .
shakespeare	romeo	enter romeo . within the infant rind of this weak flower poison hath residence , and medicine power : for this , being smelt , with that part cheers each part ; being tasted , slays all senses with the heart . two such opposed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs , —grace and rude will ; and where the worser is predominant , full soon the canker death eats up that plant .
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . good morrow , father . friar lawrence . benedicite ! what early tongue so sweet saluteth me ? young son , it argues a distemper ’ d head so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed . care keeps his watch in every old man ’ s eye , and where care lodges sleep will never lie ; but where unbruised youth with unstuff ’ d brain doth couch his limbs , there golden sleep doth reign . therefore thy earliness doth me assure thou art uprous ’ d with some distemperature ; or if not so , then here i hit it right , our romeo hath not been in bed tonight .
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . that last is true ; the sweeter rest was mine . friar lawrence . god pardon sin . wast thou with rosaline ? romeo . with rosaline , my ghostly father ? no . i have forgot that name , and that name ’ s woe .
shakespeare	romeo	friar lawrence . that ’ s my good son . but where hast thou been then ? romeo . i ’ ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again . i have been feasting with mine enemy , where on a sudden one hath wounded me that ’ s by me wounded . both our remedies within thy help and holy physic lies . i bear no hatred , blessed man ; for lo , my intercession likewise steads my foe .
shakespeare	romeo	friar lawrence . be plain , good son , and homely in thy drift ; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift . romeo . then plainly know my heart ’ s dear love is set on the fair daughter of rich capulet . as mine on hers , so hers is set on mine ; and all combin ’ d , save what thou must combine by holy marriage . when , and where , and how we met , we woo ’ d , and made exchange of vow , i ’ ll tell thee as we pass ; but this i pray , that thou consent to marry us today .
shakespeare	romeo	friar lawrence . holy saint francis ! what a change is here ! is rosaline , that thou didst love so dear , so soon forsaken ? young men ’ s love then lies not truly in their hearts , but in their eyes . jesu maria , what a deal of brine hath wash ’ d thy sallow cheeks for rosaline ! how much salt water thrown away in waste , to season love , that of it doth not taste . the sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears , thy old groans yet ring in mine ancient ears . lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit of an old tear that is not wash ’ d off yet . if ere thou wast thyself , and these woes thine , thou and these woes were all for rosaline , and art thou chang ’ d ? pronounce this sentence then , women may fall , when there ’ s no strength in men .
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . thou chidd ’ st me oft for loving rosaline . friar lawrence . for doting , not for loving , pupil mine . romeo . and bad ’ st me bury love . friar lawrence . not in a grave to lay one in , another out to have .

shakespeare	romeo	benvolio . not to his father ’ s ; i spoke with his man . mercutio . why , that same pale hard-hearted wench , that rosaline , torments him so that he will sure run mad . benvolio . tybalt , the kinsman to old capulet , hath sent a letter to his father ’ s house .
shakespeare	romeo	mercutio . a challenge , on my life . benvolio . romeo will answer it . mercutio . any man that can write may answer a letter . benvolio . nay , he will answer the letter ’ s master , how he dares , being dared .
shakespeare	romeo	mercutio . alas poor romeo , he is already dead , stabbed with a white wench ’ s black eye ; run through the ear with a love song , the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy ’ s butt-shaft . and is he a man to encounter tybalt ?
shakespeare	romeo	benvolio . why , what is tybalt ? mercutio . more than prince of cats . o , he ’ s the courageous captain of compliments . he fights as you sing prick-song , keeps time , distance , and proportion . he rests his minim rest , one , two , and the third in your bosom : the very butcher of a silk button , a duellist , a duellist ; a gentleman of the very first house , of the first and second cause . ah , the immortal passado , the punto reverso , the hay .
shakespeare	romeo	benvolio . the what ? mercutio . the pox of such antic lisping , affecting phantasies ; these new tuners of accent . by jesu , a very good blade , a very tall man , a very good whore . why , is not this a lamentable thing , grandsire , that we should be thus afflicted with these strange flies , these fashion-mongers , these pardon-me ’ s , who stand so much on the new form that they can not sit at ease on the old bench ? o their bones , their bones !
shakespeare	romeo	enter romeo . benvolio . here comes romeo , here comes romeo ! mercutio . without his roe , like a dried herring . o flesh , flesh , how art thou fishified ! now is he for the numbers that petrarch flowed in . laura , to his lady , was but a kitchen wench , —marry , she had a better love to berhyme her : dido a dowdy ; cleopatra a gypsy ; helen and hero hildings and harlots ; thisbe a grey eye or so , but not to the purpose . signior romeo , bonjour ! there ’ s a french salutation to your french slop . you gave us the counterfeit fairly last night .
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . good morrow to you both . what counterfeit did i give you ? mercutio . the slip sir , the slip ; can you not conceive ? romeo . pardon , good mercutio , my business was great , and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy .
shakespeare	romeo	mercutio . that ’ s as much as to say , such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams . romeo . meaning , to curtsy . mercutio . thou hast most kindly hit it .
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . a most courteous exposition . mercutio . nay , i am the very pink of courtesy . romeo . pink for flower . mercutio . right . romeo . why , then is my pump well flowered . mercutio . sure wit , follow me this jest now , till thou hast worn out thy pump , that when the single sole of it is worn , the jest may remain after the wearing , solely singular .
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . o single-soled jest , solely singular for the singleness ! mercutio . come between us , good benvolio ; my wits faint . romeo . swits and spurs , swits and spurs ; or i ’ ll cry a match .
shakespeare	romeo	mercutio . nay , if thy wits run the wild-goose chase , i am done . for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits , than i am sure , i have in my whole five . was i with you there for the goose ?
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . thou wast never with me for anything , when thou wast not there for the goose . mercutio . i will bite thee by the ear for that jest . romeo . nay , good goose , bite not .
shakespeare	romeo	mercutio . thy wit is a very bitter sweeting , it is a most sharp sauce . romeo . and is it not then well served in to a sweet goose ? mercutio . o here ’ s a wit of cheveril , that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad .
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . i stretch it out for that word broad , which added to the goose , proves thee far and wide a broad goose . mercutio . why , is not this better now than groaning for love ? now art thou sociable , now art thou romeo ; not art thou what thou art , by art as well as by nature . for this drivelling love is like a great natural , that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole .
shakespeare	romeo	benvolio . stop there , stop there . mercutio . thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair . benvolio . thou wouldst else have made thy tale large . mercutio . o , thou art deceived ; i would have made it short , for i was come to the whole depth of my tale , and meant indeed to occupy the argument no longer .

shakespeare	romeo	romeo . i can tell you : but young romeo will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him . i am the youngest of that name , for fault of a worse .
shakespeare	romeo	nurse . you say well . mercutio . yea , is the worst well ? very well took , i ’ faith ; wisely , wisely . nurse . if you be he , sir , i desire some confidence with you . benvolio . she will endite him to some supper .
shakespeare	romeo	mercutio . a bawd , a bawd , a bawd ! so ho ! romeo . what hast thou found ? mercutio . no hare , sir ; unless a hare , sir , in a lenten pie , that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent . [ _sings._ ] an old hare hoar , and an old hare hoar , is very good meat in lent ; but a hare that is hoar is too much for a score when it hoars ere it be spent . romeo , will you come to your father ’ s ? we ’ ll to dinner thither .
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . i will follow you . mercutio . farewell , ancient lady ; farewell , lady , lady , lady . [ _exeunt mercutio and benvolio._ ] nurse . i pray you , sir , what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his ropery ?
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . a gentleman , nurse , that loves to hear himself talk , and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month . nurse . and a speak anything against me , i ’ ll take him down , and a were lustier than he is , and twenty such jacks . and if i can not , i ’ ll find those that shall . scurvy knave ! i am none of his flirt-gills ; i am none of his skains-mates.—and thou must stand by too and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure !

shakespeare	romeo	nurse . now , afore god , i am so vexed that every part about me quivers . scurvy knave . pray you , sir , a word : and as i told you , my young lady bid me enquire you out ; what she bade me say , i will keep to myself . but first let me tell ye , if ye should lead her in a fool ’ s paradise , as they say , it were a very gross kind of behaviour , as they say ; for the gentlewoman is young . and therefore , if you should deal double with her , truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman , and very weak dealing .
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . nurse , commend me to thy lady and mistress . i protest unto thee , — nurse . good heart , and i ’ faith i will tell her as much . lord , lord , she will be a joyful woman .
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . what wilt thou tell her , nurse ? thou dost not mark me . nurse . i will tell her , sir , that you do protest , which , as i take it , is a gentlemanlike offer .
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . bid her devise some means to come to shrift this afternoon , and there she shall at friar lawrence ’ cell be shriv ’ d and married . here is for thy pains . nurse . no truly , sir ; not a penny .
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . go to ; i say you shall . nurse . this afternoon , sir ? well , she shall be there . romeo . and stay , good nurse , behind the abbey wall . within this hour my man shall be with thee , and bring thee cords made like a tackled stair , which to the high topgallant of my joy must be my convoy in the secret night . farewell , be trusty , and i ’ ll quit thy pains ; farewell ; commend me to thy mistress .
shakespeare	romeo	nurse . now god in heaven bless thee . hark you , sir . romeo . what say ’ st thou , my dear nurse ? nurse . is your man secret ? did you ne ’ er hear say , two may keep counsel , putting one away ?
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . i warrant thee my man ’ s as true as steel . nurse . well , sir , my mistress is the sweetest lady . lord , lord ! when ’ twas a little prating thing , —o , there is a nobleman in town , one paris , that would fain lay knife aboard ; but she , good soul , had as lief see a toad , a very toad , as see him . i anger her sometimes , and tell her that paris is the properer man , but i ’ ll warrant you , when i say so , she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world . doth not rosemary and romeo begin both with a letter ?
shakespeare	romeo	romeo . ay , nurse ; what of that ? both with an r. nurse . ah , mocker ! that ’ s the dog ’ s name . r is for the—no , i know it begins with some other letter , and she hath the prettiest sententious of it , of you and rosemary , that it would do you good to hear it .

shakespeare	romeo	enter nurse and peter . o god , she comes . o honey nurse , what news ? hast thou met with him ? send thy man away . nurse . peter , stay at the gate . [ _exit peter._ ]
shakespeare	romeo	juliet . now , good sweet nurse , —o lord , why look ’ st thou sad ? though news be sad , yet tell them merrily ; if good , thou sham ’ st the music of sweet news by playing it to me with so sour a face .
shakespeare	romeo	nurse . i am aweary , give me leave awhile ; fie , how my bones ache ! what a jaunt have i had ! juliet . i would thou hadst my bones , and i thy news : nay come , i pray thee speak ; good , good nurse , speak .
shakespeare	romeo	nurse . jesu , what haste ? can you not stay a while ? do you not see that i am out of breath ? juliet . how art thou out of breath , when thou hast breath to say to me that thou art out of breath ? the excuse that thou dost make in this delay is longer than the tale thou dost excuse . is thy news good or bad ? answer to that ; say either , and i ’ ll stay the circumstance . let me be satisfied , is ’ t good or bad ?
shakespeare	romeo	nurse . well , you have made a simple choice ; you know not how to choose a man . romeo ? no , not he . though his face be better than any man ’ s , yet his leg excels all men ’ s , and for a hand and a foot , and a body , though they be not to be talked on , yet they are past compare . he is not the flower of courtesy , but i ’ ll warrant him as gentle as a lamb . go thy ways , wench , serve god . what , have you dined at home ?
shakespeare	romeo	juliet . no , no . but all this did i know before . what says he of our marriage ? what of that ? nurse . lord , how my head aches ! what a head have i ! it beats as it would fall in twenty pieces . my back o ’ t ’ other side , —o my back , my back ! beshrew your heart for sending me about to catch my death with jauncing up and down .
shakespeare	romeo	juliet . i ’ faith , i am sorry that thou art not well . sweet , sweet , sweet nurse , tell me , what says my love ? nurse . your love says like an honest gentleman , and a courteous , and a kind , and a handsome , and i warrant a virtuous , —where is your mother ?
shakespeare	romeo	juliet . where is my mother ? why , she is within . where should she be ? how oddly thou repliest . ‘ your love says , like an honest gentleman , ‘ where is your mother ? ’ nurse . o god ’ s lady dear , are you so hot ? marry , come up , i trow . is this the poultice for my aching bones ? henceforward do your messages yourself .
shakespeare	romeo	juliet . here ’ s such a coil . come , what says romeo ? nurse . have you got leave to go to shrift today ? juliet . i have . nurse . then hie you hence to friar lawrence ’ cell ; there stays a husband to make you a wife . now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks , they ’ ll be in scarlet straight at any news . hie you to church . i must another way , to fetch a ladder by the which your love must climb a bird ’ s nest soon when it is dark . i am the drudge , and toil in your delight ; but you shall bear the burden soon at night . go . i ’ ll to dinner ; hie you to the cell .

shakespeare	romeo	romeo . amen , amen , but come what sorrow can , it can not countervail the exchange of joy that one short minute gives me in her sight . do thou but close our hands with holy words , then love-devouring death do what he dare , it is enough i may but call her mine .
shakespeare	romeo	friar lawrence . these violent delights have violent ends , and in their triumph die ; like fire and powder , which as they kiss consume . the sweetest honey is loathsome in his own deliciousness , and in the taste confounds the appetite . therefore love moderately : long love doth so ; too swift arrives as tardy as too slow .
shakespeare	romeo	enter juliet . here comes the lady . o , so light a foot will ne ’ er wear out the everlasting flint . a lover may bestride the gossamers that idles in the wanton summer air and yet not fall ; so light is vanity .

shakespeare	romeo	juliet . conceit more rich in matter than in words , brags of his substance , not of ornament . they are but beggars that can count their worth ; but my true love is grown to such excess , i can not sum up sum of half my wealth .

shakespeare	romeo	mercutio . thou art like one of these fellows that , when he enters the confines of a tavern , claps me his sword upon the table , and says ‘ god send me no need of thee ! ’ and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer , when indeed there is no need .
shakespeare	romeo	benvolio . am i like such a fellow ? mercutio . come , come , thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in italy ; and as soon moved to be moody , and as soon moody to be moved .
shakespeare	romeo	benvolio . and what to ? mercutio . nay , an there were two such , we should have none shortly , for one would kill the other . thou ? why , thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast . thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts , having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes . what eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel ? thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat , and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling . thou hast quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street , because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun . didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before easter ? with another for tying his new shoes with an old riband ? and yet thou wilt tutor me from quarrelling !

shakespeare	othello	iago . despise me if i do not . three great ones of the city , in personal suit to make me his lieutenant , off-capp ’ d to him ; and by the faith of man , i know my price , i am worth no worse a place . but he , as loving his own pride and purposes , evades them , with a bombast circumstance , horribly stuff ’ d with epithets of war : and in conclusion , nonsuits my mediators : for “ certes , ” says he , “ i have already chose my officer. ” and what was he ? forsooth , a great arithmetician , one michael cassio , a florentine , a fellow almost damn ’ d in a fair wife , that never set a squadron in the field , nor the division of a battle knows more than a spinster , unless the bookish theoric , wherein the toged consuls can propose as masterly as he : mere prattle without practice is all his soldiership . but he , sir , had the election , and i , of whom his eyes had seen the proof at rhodes , at cyprus , and on other grounds , christian and heathen , must be belee ’ d and calm ’ d by debitor and creditor , this counter-caster , he , in good time , must his lieutenant be , and i , god bless the mark , his moorship ’ s ancient .

shakespeare	othello	roderigo . i would not follow him , then . iago . o , sir , content you . i follow him to serve my turn upon him : we can not all be masters , nor all masters can not be truly follow ’ d . you shall mark many a duteous and knee-crooking knave that , doting on his own obsequious bondage , wears out his time , much like his master ’ s ass , for nought but provender , and when he ’ s old , cashier ’ d . whip me such honest knaves . others there are who , trimm ’ d in forms , and visages of duty , keep yet their hearts attending on themselves , and throwing but shows of service on their lords , do well thrive by them , and when they have lin ’ d their coats , do themselves homage . these fellows have some soul , and such a one do i profess myself . for , sir , it is as sure as you are roderigo , were i the moor , i would not be iago : in following him , i follow but myself . heaven is my judge , not i for love and duty , but seeming so for my peculiar end . for when my outward action doth demonstrate the native act and figure of my heart in complement extern , ’ tis not long after but i will wear my heart upon my sleeve for daws to peck at : i am not what i am .
shakespeare	othello	roderigo . what a full fortune does the thick-lips owe , if he can carry ’ t thus ! iago . call up her father , rouse him , make after him , poison his delight , proclaim him in the streets ; incense her kinsmen , and though he in a fertile climate dwell , plague him with flies : though that his joy be joy , yet throw such changes of vexation on ’ t , as it may lose some color .
shakespeare	othello	roderigo . here is her father ’ s house , i ’ ll call aloud . iago . do , with like timorous accent and dire yell as when , by night and negligence , the fire is spied in populous cities .

shakespeare	othello	brabantio . what profane wretch art thou ? iago . i am one , sir , that comes to tell you your daughter and the moor are now making the beast with two backs . brabantio . thou art a villain .
shakespeare	othello	iago . you are a senator . brabantio . this thou shalt answer . i know thee , roderigo . roderigo . sir , i will answer anything . but i beseech you , if ’ t be your pleasure , and most wise consent , ( as partly i find it is ) that your fair daughter , at this odd-even and dull watch o ’ the night , transported with no worse nor better guard , but with a knave of common hire , a gondolier , to the gross clasps of a lascivious moor : if this be known to you , and your allowance , we then have done you bold and saucy wrongs . but if you know not this , my manners tell me , we have your wrong rebuke . do not believe that from the sense of all civility , i thus would play and trifle with your reverence . your daughter ( if you have not given her leave ) i say again , hath made a gross revolt , tying her duty , beauty , wit , and fortunes in an extravagant and wheeling stranger of here and everywhere . straight satisfy yourself : if she be in her chamber or your house , let loose on me the justice of the state for thus deluding you .
shakespeare	othello	brabantio . strike on the tinder , ho ! give me a taper ! call up all my people ! this accident is not unlike my dream , belief of it oppresses me already . light , i say , light !
shakespeare	othello	[ _exit from above._ ] iago . farewell ; for i must leave you : it seems not meet nor wholesome to my place to be produc ’ d , as if i stay i shall , against the moor . for i do know the state , however this may gall him with some check , can not with safety cast him , for he ’ s embark ’ d with such loud reason to the cyprus wars , which even now stand in act , that , for their souls , another of his fathom they have none to lead their business . in which regard , though i do hate him as i do hell pains , yet , for necessity of present life , i must show out a flag and sign of love , which is indeed but sign . that you shall surely find him , lead to the sagittary the raised search , and there will i be with him . so , farewell .

( o , she deceives me past thought . ) what said she to you ? get more tapers , raise all my kindred . are they married , think you ?
shakespeare	othello	roderigo . truly i think they are . brabantio . o heaven ! how got she out ? o treason of the blood ! fathers , from hence trust not your daughters ’ minds by what you see them act . is there not charms by which the property of youth and maidhood may be abused ? have you not read , roderigo , of some such thing ?
shakespeare	othello	roderigo . yes , sir , i have indeed . brabantio . call up my brother . o , would you had had her ! some one way , some another . do you know where we may apprehend her and the moor ?
shakespeare	othello	roderigo . i think i can discover him , if you please to get good guard , and go along with me . brabantio . pray you lead on . at every house i ’ ll call , i may command at most . get weapons , ho ! and raise some special officers of night . on , good roderigo . i will deserve your pains .

shakespeare	othello	othello . let him do his spite ; my services , which i have done the signiory , shall out-tongue his complaints . ’ tis yet to know , — which , when i know that boasting is an honour , i shall promulgate , —i fetch my life and being from men of royal siege . and my demerits may speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune as this that i have reach ’ d . for know , iago , but that i love the gentle desdemona , i would not my unhoused free condition put into circumscription and confine for the sea ’ s worth . but look , what lights come yond ?
shakespeare	othello	iago . those are the raised father and his friends : you were best go in . othello . not i ; i must be found . my parts , my title , and my perfect soul shall manifest me rightly . is it they ?
shakespeare	othello	iago . by janus , i think no . enter cassio and officers with torches . othello . the servants of the duke and my lieutenant . the goodness of the night upon you , friends ! what is the news ?
shakespeare	othello	cassio . the duke does greet you , general , and he requires your haste-post-haste appearance even on the instant . othello . what is the matter , think you ? cassio . something from cyprus , as i may divine . it is a business of some heat . the galleys have sent a dozen sequent messengers this very night at one another ’ s heels ; and many of the consuls , rais ’ d and met , are at the duke ’ s already . you have been hotly call ’ d for , when , being not at your lodging to be found , the senate hath sent about three several quests to search you out .
shakespeare	othello	othello . ’ tis well i am found by you . i will but spend a word here in the house , and go with you . [ _exit._ ] cassio . ancient , what makes he here ? iago . faith , he tonight hath boarded a land carrack : if it prove lawful prize , he ’ s made forever .
shakespeare	othello	cassio . i do not understand . iago . he ’ s married . cassio . to who ? enter othello . iago . marry to—come , captain , will you go ? othello . have with you . cassio . here comes another troop to seek for you .
shakespeare	othello	enter brabantio , roderigo and officers with torches and weapons . iago . it is brabantio . general , be advis ’ d , he comes to bad intent . othello . holla , stand there ! roderigo . signior , it is the moor .
shakespeare	othello	brabantio . down with him , thief ! [ _they draw on both sides._ ] iago . you , roderigo ! come , sir , i am for you . othello . keep up your bright swords , for the dew will rust them . good signior , you shall more command with years than with your weapons .
shakespeare	othello	brabantio . o thou foul thief , where hast thou stow ’ d my daughter ? damn ’ d as thou art , thou hast enchanted her , for i ’ ll refer me to all things of sense , ( if she in chains of magic were not bound ) whether a maid so tender , fair , and happy , so opposite to marriage , that she shunn ’ d the wealthy curled darlings of our nation , would ever have , to incur a general mock , run from her guardage to the sooty bosom of such a thing as thou—to fear , not to delight . judge me the world , if ’ tis not gross in sense , that thou hast practis ’ d on her with foul charms , abus ’ d her delicate youth with drugs or minerals that weakens motion . i ’ ll have ’ t disputed on ; ’ tis probable , and palpable to thinking . i therefore apprehend and do attach thee for an abuser of the world , a practiser of arts inhibited and out of warrant.— lay hold upon him , if he do resist , subdue him at his peril .
shakespeare	othello	othello . hold your hands , both you of my inclining and the rest : were it my cue to fight , i should have known it without a prompter . where will you that i go to answer this your charge ?
shakespeare	othello	brabantio . to prison , till fit time of law and course of direct session call thee to answer . othello . what if i do obey ? how may the duke be therewith satisfied , whose messengers are here about my side , upon some present business of the state , to bring me to him ?
shakespeare	othello	officer . ’ tis true , most worthy signior , the duke ’ s in council , and your noble self , i am sure is sent for . brabantio . how ? the duke in council ? in this time of the night ? bring him away ; mine ’ s not an idle cause . the duke himself , or any of my brothers of the state , can not but feel this wrong as ’ twere their own . for if such actions may have passage free , bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be .
shakespeare	othello	[ _exeunt._ ] scene iii . venice . a council chamber . the duke and senators sitting at a table ; officers attending . duke . there is no composition in these news that gives them credit . first senator . indeed , they are disproportion ’ d ; my letters say a hundred and seven galleys .
shakespeare	othello	duke . and mine a hundred and forty . second senator and mine two hundred : but though they jump not on a just account , ( as in these cases , where the aim reports , ’ tis oft with difference , ) yet do they all confirm a turkish fleet , and bearing up to cyprus .
shakespeare	othello	duke . nay , it is possible enough to judgement : i do not so secure me in the error , but the main article i do approve in fearful sense . sailor . [ _within._ ] what , ho ! what , ho ! what , ho !
shakespeare	othello	officer . a messenger from the galleys . enter sailor . duke . now , —what ’ s the business ? sailor . the turkish preparation makes for rhodes , so was i bid report here to the state by signior angelo .
shakespeare	othello	duke . how say you by this change ? first senator . this can not be by no assay of reason . ’ tis a pageant to keep us in false gaze . when we consider the importancy of cyprus to the turk ; and let ourselves again but understand that , as it more concerns the turk than rhodes , so may he with more facile question bear it , for that it stands not in such warlike brace , but altogether lacks the abilities that rhodes is dress ’ d in . if we make thought of this , we must not think the turk is so unskilful to leave that latest which concerns him first , neglecting an attempt of ease and gain , to wake and wage a danger profitless .
shakespeare	othello	duke . nay , in all confidence , he ’ s not for rhodes . officer . here is more news . enter a messenger . messenger . the ottomites , reverend and gracious , steering with due course toward the isle of rhodes , have there injointed them with an after fleet .
shakespeare	othello	first senator . ay , so i thought . how many , as you guess ? messenger . of thirty sail , and now they do re-stem their backward course , bearing with frank appearance their purposes toward cyprus . signior montano , your trusty and most valiant servitor , with his free duty recommends you thus , and prays you to believe him .
shakespeare	othello	duke . ’ tis certain , then , for cyprus . marcus luccicos , is not he in town ? first senator . he ’ s now in florence . duke . write from us to him ; post-post-haste dispatch . first senator . here comes brabantio and the valiant moor .
shakespeare	othello	enter brabantio , othello , iago , roderigo and officers . duke . valiant othello , we must straight employ you against the general enemy ottoman . [ _to brabantio._ ] i did not see you ; welcome , gentle signior , we lack ’ d your counsel and your help tonight .
shakespeare	othello	brabantio . so did i yours . good your grace , pardon me . neither my place , nor aught i heard of business hath rais ’ d me from my bed , nor doth the general care take hold on me ; for my particular grief is of so flood-gate and o ’ erbearing nature that it engluts and swallows other sorrows , and it is still itself .
shakespeare	othello	duke . why , what ’ s the matter ? brabantio . my daughter ! o , my daughter ! duke and senators . dead ? brabantio . ay , to me . she is abused , stol ’ n from me , and corrupted by spells and medicines bought of mountebanks ; for nature so preposterously to err , being not deficient , blind , or lame of sense , sans witchcraft could not .
shakespeare	othello	duke . whoe ’ er he be , that in this foul proceeding , hath thus beguil ’ d your daughter of herself , and you of her , the bloody book of law you shall yourself read in the bitter letter , after your own sense , yea , though our proper son stood in your action .
shakespeare	othello	brabantio . humbly i thank your grace . here is the man , this moor , whom now it seems your special mandate for the state affairs hath hither brought . all . we are very sorry for ’ t .
shakespeare	othello	duke . [ _to othello._ ] what , in your own part , can you say to this ? brabantio . nothing , but this is so . othello . most potent , grave , and reverend signiors , my very noble and approv ’ d good masters : that i have ta ’ en away this old man ’ s daughter , it is most true ; true , i have married her . the very head and front of my offending hath this extent , no more . rude am i in my speech , and little bless ’ d with the soft phrase of peace ; for since these arms of mine had seven years ’ pith , till now some nine moons wasted , they have us ’ d their dearest action in the tented field , and little of this great world can i speak , more than pertains to feats of broil and battle , and therefore little shall i grace my cause in speaking for myself . yet , by your gracious patience , i will a round unvarnish ’ d tale deliver of my whole course of love : what drugs , what charms , what conjuration , and what mighty magic , ( for such proceeding i am charged withal ) i won his daughter .
shakespeare	othello	brabantio . a maiden never bold : of spirit so still and quiet that her motion blush ’ d at herself ; and she , in spite of nature , of years , of country , credit , everything , to fall in love with what she fear ’ d to look on ! it is judgement maim ’ d and most imperfect that will confess perfection so could err against all rules of nature , and must be driven to find out practices of cunning hell , why this should be . i therefore vouch again , that with some mixtures powerful o ’ er the blood , or with some dram conjur ’ d to this effect , he wrought upon her .
shakespeare	othello	duke . to vouch this is no proof ; without more wider and more overt test than these thin habits and poor likelihoods of modern seeming do prefer against him . first senator . but , othello , speak : did you by indirect and forced courses subdue and poison this young maid ’ s affections ? or came it by request , and such fair question as soul to soul affordeth ?
shakespeare	othello	othello . i do beseech you , send for the lady to the sagittary , and let her speak of me before her father . if you do find me foul in her report , the trust , the office i do hold of you , not only take away , but let your sentence even fall upon my life .
shakespeare	othello	duke . fetch desdemona hither . othello . ancient , conduct them , you best know the place . [ _exeunt iago and attendants._ ] and till she come , as truly as to heaven i do confess the vices of my blood , so justly to your grave ears i ’ ll present how i did thrive in this fair lady ’ s love , and she in mine .
shakespeare	othello	duke . say it , othello . othello . her father lov ’ d me , oft invited me , still question ’ d me the story of my life , from year to year—the battles , sieges , fortunes , that i have pass ’ d . i ran it through , even from my boyish days to the very moment that he bade me tell it , wherein i spake of most disastrous chances , of moving accidents by flood and field ; of hair-breadth scapes i ’ th ’ imminent deadly breach ; of being taken by the insolent foe , and sold to slavery , of my redemption thence , and portance in my traveler ’ s history , wherein of antres vast and deserts idle , rough quarries , rocks , and hills whose heads touch heaven , it was my hint to speak , —such was the process ; and of the cannibals that each other eat , the anthropophagi , and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders . this to hear would desdemona seriously incline . but still the house affairs would draw her thence , which ever as she could with haste dispatch , she ’ d come again , and with a greedy ear devour up my discourse ; which i observing , took once a pliant hour , and found good means to draw from her a prayer of earnest heart that i would all my pilgrimage dilate , whereof by parcels she had something heard , but not intentively . i did consent , and often did beguile her of her tears , when i did speak of some distressful stroke that my youth suffer ’ d . my story being done , she gave me for my pains a world of sighs . she swore , in faith , ’ twas strange , ’ twas passing strange ; ’ twas pitiful , ’ twas wondrous pitiful . she wish ’ d she had not heard it , yet she wish ’ d that heaven had made her such a man : she thank ’ d me , and bade me , if i had a friend that lov ’ d her , i should but teach him how to tell my story , and that would woo her . upon this hint i spake : she lov ’ d me for the dangers i had pass ’ d , and i lov ’ d her that she did pity them . this only is the witchcraft i have us ’ d . here comes the lady . let her witness it .
shakespeare	othello	enter desdemona , iago and attendants . duke . i think this tale would win my daughter too . good brabantio , take up this mangled matter at the best . men do their broken weapons rather use than their bare hands .
shakespeare	othello	brabantio . i pray you hear her speak . if she confess that she was half the wooer , destruction on my head , if my bad blame light on the man ! —come hither , gentle mistress : do you perceive in all this noble company where most you owe obedience ?
shakespeare	othello	desdemona . my noble father , i do perceive here a divided duty : to you i am bound for life and education . my life and education both do learn me how to respect you . you are the lord of duty , i am hitherto your daughter : but here ’ s my husband . and so much duty as my mother show ’ d to you , preferring you before her father , so much i challenge that i may profess due to the moor my lord .
shakespeare	othello	brabantio . god be with you ! i have done . please it your grace , on to the state affairs . i had rather to adopt a child than get it.— come hither , moor : i here do give thee that with all my heart which , but thou hast already , with all my heart i would keep from thee.—for your sake , jewel , i am glad at soul i have no other child , for thy escape would teach me tyranny , to hang clogs on them.—i have done , my lord .
shakespeare	othello	duke . let me speak like yourself , and lay a sentence , which as a grise or step may help these lovers into your favour . when remedies are past , the griefs are ended by seeing the worst , which late on hopes depended . to mourn a mischief that is past and gone is the next way to draw new mischief on . what can not be preserved when fortune takes , patience her injury a mockery makes . the robb ’ d that smiles steals something from the thief ; he robs himself that spends a bootless grief .
shakespeare	othello	brabantio . so let the turk of cyprus us beguile , we lose it not so long as we can smile ; he bears the sentence well , that nothing bears but the free comfort which from thence he hears ; but he bears both the sentence and the sorrow that , to pay grief , must of poor patience borrow . these sentences to sugar or to gall , being strong on both sides , are equivocal : but words are words ; i never yet did hear that the bruis ’ d heart was pierced through the ear . i humbly beseech you , proceed to the affairs of state .
shakespeare	othello	duke . the turk with a most mighty preparation makes for cyprus . othello , the fortitude of the place is best known to you . and though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency , yet opinion , a sovereign mistress of effects , throws a more safer voice on you : you must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous expedition .
shakespeare	othello	othello . the tyrant custom , most grave senators , hath made the flinty and steel couch of war my thrice-driven bed of down : i do agnize a natural and prompt alacrity i find in hardness , and do undertake this present wars against the ottomites . most humbly , therefore , bending to your state , i crave fit disposition for my wife , due reference of place and exhibition , with such accommodation and besort as levels with her breeding .
shakespeare	othello	duke . if you please , be ’ t at her father ’ s . brabantio . i ’ ll not have it so . othello . nor i. desdemona . nor i. i would not there reside , to put my father in impatient thoughts , by being in his eye . most gracious duke , to my unfolding lend your prosperous ear , and let me find a charter in your voice t ’ assist my simpleness .
shakespeare	othello	duke . what would you , desdemona ? desdemona . that i did love the moor to live with him , my downright violence and storm of fortunes may trumpet to the world : my heart ’ s subdued even to the very quality of my lord . i saw othello ’ s visage in his mind , and to his honours and his valiant parts did i my soul and fortunes consecrate . so that , dear lords , if i be left behind , a moth of peace , and he go to the war , the rites for which i love him are bereft me , and i a heavy interim shall support by his dear absence . let me go with him .
shakespeare	othello	othello . let her have your voice . vouch with me , heaven , i therefore beg it not to please the palate of my appetite , nor to comply with heat , the young affects in me defunct , and proper satisfaction , but to be free and bounteous to her mind . and heaven defend your good souls that you think i will your serious and great business scant for she is with me . no , when light-wing ’ d toys of feather ’ d cupid seel with wanton dullness my speculative and offic ’ d instruments , that my disports corrupt and taint my business , let housewives make a skillet of my helm , and all indign and base adversities make head against my estimation .
shakespeare	othello	duke . be it as you shall privately determine , either for her stay or going . the affair cries haste , and speed must answer it . first senator . you must away tonight . othello . with all my heart .
shakespeare	othello	duke . at nine i ’ the morning here we ’ ll meet again . othello , leave some officer behind , and he shall our commission bring to you , with such things else of quality and respect as doth import you .
shakespeare	othello	othello . so please your grace , my ancient , a man he is of honesty and trust , to his conveyance i assign my wife , with what else needful your good grace shall think to be sent after me .
shakespeare	othello	duke . let it be so . good night to everyone . [ _to brabantio._ ] and , noble signior , if virtue no delighted beauty lack , your son-in-law is far more fair than black . first senator . adieu , brave moor , use desdemona well .
shakespeare	othello	brabantio . look to her , moor , if thou hast eyes to see : she has deceiv ’ d her father , and may thee . [ _exeunt duke , senators , officers , & c._ ] othello . my life upon her faith ! honest iago , my desdemona must i leave to thee . i prithee , let thy wife attend on her , and bring them after in the best advantage.— come , desdemona , i have but an hour of love , of worldly matters , and direction , to spend with thee . we must obey the time .
shakespeare	othello	[ _exeunt othello and desdemona._ ] roderigo . iago— iago . what sayst thou , noble heart ? roderigo . what will i do , thinkest thou ? iago . why , go to bed and sleep . roderigo . i will incontinently drown myself .
shakespeare	othello	iago . if thou dost , i shall never love thee after . why , thou silly gentleman ! roderigo . it is silliness to live , when to live is torment ; and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician .
shakespeare	othello	iago . o villainous ! i have looked upon the world for four times seven years , and since i could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury , i never found man that knew how to love himself . ere i would say i would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen , i would change my humanity with a baboon .
shakespeare	othello	roderigo . what should i do ? i confess it is my shame to be so fond , but it is not in my virtue to amend it . iago . virtue ! a fig ! ’ tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus . our bodies are gardens , to the which our wills are gardeners . so that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce , set hyssop and weed up thyme , supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many , either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry , why , the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills . if the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality , the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions . but we have reason to cool our raging motions , our carnal stings , our unbitted lusts ; whereof i take this , that you call love , to be a sect , or scion .
shakespeare	othello	roderigo . it can not be . iago . it is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will . come , be a man . drown thyself ? drown cats and blind puppies . i have professed me thy friend , and i confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness ; i could never better stead thee than now . put money in thy purse ; follow thou the wars ; defeat thy favour with an usurped beard ; i say , put money in thy purse . it can not be that desdemona should long continue her love to the moor , —put money in thy purse , —nor he his to her . it was a violent commencement , and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration—put but money in thy purse . these moors are changeable in their wills . fill thy purse with money . the food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as acerb as the coloquintida . she must change for youth . when she is sated with his body , she will find the error of her choice . she must have change , she must . therefore put money in thy purse . if thou wilt needs damn thyself , do it a more delicate way than drowning . make all the money thou canst . if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell , thou shalt enjoy her ; therefore make money . a pox of drowning thyself ! it is clean out of the way : seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her .
shakespeare	othello	roderigo . wilt thou be fast to my hopes if i depend on the issue ? iago . thou art sure of me . go , make money . i have told thee often , and i retell thee again and again , i hate the moor . my cause is hearted ; thine hath no less reason . let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him : if thou canst cuckold him , thou dost thyself a pleasure , me a sport . there are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered . traverse , go , provide thy money . we will have more of this tomorrow . adieu .
shakespeare	othello	roderigo . where shall we meet i ’ the morning ? iago . at my lodging . roderigo . i ’ ll be with thee betimes . iago . go to , farewell . do you hear , roderigo ? roderigo . what say you ?
shakespeare	othello	iago . no more of drowning , do you hear ? roderigo . i am changed . i ’ ll sell all my land . [ _exit._ ] iago . thus do i ever make my fool my purse . for i mine own gain ’ d knowledge should profane if i would time expend with such a snipe but for my sport and profit . i hate the moor , and it is thought abroad that ’ twixt my sheets he has done my office . i know not if ’ t be true , but i , for mere suspicion in that kind , will do as if for surety . he holds me well , the better shall my purpose work on him . cassio ’ s a proper man . let me see now , to get his place , and to plume up my will in double knavery . how , how ? let ’ s see . after some time , to abuse othello ’ s ear that he is too familiar with his wife . he hath a person and a smooth dispose , to be suspected , fram ’ d to make women false . the moor is of a free and open nature that thinks men honest that but seem to be so , and will as tenderly be led by the nose as asses are . i have ’ t . it is engender ’ d . hell and night must bring this monstrous birth to the world ’ s light .
shakespeare	othello	[ _exit._ ] act ii scene i . a seaport in cyprus . a platform . enter montano and two gentlemen . montano . what from the cape can you discern at sea ? first gentleman . nothing at all , it is a high-wrought flood . i can not ’ twixt the heaven and the main descry a sail .
shakespeare	othello	montano . methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land . a fuller blast ne ’ er shook our battlements . if it hath ruffian ’ d so upon the sea , what ribs of oak , when mountains melt on them , can hold the mortise ? what shall we hear of this ?
shakespeare	othello	second gentleman . a segregation of the turkish fleet . for do but stand upon the foaming shore , the chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds , the wind-shak ’ d surge , with high and monstrous main , seems to cast water on the burning bear , and quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole ; i never did like molestation view on the enchafed flood .
shakespeare	othello	montano . if that the turkish fleet be not enshelter ’ d , and embay ’ d , they are drown ’ d . it is impossible to bear it out . enter a third gentleman . third gentleman . news , lads ! our wars are done . the desperate tempest hath so bang ’ d the turks that their designment halts . a noble ship of venice hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance on most part of their fleet .
shakespeare	othello	montano . how ? is this true ? third gentleman . the ship is here put in , a veronessa ; michael cassio , lieutenant to the warlike moor othello , is come on shore ; the moor himself at sea , and is in full commission here for cyprus .
shakespeare	othello	montano . i am glad on ’ t . ’ tis a worthy governor . third gentleman . but this same cassio , though he speak of comfort touching the turkish loss , yet he looks sadly , and prays the moor be safe ; for they were parted with foul and violent tempest .
shakespeare	othello	montano . pray heavens he be ; for i have serv ’ d him , and the man commands like a full soldier . let ’ s to the sea-side , ho ! as well to see the vessel that ’ s come in as to throw out our eyes for brave othello , even till we make the main and the aerial blue an indistinct regard .
shakespeare	othello	third gentleman . come , let ’ s do so ; for every minute is expectancy of more arrivance . enter cassio . cassio . thanks you , the valiant of this warlike isle , that so approve the moor ! o , let the heavens give him defence against the elements , for i have lost him on a dangerous sea .
shakespeare	othello	montano . is he well shipp ’ d ? cassio . his bark is stoutly timber ’ d , and his pilot of very expert and approv ’ d allowance ; therefore my hopes , not surfeited to death , stand in bold cure .
shakespeare	othello	[ _within._ ] a sail , a sail , a sail ! enter a messenger . cassio . what noise ? messenger . the town is empty ; on the brow o ’ the sea stand ranks of people , and they cry “ a sail ! ”
shakespeare	othello	cassio . my hopes do shape him for the governor . [ _a shot._ ] second gentleman . they do discharge their shot of courtesy . our friends at least . cassio . i pray you , sir , go forth , and give us truth who ’ tis that is arriv ’ d .
shakespeare	othello	second gentleman . i shall . [ _exit._ ] montano . but , good lieutenant , is your general wiv ’ d ? cassio . most fortunately : he hath achiev ’ d a maid that paragons description and wild fame , one that excels the quirks of blazoning pens , and in the essential vesture of creation does tire the ingener .
shakespeare	othello	enter second gentleman . how now ? who has put in ? second gentleman . ’ tis one iago , ancient to the general . cassio . he has had most favourable and happy speed : tempests themselves , high seas , and howling winds , the gutter ’ d rocks , and congregated sands , traitors ensteep ’ d to clog the guiltless keel , as having sense of beauty , do omit their mortal natures , letting go safely by the divine desdemona .
shakespeare	othello	montano . what is she ? cassio . she that i spake of , our great captain ’ s captain , left in the conduct of the bold iago ; whose footing here anticipates our thoughts a se ’ nnight ’ s speed . great jove , othello guard , and swell his sail with thine own powerful breath , that he may bless this bay with his tall ship , make love ’ s quick pants in desdemona ’ s arms , give renew ’ d fire to our extincted spirits , and bring all cyprus comfort !
shakespeare	othello	enter desdemona , iago , roderigo , and emilia . o , behold , the riches of the ship is come on shore ! ye men of cyprus , let her have your knees . hail to thee , lady ! and the grace of heaven , before , behind thee , and on every hand , enwheel thee round !
shakespeare	othello	desdemona . i thank you , valiant cassio . what tidings can you tell me of my lord ? cassio . he is not yet arrived , nor know i aught but that he ’ s well , and will be shortly here .
shakespeare	othello	desdemona . o , but i fear—how lost you company ? [ _within._ ] a sail , a sail ! cassio . the great contention of the sea and skies parted our fellowship . but , hark ! a sail . [ _guns within._ ]
shakespeare	othello	second gentleman . they give their greeting to the citadel . this likewise is a friend . cassio . see for the news . [ _exit gentleman._ ] good ancient , you are welcome . [ _to emilia._ ] welcome , mistress . let it not gall your patience , good iago , that i extend my manners ; ’ tis my breeding that gives me this bold show of courtesy .
shakespeare	othello	[ _kissing her._ ] iago . sir , would she give you so much of her lips as of her tongue she oft bestows on me , you would have enough . desdemona . alas , she has no speech .
shakespeare	othello	iago . in faith , too much . i find it still when i have list to sleep . marry , before your ladyship , i grant , she puts her tongue a little in her heart , and chides with thinking .
shakespeare	othello	emilia . you have little cause to say so . iago . come on , come on ; you are pictures out of doors , bells in your parlours , wild-cats in your kitchens , saints in your injuries , devils being offended , players in your housewifery , and housewives in your beds .
shakespeare	othello	desdemona . o , fie upon thee , slanderer ! iago . nay , it is true , or else i am a turk . you rise to play , and go to bed to work . emilia . you shall not write my praise .
shakespeare	othello	iago . no , let me not . desdemona . what wouldst thou write of me , if thou shouldst praise me ? iago . o gentle lady , do not put me to ’ t , for i am nothing if not critical .
shakespeare	othello	desdemona . come on , assay.—there ’ s one gone to the harbour ? iago . ay , madam . desdemona . i am not merry , but i do beguile the thing i am , by seeming otherwise.— come , how wouldst thou praise me ?
shakespeare	othello	iago . i am about it , but indeed , my invention comes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze , it plucks out brains and all : but my muse labours , and thus she is deliver ’ d . if she be fair and wise , fairness and wit , the one ’ s for use , the other useth it .
shakespeare	othello	desdemona . well prais ’ d ! how if she be black and witty ? iago . if she be black , and thereto have a wit , she ’ ll find a white that shall her blackness fit . desdemona . worse and worse .
shakespeare	othello	emilia . how if fair and foolish ? iago . she never yet was foolish that was fair , for even her folly help ’ d her to an heir . desdemona . these are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i ’ the alehouse . what miserable praise hast thou for her that ’ s foul and foolish ?
shakespeare	othello	iago . there ’ s none so foul and foolish thereunto , but does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do . desdemona . o heavy ignorance ! thou praisest the worst best . but what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed , one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself ?
shakespeare	othello	iago . she that was ever fair and never proud , had tongue at will and yet was never loud , never lack ’ d gold and yet went never gay , fled from her wish , and yet said , “ now i may ” ; she that , being anger ’ d , her revenge being nigh , bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly ; she that in wisdom never was so frail to change the cod ’ s head for the salmon ’ s tail ; she that could think and ne ’ er disclose her mind , see suitors following and not look behind ; she was a wight , if ever such wight were—
shakespeare	othello	desdemona . to do what ? iago . to suckle fools and chronicle small beer . desdemona . o most lame and impotent conclusion ! —do not learn of him , emilia , though he be thy husband.—how say you , cassio ? is he not a most profane and liberal counsellor ?
shakespeare	othello	cassio . he speaks home , madam . you may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar . iago . [ _aside._ ] he takes her by the palm . ay , well said , whisper . with as little a web as this will i ensnare as great a fly as cassio . ay , smile upon her , do . i will gyve thee in thine own courtship . you say true , ’ tis so , indeed . if such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry , it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft , which now again you are most apt to play the sir in . very good ; well kissed , an excellent courtesy ! ’ tis so , indeed . yet again your fingers to your lips ? would they were clyster-pipes for your sake !
shakespeare	othello	[ _trumpets within._ ] the moor ! i know his trumpet . cassio . ’ tis truly so . desdemona . let ’ s meet him , and receive him . cassio . lo , where he comes ! enter othello and attendants . othello . o my fair warrior !
shakespeare	othello	desdemona . my dear othello ! othello . it gives me wonder great as my content to see you here before me . o my soul ’ s joy ! if after every tempest come such calms , may the winds blow till they have waken ’ d death ! and let the labouring bark climb hills of seas olympus-high , and duck again as low as hell ’ s from heaven ! if it were now to die , ’ twere now to be most happy , for i fear my soul hath her content so absolute that not another comfort like to this succeeds in unknown fate .
shakespeare	othello	desdemona . the heavens forbid but that our loves and comforts should increase even as our days do grow ! othello . amen to that , sweet powers ! i can not speak enough of this content . it stops me here ; it is too much of joy : and this , and this , the greatest discords be [ _they kiss._ ] that e ’ er our hearts shall make !
shakespeare	othello	iago . [ _aside._ ] o , you are well tun ’ d now , but i ’ ll set down the pegs that make this music , as honest as i am . othello . come , let us to the castle.— news , friends , our wars are done , the turks are drown ’ d . how does my old acquaintance of this isle ? honey , you shall be well desir ’ d in cyprus ; i have found great love amongst them . o my sweet , i prattle out of fashion , and i dote in mine own comforts.—i prithee , good iago , go to the bay and disembark my coffers . bring thou the master to the citadel ; he is a good one , and his worthiness does challenge much respect.—come , desdemona , once more well met at cyprus .
shakespeare	othello	[ _exeunt othello , desdemona and attendants._ ] iago . do thou meet me presently at the harbour . come hither . if thou be ’ st valiant—as , they say , base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them—list me . the lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard : first , i must tell thee this : desdemona is directly in love with him .
shakespeare	othello	roderigo . with him ? why , ’ tis not possible . iago . lay thy finger thus , and let thy soul be instructed . mark me with what violence she first loved the moor , but for bragging , and telling her fantastical lies . and will she love him still for prating ? let not thy discreet heart think it . her eye must be fed . and what delight shall she have to look on the devil ? when the blood is made dull with the act of sport , there should be , again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite , loveliness in favour , sympathy in years , manners , and beauties ; all which the moor is defective in : now , for want of these required conveniences , her delicate tenderness will find itself abused , begin to heave the gorge , disrelish and abhor the moor , very nature will instruct her in it , and compel her to some second choice . now sir , this granted ( as it is a most pregnant and unforced position ) who stands so eminently in the degree of this fortune as cassio does ? a knave very voluble ; no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming , for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection ? why , none , why , none ! a slipper and subtle knave , a finder out of occasions ; that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages , though true advantage never present itself : a devilish knave ! besides , the knave is handsome , young , and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after . a pestilent complete knave , and the woman hath found him already .
shakespeare	othello	roderigo . i can not believe that in her , she is full of most blessed condition . iago . blest fig ’ s end ! the wine she drinks is made of grapes : if she had been blessed , she would never have loved the moor . blessed pudding ! didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand ? didst not mark that ?
shakespeare	othello	roderigo . yes , that i did . but that was but courtesy . iago . lechery , by this hand . an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts . they met so near with their lips that their breaths embrac ’ d together . villainous thoughts , roderigo ! when these mutualities so marshal the way , hard at hand comes the master and main exercise , the incorporate conclusion . pish ! but , sir , be you ruled by me . i have brought you from venice . watch you tonight . for the command , i ’ ll lay ’ t upon you . cassio knows you not . i ’ ll not be far from you . do you find some occasion to anger cassio , either by speaking too loud , or tainting his discipline , or from what other course you please , which the time shall more favourably minister .
shakespeare	othello	roderigo . well . iago . sir , he is rash , and very sudden in choler , and haply with his truncheon may strike at you : provoke him that he may , for even out of that will i cause these of cyprus to mutiny , whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of cassio . so shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means i shall then have to prefer them , and the impediment most profitably removed , without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity .
shakespeare	othello	roderigo . i will do this , if i can bring it to any opportunity . iago . i warrant thee . meet me by and by at the citadel : i must fetch his necessaries ashore . farewell .
shakespeare	othello	roderigo . adieu . [ _exit._ ] iago . that cassio loves her , i do well believe it ; that she loves him , ’ tis apt , and of great credit : the moor , howbeit that i endure him not , is of a constant , loving , noble nature ; and , i dare think , he ’ ll prove to desdemona a most dear husband . now , i do love her too , not out of absolute lust ( though peradventure i stand accountant for as great a sin ) but partly led to diet my revenge , for that i do suspect the lusty moor hath leap ’ d into my seat . the thought whereof doth , like a poisonous mineral , gnaw my inwards , and nothing can or shall content my soul till i am even ’ d with him , wife for wife , or , failing so , yet that i put the moor at least into a jealousy so strong that judgement can not cure . which thing to do , if this poor trash of venice , whom i trash for his quick hunting , stand the putting on , i ’ ll have our michael cassio on the hip , abuse him to the moor in the rank garb ( for i fear cassio with my night-cap too ) make the moor thank me , love me , and reward me for making him egregiously an ass and practicing upon his peace and quiet even to madness . ’ tis here , but yet confus ’ d . knavery ’ s plain face is never seen till us ’ d .
shakespeare	othello	[ _exit._ ] scene ii . a street . enter othello ’ s herald with a proclamation . herald . it is othello ’ s pleasure , our noble and valiant general , that upon certain tidings now arrived , importing the mere perdition of the turkish fleet , every man put himself into triumph : some to dance , some to make bonfires , each man to what sport and revels his addition leads him . for besides these beneficial news , it is the celebration of his nuptial . so much was his pleasure should be proclaimed . all offices are open , and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five till the bell have told eleven . heaven bless the isle of cyprus and our noble general othello !
shakespeare	othello	[ _exit._ ] scene iii . a hall in the castle . enter othello , desdemona , cassio and attendants . othello . good michael , look you to the guard tonight . let ’ s teach ourselves that honourable stop , not to outsport discretion .
shakespeare	othello	cassio . iago hath direction what to do . but notwithstanding with my personal eye will i look to ’ t . othello . iago is most honest . michael , good night . tomorrow with your earliest let me have speech with you . [ _to desdemona._ ] come , my dear love , the purchase made , the fruits are to ensue ; that profit ’ s yet to come ’ tween me and you.— good night .
shakespeare	othello	[ _exeunt othello , desdemona and attendants._ ] enter iago . cassio . welcome , iago . we must to the watch . iago . not this hour , lieutenant . ’ tis not yet ten o ’ th ’ clock . our general cast us thus early for the love of his desdemona ; who let us not therefore blame : he hath not yet made wanton the night with her ; and she is sport for jove .
shakespeare	othello	cassio . she ’ s a most exquisite lady . iago . and , i ’ ll warrant her , full of game . cassio . indeed , she is a most fresh and delicate creature . iago . what an eye she has ! methinks it sounds a parley to provocation .
shakespeare	othello	cassio . an inviting eye , and yet methinks right modest . iago . and when she speaks , is it not an alarm to love ? cassio . she is indeed perfection . iago . well , happiness to their sheets ! come , lieutenant , i have a stoup of wine ; and here without are a brace of cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black othello .
shakespeare	othello	cassio . not tonight , good iago . i have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking . i could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment . iago . o , they are our friends ; but one cup : i ’ ll drink for you .
shakespeare	othello	cassio . i have drunk but one cup tonight , and that was craftily qualified too , and behold , what innovation it makes here : i am unfortunate in the infirmity , and dare not task my weakness with any more .
shakespeare	othello	iago . what , man ! ’ tis a night of revels . the gallants desire it . cassio . where are they ? iago . here at the door . i pray you , call them in . cassio . i ’ ll do ’ t ; but it dislikes me .
shakespeare	othello	[ _exit._ ] iago . if i can fasten but one cup upon him , with that which he hath drunk tonight already , he ’ ll be as full of quarrel and offence as my young mistress ’ dog . now my sick fool roderigo , whom love hath turn ’ d almost the wrong side out , to desdemona hath tonight carous ’ d potations pottle-deep ; and he ’ s to watch : three lads of cyprus , noble swelling spirits , that hold their honours in a wary distance , the very elements of this warlike isle , have i tonight fluster ’ d with flowing cups , and they watch too . now , ’ mongst this flock of drunkards , am i to put our cassio in some action that may offend the isle . but here they come : if consequence do but approve my dream , my boat sails freely , both with wind and stream .
shakespeare	othello	enter cassio , montano and gentlemen ; followed by servant with wine . cassio . ’ fore god , they have given me a rouse already . montano . good faith , a little one ; not past a pint , as i am a soldier .
shakespeare	othello	iago . some wine , ho ! [ _sings._ ] _and let me the cannikin clink , clink , and let me the cannikin clink , clink : a soldier ’ s a man , o , man ’ s life ’ s but a span , why then let a soldier drink._
shakespeare	othello	some wine , boys ! cassio . ’ fore god , an excellent song . iago . i learned it in england , where indeed they are most potent in potting : your dane , your german , and your swag-bellied hollander , —drink , ho ! —are nothing to your english .
shakespeare	othello	cassio . is your englishman so expert in his drinking ? iago . why , he drinks you , with facility , your dane dead drunk ; he sweats not to overthrow your almain ; he gives your hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled .
shakespeare	othello	cassio . to the health of our general ! montano . i am for it , lieutenant ; and i ’ ll do you justice . iago . o sweet england ! [ _sings._ ] _king stephen was a worthy peer , his breeches cost him but a crown ; he held them sixpence all too dear , with that he call ’ d the tailor lown . he was a wight of high renown , and thou art but of low degree : ’ tis pride that pulls the country down , then take thine auld cloak about thee._
shakespeare	othello	some wine , ho ! cassio . ’ fore god , this is a more exquisite song than the other . iago . will you hear ’ t again ? cassio . no , for i hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things . well , god ’ s above all , and there be souls must be saved , and there be souls must not be saved .
shakespeare	othello	iago . it ’ s true , good lieutenant . cassio . for mine own part , no offence to the general , nor any man of quality , i hope to be saved . iago . and so do i too , lieutenant .
shakespeare	othello	cassio . ay , but , by your leave , not before me ; the lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient . let ’ s have no more of this ; let ’ s to our affairs . forgive us our sins ! gentlemen , let ’ s look to our business . do not think , gentlemen , i am drunk . this is my ancient , this is my right hand , and this is my left . i am not drunk now . i can stand well enough , and i speak well enough .
shakespeare	othello	all . excellent well . cassio . why , very well then . you must not think , then , that i am drunk . [ _exit._ ] montano . to the platform , masters . come , let ’ s set the watch . iago . you see this fellow that is gone before , he is a soldier fit to stand by cæsar and give direction : and do but see his vice , ’ tis to his virtue a just equinox , the one as long as th ’ other . ’ tis pity of him . i fear the trust othello puts him in , on some odd time of his infirmity , will shake this island .
shakespeare	othello	montano . but is he often thus ? iago . ’ tis evermore the prologue to his sleep : he ’ ll watch the horologe a double set if drink rock not his cradle . montano . it were well the general were put in mind of it . perhaps he sees it not , or his good nature prizes the virtue that appears in cassio , and looks not on his evils : is not this true ?
shakespeare	othello	enter roderigo . iago . [ _aside to him._ ] how now , roderigo ? i pray you , after the lieutenant ; go . [ _exit roderigo._ ] montano . and ’ tis great pity that the noble moor should hazard such a place as his own second with one of an ingraft infirmity : it were an honest action to say so to the moor .
shakespeare	othello	iago . not i , for this fair island . i do love cassio well and would do much to cure him of this evil . but , hark ! what noise ? [ _cry within_ : “ help ! help ! ” ]
shakespeare	othello	enter cassio , driving in roderigo . cassio . zounds , you rogue , you rascal ! montano . what ’ s the matter , lieutenant ? cassio . a knave teach me my duty ! i ’ ll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle .
shakespeare	othello	roderigo . beat me ? cassio . dost thou prate , rogue ? [ _striking roderigo._ ] montano . nay , good lieutenant ; i pray you , sir , hold your hand . cassio . let me go , sir , or i ’ ll knock you o ’ er the mazard .
shakespeare	othello	montano . come , come , you ’ re drunk . cassio . drunk ? [ _they fight._ ] iago . [ _aside to roderigo._ ] away , i say ! go out and cry a mutiny . [ _exit roderigo._ ] nay , good lieutenant , god ’ s will , gentlemen . help , ho ! —lieutenant , —sir , —montano , —sir : — help , masters ! here ’ s a goodly watch indeed !
shakespeare	othello	[ _a bell rings._ ] who ’ s that which rings the bell ? —diablo , ho ! the town will rise . god ’ s will , lieutenant , hold , you will be sham ’ d forever . enter othello and attendants . othello . what is the matter here ?
shakespeare	othello	montano . zounds , i bleed still , i am hurt to the death . othello . hold , for your lives ! iago . hold , ho ! lieutenant , —sir , —montano , —gentlemen , — have you forgot all place of sense and duty ? hold ! the general speaks to you ; hold , hold , for shame !
shakespeare	othello	othello . why , how now , ho ! from whence ariseth this ? are we turn ’ d turks , and to ourselves do that which heaven hath forbid the ottomites ? for christian shame , put by this barbarous brawl : he that stirs next to carve for his own rage holds his soul light ; he dies upon his motion . silence that dreadful bell , it frights the isle from her propriety . what is the matter , masters ? honest iago , that looks dead with grieving , speak , who began this ? on thy love , i charge thee .
shakespeare	othello	iago . i do not know . friends all but now , even now , in quarter , and in terms like bride and groom devesting them for bed ; and then , but now , as if some planet had unwitted men , swords out , and tilting one at other ’ s breast , in opposition bloody . i can not speak any beginning to this peevish odds ; and would in action glorious i had lost those legs that brought me to a part of it !
shakespeare	othello	othello . how comes it , michael , you are thus forgot ? cassio . i pray you , pardon me ; i can not speak . othello . worthy montano , you were wont be civil . the gravity and stillness of your youth the world hath noted , and your name is great in mouths of wisest censure : what ’ s the matter , that you unlace your reputation thus , and spend your rich opinion for the name of a night-brawler ? give me answer to it .
shakespeare	othello	montano . worthy othello , i am hurt to danger . your officer , iago , can inform you , while i spare speech , which something now offends me , of all that i do know ; nor know i aught by me that ’ s said or done amiss this night , unless self-charity be sometimes a vice , and to defend ourselves it be a sin when violence assails us .
shakespeare	othello	othello . now , by heaven , my blood begins my safer guides to rule , and passion , having my best judgement collied , assays to lead the way . zounds , if i stir , or do but lift this arm , the best of you shall sink in my rebuke . give me to know how this foul rout began , who set it on , and he that is approv ’ d in this offence , though he had twinn ’ d with me , both at a birth , shall lose me . what ! in a town of war , yet wild , the people ’ s hearts brimful of fear , to manage private and domestic quarrel , in night , and on the court and guard of safety ? ’ tis monstrous . iago , who began ’ t ?
shakespeare	othello	montano . if partially affin ’ d , or leagu ’ d in office , thou dost deliver more or less than truth , thou art no soldier . iago . touch me not so near . i had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth than it should do offence to michael cassio . yet i persuade myself , to speak the truth shall nothing wrong him . thus it is , general : montano and myself being in speech , there comes a fellow crying out for help , and cassio following him with determin ’ d sword , to execute upon him . sir , this gentleman steps in to cassio and entreats his pause . myself the crying fellow did pursue , lest by his clamour ( as it so fell out ) the town might fall in fright : he , swift of foot , outran my purpose : and i return ’ d the rather for that i heard the clink and fall of swords , and cassio high in oath , which till tonight i ne ’ er might say before . when i came back , ( for this was brief ) i found them close together , at blow and thrust , even as again they were when you yourself did part them . more of this matter can not i report . but men are men ; the best sometimes forget ; though cassio did some little wrong to him , as men in rage strike those that wish them best , yet surely cassio , i believe , receiv ’ d from him that fled some strange indignity , which patience could not pass .
shakespeare	othello	othello . i know , iago , thy honesty and love doth mince this matter , making it light to cassio . cassio , i love thee , but never more be officer of mine . enter desdemona , attended .
shakespeare	othello	look , if my gentle love be not rais ’ d up ! i ’ ll make thee an example . desdemona . what ’ s the matter ? othello . all ’ s well now , sweeting ; come away to bed . sir , for your hurts , myself will be your surgeon . lead him off .
shakespeare	othello	[ _montano is led off._ ] iago , look with care about the town , and silence those whom this vile brawl distracted . come , desdemona : ’ tis the soldiers ’ life to have their balmy slumbers wak ’ d with strife .
shakespeare	othello	[ _exeunt all but iago and cassio._ ] iago . what , are you hurt , lieutenant ? cassio . ay , past all surgery . iago . marry , heaven forbid ! cassio . reputation , reputation , reputation ! o , i have lost my reputation ! i have lost the immortal part of myself , and what remains is bestial . my reputation , iago , my reputation !
shakespeare	othello	iago . as i am an honest man , i thought you had received some bodily wound ; there is more sense in that than in reputation . reputation is an idle and most false imposition , oft got without merit and lost without deserving . you have lost no reputation at all , unless you repute yourself such a loser . what , man , there are ways to recover the general again : you are but now cast in his mood , a punishment more in policy than in malice , even so as one would beat his offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion : sue to him again , and he ’ s yours .
shakespeare	othello	cassio . i will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight , so drunken , and so indiscreet an officer . drunk ? and speak parrot ? and squabble ? swagger ? swear ? and discourse fustian with one ’ s own shadow ? o thou invisible spirit of wine , if thou hast no name to be known by , let us call thee devil !
shakespeare	othello	iago . what was he that you followed with your sword ? what had he done to you ? cassio . i know not . iago . is ’ t possible ? cassio . i remember a mass of things , but nothing distinctly ; a quarrel , but nothing wherefore . o god , that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains ! that we should with joy , pleasance , revel , and applause , transform ourselves into beasts !
shakespeare	othello	iago . why , but you are now well enough : how came you thus recovered ? cassio . it hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath . one unperfectness shows me another , to make me frankly despise myself .
shakespeare	othello	iago . come , you are too severe a moraler . as the time , the place , and the condition of this country stands , i could heartily wish this had not befallen ; but since it is as it is , mend it for your own good .
shakespeare	othello	cassio . i will ask him for my place again ; he shall tell me i am a drunkard ! had i as many mouths as hydra , such an answer would stop them all . to be now a sensible man , by and by a fool , and presently a beast ! o strange ! every inordinate cup is unbless ’ d , and the ingredient is a devil .
shakespeare	othello	iago . come , come , good wine is a good familiar creature , if it be well used . exclaim no more against it . and , good lieutenant , i think you think i love you .
shakespeare	othello	cassio . i have well approved it , sir.—i drunk ! iago . you , or any man living , may be drunk at a time , man . i ’ ll tell you what you shall do . our general ’ s wife is now the general ; i may say so in this respect , for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation , mark , and denotement of her parts and graces . confess yourself freely to her . importune her help to put you in your place again . she is of so free , so kind , so apt , so blessed a disposition , she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested . this broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter , and , my fortunes against any lay worth naming , this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before .
shakespeare	othello	cassio . you advise me well . iago . i protest , in the sincerity of love and honest kindness . cassio . i think it freely ; and betimes in the morning i will beseech the virtuous desdemona to undertake for me ; i am desperate of my fortunes if they check me here .
shakespeare	othello	iago . you are in the right . good night , lieutenant , i must to the watch . cassio . good night , honest iago . [ _exit._ ] iago . and what ’ s he then , that says i play the villain ? when this advice is free i give and honest , probal to thinking , and indeed the course to win the moor again ? for ’ tis most easy the inclining desdemona to subdue in any honest suit . she ’ s fram ’ d as fruitful as the free elements . and then for her to win the moor , were ’ t to renounce his baptism , all seals and symbols of redeemed sin , his soul is so enfetter ’ d to her love that she may make , unmake , do what she list , even as her appetite shall play the god with his weak function . how am i then , a villain to counsel cassio to this parallel course , directly to his good ? divinity of hell ! when devils will the blackest sins put on , they do suggest at first with heavenly shows , as i do now : for whiles this honest fool plies desdemona to repair his fortune , and she for him pleads strongly to the moor , i ’ ll pour this pestilence into his ear , that she repeals him for her body ’ s lust ; and by how much she strives to do him good , she shall undo her credit with the moor . so will i turn her virtue into pitch , and out of her own goodness make the net that shall enmesh them all .
shakespeare	othello	enter roderigo . how now , roderigo ? roderigo . i do follow here in the chase , not like a hound that hunts , but one that fills up the cry . my money is almost spent , i have been tonight exceedingly well cudgelled ; and i think the issue will be , i shall have so much experience for my pains , and so , with no money at all and a little more wit , return again to venice .
shakespeare	othello	iago . how poor are they that have not patience ! what wound did ever heal but by degrees ? thou know ’ st we work by wit , and not by witchcraft , and wit depends on dilatory time . does ’ t not go well ? cassio hath beaten thee , and thou , by that small hurt , hast cashier ’ d cassio ; though other things grow fair against the sun , yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe . content thyself awhile . by the mass , ’ tis morning ; pleasure and action make the hours seem short . retire thee ; go where thou art billeted . away , i say , thou shalt know more hereafter . nay , get thee gone .
shakespeare	othello	[ _exit roderigo._ ] two things are to be done , my wife must move for cassio to her mistress . i ’ ll set her on ; myself the while to draw the moor apart , and bring him jump when he may cassio find soliciting his wife . ay , that ’ s the way . dull not device by coldness and delay .
shakespeare	othello	[ _exit._ ] act iii scene i. cyprus . before the castle . enter cassio and some musicians . cassio . masters , play here , i will content your pains , something that ’ s brief ; and bid “ good morrow , general . ”
shakespeare	othello	[ _music._ ] enter clown . clown . why , masters , have your instruments been in naples , that they speak i ’ the nose thus ? first musician . how , sir , how ? clown . are these , i pray you , wind instruments ?
shakespeare	othello	first musician . ay , marry , are they , sir . clown . o , thereby hangs a tail . first musician . whereby hangs a tale , sir ? clown . marry , sir , by many a wind instrument that i know . but , masters , here ’ s money for you : and the general so likes your music , that he desires you , for love ’ s sake , to make no more noise with it .
shakespeare	othello	first musician . well , sir , we will not . clown . if you have any music that may not be heard , to ’ t again . but , as they say , to hear music the general does not greatly care .
shakespeare	othello	first musician . we have none such , sir . clown . then put up your pipes in your bag , for i ’ ll away . go , vanish into air , away ! [ _exeunt musicians._ ] cassio . dost thou hear , mine honest friend ?
shakespeare	othello	clown . no , i hear not your honest friend . i hear you . cassio . prithee , keep up thy quillets . there ’ s a poor piece of gold for thee : if the gentlewoman that attends the general ’ s wife be stirring , tell her there ’ s one cassio entreats her a little favour of speech . wilt thou do this ?
shakespeare	othello	clown . she is stirring , sir ; if she will stir hither , i shall seem to notify unto her . cassio . do , good my friend . [ _exit clown._ ] enter iago . in happy time , iago .
shakespeare	othello	iago . you have not been a-bed , then ? cassio . why , no . the day had broke before we parted . i have made bold , iago , to send in to your wife . my suit to her is , that she will to virtuous desdemona procure me some access .
shakespeare	othello	iago . i ’ ll send her to you presently , and i ’ ll devise a mean to draw the moor out of the way , that your converse and business may be more free . cassio . i humbly thank you for ’ t .
shakespeare	othello	[ _exit iago._ ] i never knew a florentine more kind and honest . enter emilia . emilia . good morrow , good lieutenant ; i am sorry for your displeasure , but all will sure be well . the general and his wife are talking of it , and she speaks for you stoutly : the moor replies that he you hurt is of great fame in cyprus and great affinity , and that in wholesome wisdom he might not but refuse you ; but he protests he loves you and needs no other suitor but his likings to take the safest occasion by the front to bring you in again .
shakespeare	othello	cassio . yet , i beseech you , if you think fit , or that it may be done , give me advantage of some brief discourse with desdemona alone . emilia . pray you , come in . i will bestow you where you shall have time to speak your bosom freely .
shakespeare	othello	cassio . i am much bound to you . [ _exeunt._ ] scene ii . cyprus . a room in the castle . enter othello , iago and gentlemen . othello . these letters give , iago , to the pilot , and by him do my duties to the senate . that done , i will be walking on the works , repair there to me .
shakespeare	othello	iago . well , my good lord , i ’ ll do ’ t . othello . this fortification , gentlemen , shall we see ’ t ? gentlemen . we ’ ll wait upon your lordship . [ _exeunt._ ] scene iii . cyprus . the garden of the castle . enter desdemona , cassio and emilia .
shakespeare	othello	desdemona . be thou assured , good cassio , i will do all my abilities in thy behalf . emilia . good madam , do . i warrant it grieves my husband as if the cause were his .
shakespeare	othello	desdemona . o , that ’ s an honest fellow . do not doubt , cassio , but i will have my lord and you again as friendly as you were . cassio . bounteous madam , whatever shall become of michael cassio , he ’ s never anything but your true servant .
shakespeare	othello	desdemona . i know ’ t . i thank you . you do love my lord . you have known him long ; and be you well assur ’ d he shall in strangeness stand no farther off than in a politic distance .
shakespeare	othello	cassio . ay , but , lady , that policy may either last so long , or feed upon such nice and waterish diet , or breed itself so out of circumstance , that , i being absent , and my place supplied , my general will forget my love and service .
shakespeare	othello	desdemona . do not doubt that . before emilia here i give thee warrant of thy place . assure thee , if i do vow a friendship , i ’ ll perform it to the last article . my lord shall never rest , i ’ ll watch him tame , and talk him out of patience ; his bed shall seem a school , his board a shrift ; i ’ ll intermingle everything he does with cassio ’ s suit . therefore be merry , cassio , for thy solicitor shall rather die than give thy cause away .
shakespeare	othello	enter othello and iago . emilia . madam , here comes my lord . cassio . madam , i ’ ll take my leave . desdemona . why , stay , and hear me speak . cassio . madam , not now . i am very ill at ease , unfit for mine own purposes .
shakespeare	othello	desdemona . well , do your discretion . [ _exit cassio._ ] iago . ha , i like not that . othello . what dost thou say ? iago . nothing , my lord ; or if—i know not what . othello . was not that cassio parted from my wife ?
shakespeare	othello	iago . cassio , my lord ? no , sure , i can not think it , that he would steal away so guilty-like , seeing you coming . othello . i do believe ’ twas he . desdemona . how now , my lord ? i have been talking with a suitor here , a man that languishes in your displeasure .
shakespeare	othello	othello . who is ’ t you mean ? desdemona . why , your lieutenant , cassio . good my lord , if i have any grace or power to move you , his present reconciliation take ; for if he be not one that truly loves you , that errs in ignorance and not in cunning , i have no judgement in an honest face . i prithee call him back .
shakespeare	othello	othello . went he hence now ? desdemona . ay , sooth ; so humbled that he hath left part of his grief with me to suffer with him . good love , call him back . othello . not now , sweet desdemon , some other time .
shakespeare	othello	desdemona . but shall ’ t be shortly ? othello . the sooner , sweet , for you . desdemona . shall ’ t be tonight at supper ? othello . no , not tonight . desdemona . tomorrow dinner then ? othello . i shall not dine at home ; i meet the captains at the citadel .
shakespeare	othello	desdemona . why then tomorrow night , or tuesday morn , on tuesday noon , or night ; on wednesday morn . i prithee name the time , but let it not exceed three days . in faith , he ’ s penitent ; and yet his trespass , in our common reason , ( save that , they say , the wars must make examples out of their best ) is not almost a fault to incur a private check . when shall he come ? tell me , othello : i wonder in my soul , what you would ask me , that i should deny , or stand so mammering on . what ? michael cassio , that came a-wooing with you , and so many a time , when i have spoke of you dispraisingly , hath ta ’ en your part , to have so much to do to bring him in ! trust me , i could do much .
shakespeare	othello	othello . prithee no more . let him come when he will ; i will deny thee nothing . desdemona . why , this is not a boon ; ’ tis as i should entreat you wear your gloves , or feed on nourishing dishes , or keep you warm , or sue to you to do a peculiar profit to your own person : nay , when i have a suit wherein i mean to touch your love indeed , it shall be full of poise and difficult weight , and fearful to be granted .
shakespeare	othello	othello . i will deny thee nothing . whereon , i do beseech thee , grant me this , to leave me but a little to myself . desdemona . shall i deny you ? no , farewell , my lord .
shakespeare	othello	othello . farewell , my desdemona . i ’ ll come to thee straight . desdemona . emilia , come . be as your fancies teach you . whate ’ er you be , i am obedient . [ _exit with emilia._ ] othello . excellent wretch ! perdition catch my soul , but i do love thee ! and when i love thee not , chaos is come again .
shakespeare	othello	iago . my noble lord , — othello . what dost thou say , iago ? iago . did michael cassio , when you woo ’ d my lady , know of your love ? othello . he did , from first to last . why dost thou ask ?
shakespeare	othello	iago . but for a satisfaction of my thought . no further harm . othello . why of thy thought , iago ? iago . i did not think he had been acquainted with her . othello . o yes , and went between us very oft .
shakespeare	othello	iago . indeed ? othello . indeed ? ay , indeed . discern ’ st thou aught in that ? is he not honest ? iago . honest , my lord ? othello . honest ? ay , honest . iago . my lord , for aught i know .
shakespeare	othello	othello . what dost thou think ? iago . think , my lord ? othello . think , my lord ? by heaven , he echoes me , as if there were some monster in his thought too hideous to be shown . thou dost mean something . i heard thee say even now , thou lik ’ st not that , when cassio left my wife . what didst not like ? and when i told thee he was of my counsel in my whole course of wooing , thou criedst , “ indeed ? ” and didst contract and purse thy brow together , as if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain some horrible conceit : if thou dost love me , show me thy thought .
shakespeare	othello	iago . my lord , you know i love you . othello . i think thou dost ; and for i know thou ’ rt full of love and honesty and weigh ’ st thy words before thou giv ’ st them breath , therefore these stops of thine fright me the more : for such things in a false disloyal knave are tricks of custom ; but in a man that ’ s just , they ’ re close dilations , working from the heart , that passion can not rule .
shakespeare	othello	iago . for michael cassio , i dare be sworn i think that he is honest . othello . i think so too . iago . men should be what they seem ; or those that be not , would they might seem none !
shakespeare	othello	othello . certain , men should be what they seem . iago . why then , i think cassio ’ s an honest man . othello . nay , yet there ’ s more in this : i prithee , speak to me as to thy thinkings , as thou dost ruminate , and give thy worst of thoughts the worst of words .
shakespeare	othello	iago . good my lord , pardon me . though i am bound to every act of duty , i am not bound to that all slaves are free to . utter my thoughts ? why , say they are vile and false : as where ’ s that palace whereinto foul things sometimes intrude not ? who has a breast so pure but some uncleanly apprehensions keep leets and law-days , and in session sit with meditations lawful ?
shakespeare	othello	othello . thou dost conspire against thy friend , iago , if thou but think ’ st him wrong ’ d and mak ’ st his ear a stranger to thy thoughts . iago . i do beseech you , though i perchance am vicious in my guess , as , i confess , it is my nature ’ s plague to spy into abuses , and of my jealousy shapes faults that are not , —that your wisdom from one that so imperfectly conceits , would take no notice ; nor build yourself a trouble out of his scattering and unsure observance . it were not for your quiet nor your good , nor for my manhood , honesty , or wisdom , to let you know my thoughts .
shakespeare	othello	othello . what dost thou mean ? iago . good name in man and woman , dear my lord , is the immediate jewel of their souls . who steals my purse steals trash . ’ tis something , nothing ; ’ twas mine , ’ tis his , and has been slave to thousands . but he that filches from me my good name robs me of that which not enriches him and makes me poor indeed .
shakespeare	othello	othello . by heaven , i ’ ll know thy thoughts . iago . you can not , if my heart were in your hand , nor shall not , whilst ’ tis in my custody . othello . ha ? iago . o , beware , my lord , of jealousy ; it is the green-ey ’ d monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on . that cuckold lives in bliss who , certain of his fate , loves not his wronger ; but o , what damned minutes tells he o ’ er who dotes , yet doubts , suspects , yet strongly loves !
shakespeare	othello	othello . o misery ! iago . poor and content is rich , and rich enough ; but riches fineless is as poor as winter to him that ever fears he shall be poor . good heaven , the souls of all my tribe defend from jealousy !
shakespeare	othello	othello . why , why is this ? think ’ st thou i ’ d make a life of jealousy , to follow still the changes of the moon with fresh suspicions ? no . to be once in doubt is once to be resolv ’ d : exchange me for a goat when i shall turn the business of my soul to such exsufflicate and blown surmises , matching thy inference . ’ tis not to make me jealous , to say my wife is fair , feeds well , loves company , is free of speech , sings , plays , and dances well ; where virtue is , these are more virtuous : nor from mine own weak merits will i draw the smallest fear or doubt of her revolt , for she had eyes , and chose me . no , iago , i ’ ll see before i doubt ; when i doubt , prove ; and on the proof , there is no more but this : away at once with love or jealousy !
shakespeare	othello	iago . i am glad of it , for now i shall have reason to show the love and duty that i bear you with franker spirit : therefore , as i am bound , receive it from me . i speak not yet of proof . look to your wife ; observe her well with cassio ; wear your eye thus , not jealous nor secure . i would not have your free and noble nature , out of self-bounty , be abus ’ d . look to ’ t . i know our country disposition well ; in venice they do let heaven see the pranks they dare not show their husbands . their best conscience is not to leave undone , but keep unknown .
shakespeare	othello	othello . dost thou say so ? iago . she did deceive her father , marrying you ; and when she seem ’ d to shake and fear your looks , she loved them most . othello . and so she did .
shakespeare	othello	iago . why , go to then . she that so young could give out such a seeming , to seal her father ’ s eyes up close as oak , he thought ’ twas witchcraft . but i am much to blame . i humbly do beseech you of your pardon for too much loving you .
shakespeare	othello	othello . i am bound to thee for ever . iago . i see this hath a little dash ’ d your spirits . othello . not a jot , not a jot . iago . trust me , i fear it has . i hope you will consider what is spoke comes from my love . but i do see you ’ re mov ’ d . i am to pray you not to strain my speech to grosser issues nor to larger reach than to suspicion .
shakespeare	othello	othello . i will not . iago . should you do so , my lord , my speech should fall into such vile success which my thoughts aim ’ d not . cassio ’ s my worthy friend . my lord , i see you ’ re mov ’ d .
shakespeare	othello	othello . no , not much mov ’ d . i do not think but desdemona ’ s honest . iago . long live she so ! and long live you to think so ! othello . and yet , how nature erring from itself—
shakespeare	othello	iago . ay , there ’ s the point . as , to be bold with you , not to affect many proposed matches , of her own clime , complexion , and degree , whereto we see in all things nature tends ; foh ! one may smell in such a will most rank , foul disproportion , thoughts unnatural . but pardon me : i do not in position distinctly speak of her , though i may fear her will , recoiling to her better judgement , may fall to match you with her country forms , and happily repent .
shakespeare	othello	othello . farewell , farewell : if more thou dost perceive , let me know more ; set on thy wife to observe . leave me , iago . iago . [ _going._ ] my lord , i take my leave . othello . why did i marry ? this honest creature doubtless sees and knows more , much more , than he unfolds .
shakespeare	othello	iago . [ _returning._ ] my lord , i would i might entreat your honour to scan this thing no further . leave it to time : though it be fit that cassio have his place , for sure he fills it up with great ability , yet if you please to hold him off awhile , you shall by that perceive him and his means . note if your lady strain his entertainment with any strong or vehement importunity , much will be seen in that . in the meantime , let me be thought too busy in my fears ( as worthy cause i have to fear i am ) and hold her free , i do beseech your honour .
shakespeare	othello	othello . fear not my government . iago . i once more take my leave . [ _exit._ ] othello . this fellow ’ s of exceeding honesty , and knows all qualities , with a learned spirit , of human dealings . if i do prove her haggard , though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings , i ’ d whistle her off , and let her down the wind to prey at fortune . haply , for i am black , and have not those soft parts of conversation that chamberers have , or for i am declin ’ d into the vale of years , —yet that ’ s not much— she ’ s gone , i am abus ’ d , and my relief must be to loathe her . o curse of marriage , that we can call these delicate creatures ours , and not their appetites ! i had rather be a toad , and live upon the vapour of a dungeon , than keep a corner in the thing i love for others ’ uses . yet , ’ tis the plague of great ones , prerogativ ’ d are they less than the base , ’ tis destiny unshunnable , like death : even then this forked plague is fated to us when we do quicken . desdemona comes . if she be false , o , then heaven mocks itself ! i ’ ll not believe ’ t .
shakespeare	othello	enter desdemona and emilia . desdemona . how now , my dear othello ? your dinner , and the generous islanders by you invited , do attend your presence . othello . i am to blame . desdemona . why do you speak so faintly ? are you not well ?
shakespeare	othello	othello . i have a pain upon my forehead here . desdemona . faith , that ’ s with watching , ’ twill away again ; let me but bind it hard , within this hour it will be well .
shakespeare	othello	othello . your napkin is too little ; [ _he puts the handkerchief from him , and she drops it._ ] let it alone . come , i ’ ll go in with you . desdemona . i am very sorry that you are not well .
shakespeare	othello	[ _exeunt othello and desdemona._ ] emilia . i am glad i have found this napkin ; this was her first remembrance from the moor . my wayward husband hath a hundred times woo ’ d me to steal it . but she so loves the token , for he conjur ’ d her she should ever keep it , that she reserves it evermore about her to kiss and talk to . i ’ ll have the work ta ’ en out , and give ’ t iago . what he will do with it heaven knows , not i , i nothing but to please his fantasy .
shakespeare	othello	enter iago . iago . how now ? what do you here alone ? emilia . do not you chide . i have a thing for you . iago . a thing for me ? it is a common thing—
shakespeare	othello	emilia . ha ? iago . to have a foolish wife . emilia . o , is that all ? what will you give me now for that same handkerchief ? iago . what handkerchief ? emilia . what handkerchief ? why , that the moor first gave to desdemona , that which so often you did bid me steal .
shakespeare	othello	iago . hast stol ’ n it from her ? emilia . no , faith , she let it drop by negligence , and , to the advantage , i being here , took ’ t up . look , here it is . iago . a good wench , give it me .
shakespeare	othello	emilia . what will you do with ’ t , that you have been so earnest to have me filch it ? iago . [ _snatching it._ ] why , what ’ s that to you ? emilia . if it be not for some purpose of import , give ’ t me again . poor lady , she ’ ll run mad when she shall lack it .
shakespeare	othello	iago . be not acknown on ’ t , i have use for it . go , leave me . [ _exit emilia._ ] i will in cassio ’ s lodging lose this napkin , and let him find it . trifles light as air are to the jealous confirmations strong as proofs of holy writ . this may do something . the moor already changes with my poison : dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons , which at the first are scarce found to distaste , but with a little act upon the blood burn like the mines of sulphur . i did say so .
shakespeare	othello	enter othello . look , where he comes . not poppy , nor mandragora , nor all the drowsy syrups of the world , shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep which thou ow ’ dst yesterday .
shakespeare	othello	othello . ha ! ha ! false to me ? iago . why , how now , general ? no more of that . othello . avaunt ! be gone ! thou hast set me on the rack . i swear ’ tis better to be much abus ’ d than but to know ’ t a little .
shakespeare	othello	iago . how now , my lord ? othello . what sense had i of her stol ’ n hours of lust ? i saw ’ t not , thought it not , it harm ’ d not me . i slept the next night well , was free and merry ; i found not cassio ’ s kisses on her lips . he that is robb ’ d , not wanting what is stol ’ n , let him not know ’ t , and he ’ s not robb ’ d at all .
shakespeare	othello	iago . i am sorry to hear this . othello . i had been happy if the general camp , pioners and all , had tasted her sweet body , so i had nothing known . o , now , for ever farewell the tranquil mind ! farewell content ! farewell the plumed troops and the big wars that make ambition virtue ! o , farewell , farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump , the spirit-stirring drum , the ear-piercing fife , the royal banner , and all quality , pride , pomp , and circumstance of glorious war ! and , o you mortal engines , whose rude throats the immortal jove ’ s dread clamours counterfeit , farewell ! othello ’ s occupation ’ s gone !
shakespeare	othello	iago . is ’ t possible , my lord ? othello . villain , be sure thou prove my love a whore ; be sure of it . give me the ocular proof , or , by the worth of man ’ s eternal soul , thou hadst been better have been born a dog than answer my wak ’ d wrath .
shakespeare	othello	iago . is ’ t come to this ? othello . make me to see ’ t , or at the least so prove it , that the probation bear no hinge nor loop to hang a doubt on , or woe upon thy life !
shakespeare	othello	iago . my noble lord , — othello . if thou dost slander her and torture me , never pray more . abandon all remorse ; on horror ’ s head horrors accumulate ; do deeds to make heaven weep , all earth amaz ’ d ; for nothing canst thou to damnation add greater than that .
shakespeare	othello	iago . o grace ! o heaven defend me ! are you a man ? have you a soul or sense ? god be wi ’ you . take mine office.—o wretched fool , that liv ’ st to make thine honesty a vice ! o monstrous world ! take note , take note , o world , to be direct and honest is not safe . i thank you for this profit , and from hence i ’ ll love no friend , sith love breeds such offence .
shakespeare	othello	othello . nay , stay . thou shouldst be honest . iago . i should be wise ; for honesty ’ s a fool , and loses that it works for . othello . by the world , i think my wife be honest , and think she is not . i think that thou art just , and think thou art not . i ’ ll have some proof : her name , that was as fresh as dian ’ s visage , is now begrim ’ d and black as mine own face . if there be cords or knives , poison or fire , or suffocating streams , i ’ ll not endure ’ t . would i were satisfied !

shakespeare	midsummer	hermia . so will i grow , so live , so die , my lord , ere i will yield my virgin patent up unto his lordship , whose unwishèd yoke my soul consents not to give sovereignty .
shakespeare	midsummer	theseus . take time to pause ; and by the next new moon the sealing-day betwixt my love and me for everlasting bond of fellowship , upon that day either prepare to die for disobedience to your father ’ s will , or else to wed demetrius , as he would , or on diana ’ s altar to protest for aye austerity and single life .

shakespeare	midsummer	hermia . belike for want of rain , which i could well beteem them from the tempest of my eyes . lysander . ay me ! for aught that i could ever read , could ever hear by tale or history , the course of true love never did run smooth . but either it was different in blood—
shakespeare	midsummer	hermia . o cross ! too high to be enthrall ’ d to low . lysander . or else misgraffèd in respect of years— hermia . o spite ! too old to be engag ’ d to young . lysander . or else it stood upon the choice of friends—
shakespeare	midsummer	hermia . o hell ! to choose love by another ’ s eyes ! lysander . or , if there were a sympathy in choice , war , death , or sickness did lay siege to it , making it momentany as a sound , swift as a shadow , short as any dream , brief as the lightning in the collied night that , in a spleen , unfolds both heaven and earth , and , ere a man hath power to say , ‘ behold ! ’ the jaws of darkness do devour it up : so quick bright things come to confusion .
shakespeare	midsummer	hermia . if then true lovers have ever cross ’ d , it stands as an edict in destiny . then let us teach our trial patience , because it is a customary cross , as due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs , wishes and tears , poor fancy ’ s followers .

shakespeare	midsummer	hermia . my good lysander ! i swear to thee by cupid ’ s strongest bow , by his best arrow with the golden head , by the simplicity of venus ’ doves , by that which knitteth souls and prospers loves , and by that fire which burn ’ d the carthage queen when the false trojan under sail was seen , by all the vows that ever men have broke ( in number more than ever women spoke ) , in that same place thou hast appointed me , tomorrow truly will i meet with thee .
shakespeare	midsummer	lysander . keep promise , love . look , here comes helena . enter helena . hermia . god speed fair helena ! whither away ? helena . call you me fair ? that fair again unsay . demetrius loves your fair . o happy fair ! your eyes are lode-stars and your tongue ’ s sweet air more tuneable than lark to shepherd ’ s ear , when wheat is green , when hawthorn buds appear . sickness is catching . o were favour so , yours would i catch , fair hermia , ere i go . my ear should catch your voice , my eye your eye , my tongue should catch your tongue ’ s sweet melody . were the world mine , demetrius being bated , the rest i ’ d give to be to you translated . o , teach me how you look , and with what art you sway the motion of demetrius ’ heart !

shakespeare	midsummer	helena . o that my prayers could such affection move ! hermia . the more i hate , the more he follows me . helena . the more i love , the more he hateth me . hermia . his folly , helena , is no fault of mine .
shakespeare	midsummer	helena . none but your beauty ; would that fault were mine ! hermia . take comfort : he no more shall see my face ; lysander and myself will fly this place . before the time i did lysander see , seem ’ d athens as a paradise to me . o , then , what graces in my love do dwell , that he hath turn ’ d a heaven into hell !
shakespeare	midsummer	lysander . helen , to you our minds we will unfold : tomorrow night , when phoebe doth behold her silver visage in the watery glass , decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass ( a time that lovers ’ flights doth still conceal ) , through athens ’ gates have we devis ’ d to steal .
shakespeare	midsummer	hermia . and in the wood where often you and i upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie , emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet , there my lysander and myself shall meet , and thence from athens turn away our eyes , to seek new friends and stranger companies . farewell , sweet playfellow . pray thou for us , and good luck grant thee thy demetrius ! keep word , lysander . we must starve our sight from lovers ’ food , till morrow deep midnight .
shakespeare	midsummer	lysander . i will , my hermia . [ _exit hermia._ ] helena , adieu . as you on him , demetrius dote on you ! [ _exit lysander._ ] helena . how happy some o ’ er other some can be ! through athens i am thought as fair as she . but what of that ? demetrius thinks not so ; he will not know what all but he do know . and as he errs , doting on hermia ’ s eyes , so i , admiring of his qualities . things base and vile , holding no quantity , love can transpose to form and dignity . love looks not with the eyes , but with the mind ; and therefore is wing ’ d cupid painted blind . nor hath love ’ s mind of any judgment taste . wings , and no eyes , figure unheedy haste . and therefore is love said to be a child , because in choice he is so oft beguil ’ d . as waggish boys in game themselves forswear , so the boy love is perjur ’ d everywhere . for , ere demetrius look ’ d on hermia ’ s eyne , he hail ’ d down oaths that he was only mine ; and when this hail some heat from hermia felt , so he dissolv ’ d , and showers of oaths did melt . i will go tell him of fair hermia ’ s flight . then to the wood will he tomorrow night pursue her ; and for this intelligence if i have thanks , it is a dear expense . but herein mean i to enrich my pain , to have his sight thither and back again .
shakespeare	midsummer	[ _exit helena._ ] scene ii . the same . a room in a cottage enter quince , snug , bottom , flute , snout and starveling . quince . is all our company here ? bottom . you were best to call them generally , man by man , according to the scrip .
shakespeare	midsummer	quince . here is the scroll of every man ’ s name , which is thought fit through all athens , to play in our interlude before the duke and duchess , on his wedding-day at night .
shakespeare	midsummer	bottom . first , good peter quince , say what the play treats on ; then read the names of the actors ; and so grow to a point . quince . marry , our play is _the most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of pyramus and thisbe_ .
shakespeare	midsummer	bottom . a very good piece of work , i assure you , and a merry . now , good peter quince , call forth your actors by the scroll . masters , spread yourselves . quince . answer , as i call you . nick bottom , the weaver .
shakespeare	midsummer	bottom . ready . name what part i am for , and proceed . quince . you , nick bottom , are set down for pyramus . bottom . what is pyramus—a lover , or a tyrant ? quince . a lover , that kills himself most gallantly for love .
shakespeare	midsummer	bottom . that will ask some tears in the true performing of it . if i do it , let the audience look to their eyes . i will move storms ; i will condole in some measure . to the rest—yet my chief humour is for a tyrant . i could play ercles rarely , or a part to tear a cat in , to make all split .
shakespeare	midsummer	the raging rocks and shivering shocks shall break the locks of prison gates , and phibbus ’ car shall shine from far , and make and mar the foolish fates . this was lofty . now name the rest of the players . this is ercles ’ vein , a tyrant ’ s vein ; a lover is more condoling .
shakespeare	midsummer	quince . francis flute , the bellows-mender . flute . here , peter quince . quince . flute , you must take thisbe on you . flute . what is thisbe ? a wandering knight ? quince . it is the lady that pyramus must love .
shakespeare	midsummer	flute . nay , faith , let not me play a woman . i have a beard coming . quince . that ’ s all one . you shall play it in a mask , and you may speak as small as you will .
shakespeare	midsummer	bottom . and i may hide my face , let me play thisbe too . i ’ ll speak in a monstrous little voice ; ‘ thisne , thisne ! ’ — ‘ ah , pyramus , my lover dear ! thy thisbe dear ! and lady dear ! ’
shakespeare	midsummer	quince . no , no , you must play pyramus ; and , flute , you thisbe . bottom . well , proceed . quince . robin starveling , the tailor . starveling . here , peter quince . quince . robin starveling , you must play thisbe ’ s mother . tom snout , the tinker .
shakespeare	midsummer	snout here , peter quince . quince . you , pyramus ’ father ; myself , thisbe ’ s father ; snug , the joiner , you , the lion ’ s part . and , i hope here is a play fitted . snug have you the lion ’ s part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study .
shakespeare	midsummer	quince . you may do it extempore , for it is nothing but roaring . bottom . let me play the lion too . i will roar that i will do any man ’ s heart good to hear me . i will roar that i will make the duke say ‘ let him roar again , let him roar again . ’
shakespeare	midsummer	quince . if you should do it too terribly , you would fright the duchess and the ladies , that they would shriek ; and that were enough to hang us all . all that would hang us every mother ’ s son .
shakespeare	midsummer	bottom . i grant you , friends , if you should fright the ladies out of their wits , they would have no more discretion but to hang us . but i will aggravate my voice so , that i will roar you as gently as any sucking dove ; i will roar you an ’ twere any nightingale .
shakespeare	midsummer	quince . you can play no part but pyramus , for pyramus is a sweet-faced man ; a proper man as one shall see in a summer ’ s day ; a most lovely gentleman-like man . therefore you must needs play pyramus .
shakespeare	midsummer	bottom . well , i will undertake it . what beard were i best to play it in ? quince . why , what you will . bottom . i will discharge it in either your straw-colour beard , your orange-tawny beard , your purple-in-grain beard , or your french-crown-colour beard , your perfect yellow .
shakespeare	midsummer	quince . some of your french crowns have no hair at all , and then you will play bare-faced . but , masters , here are your parts , and i am to entreat you , request you , and desire you , to con them by tomorrow night ; and meet me in the palace wood , a mile without the town , by moonlight ; there will we rehearse , for if we meet in the city , we shall be dogg ’ d with company , and our devices known . in the meantime i will draw a bill of properties , such as our play wants . i pray you fail me not .
shakespeare	midsummer	bottom . we will meet , and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously . take pains , be perfect ; adieu . quince . at the duke ’ s oak we meet . bottom . enough . hold , or cut bow-strings .
shakespeare	midsummer	[ _exeunt._ ] act ii scene i . a wood near athens enter a fairy at one door , and puck at another . puck . how now , spirit ! whither wander you ? fairy over hill , over dale , thorough bush , thorough brier , over park , over pale , thorough flood , thorough fire , i do wander everywhere , swifter than the moon ’ s sphere ; and i serve the fairy queen , to dew her orbs upon the green . the cowslips tall her pensioners be , in their gold coats spots you see ; those be rubies , fairy favours , in those freckles live their savours . i must go seek some dew-drops here , and hang a pearl in every cowslip ’ s ear . farewell , thou lob of spirits ; i ’ ll be gone . our queen and all her elves come here anon .
shakespeare	midsummer	puck . the king doth keep his revels here tonight ; take heed the queen come not within his sight , for oberon is passing fell and wrath , because that she , as her attendant , hath a lovely boy , stol ’ n from an indian king ; she never had so sweet a changeling . and jealous oberon would have the child knight of his train , to trace the forests wild : but she perforce withholds the lovèd boy , crowns him with flowers , and makes him all her joy . and now they never meet in grove or green , by fountain clear , or spangled starlight sheen , but they do square ; that all their elves for fear creep into acorn cups , and hide them there .
shakespeare	midsummer	fairy either i mistake your shape and making quite , or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite call ’ d robin goodfellow . are not you he that frights the maidens of the villagery , skim milk , and sometimes labour in the quern , and bootless make the breathless housewife churn , and sometime make the drink to bear no barm , mislead night-wanderers , laughing at their harm ? those that hobgoblin call you , and sweet puck , you do their work , and they shall have good luck . are not you he ?
shakespeare	midsummer	puck . thou speak ’ st aright ; i am that merry wanderer of the night . i jest to oberon , and make him smile , when i a fat and bean-fed horse beguile , neighing in likeness of a filly foal ; and sometime lurk i in a gossip ’ s bowl in very likeness of a roasted crab , and , when she drinks , against her lips i bob , and on her withered dewlap pour the ale . the wisest aunt , telling the saddest tale , sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me ; then slip i from her bum , down topples she , and ‘ tailor ’ cries , and falls into a cough ; and then the whole quire hold their hips and loffe and waxen in their mirth , and neeze , and swear a merrier hour was never wasted there . but room , fairy . here comes oberon .
shakespeare	midsummer	fairy and here my mistress . would that he were gone ! enter oberon at one door , with his train , and titania at another , with hers . oberon . ill met by moonlight , proud titania .
shakespeare	midsummer	titania . what , jealous oberon ! fairies , skip hence ; i have forsworn his bed and company . oberon . tarry , rash wanton ; am not i thy lord ? titania . then i must be thy lady ; but i know when thou hast stol ’ n away from fairyland , and in the shape of corin sat all day playing on pipes of corn , and versing love to amorous phillida . why art thou here , come from the farthest steep of india , but that , forsooth , the bouncing amazon , your buskin ’ d mistress and your warrior love , to theseus must be wedded ; and you come to give their bed joy and prosperity ?
shakespeare	midsummer	oberon . how canst thou thus , for shame , titania , glance at my credit with hippolyta , knowing i know thy love to theseus ? didst not thou lead him through the glimmering night from perigenia , whom he ravished ? and make him with fair aegles break his faith , with ariadne and antiopa ?
shakespeare	midsummer	titania . these are the forgeries of jealousy : and never , since the middle summer ’ s spring , met we on hill , in dale , forest , or mead , by pavèd fountain , or by rushy brook , or on the beachèd margent of the sea , to dance our ringlets to the whistling wind , but with thy brawls thou hast disturb ’ d our sport . therefore the winds , piping to us in vain , as in revenge , have suck ’ d up from the sea contagious fogs ; which , falling in the land , hath every pelting river made so proud that they have overborne their continents . the ox hath therefore stretch ’ d his yoke in vain , the ploughman lost his sweat , and the green corn hath rotted ere his youth attain ’ d a beard . the fold stands empty in the drownèd field , and crows are fatted with the murrion flock ; the nine-men ’ s-morris is fill ’ d up with mud , and the quaint mazes in the wanton green , for lack of tread , are undistinguishable . the human mortals want their winter here . no night is now with hymn or carol blest . therefore the moon , the governess of floods , pale in her anger , washes all the air , that rheumatic diseases do abound . and thorough this distemperature we see the seasons alter : hoary-headed frosts fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose ; and on old hiems ’ thin and icy crown an odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds is , as in mockery , set . the spring , the summer , the childing autumn , angry winter , change their wonted liveries ; and the mazed world , by their increase , now knows not which is which . and this same progeny of evils comes from our debate , from our dissension ; we are their parents and original .
shakespeare	midsummer	oberon . do you amend it , then . it lies in you . why should titania cross her oberon ? i do but beg a little changeling boy to be my henchman . titania . set your heart at rest ; the fairyland buys not the child of me . his mother was a vot ’ ress of my order , and in the spicèd indian air , by night , full often hath she gossip ’ d by my side ; and sat with me on neptune ’ s yellow sands , marking th ’ embarkèd traders on the flood , when we have laugh ’ d to see the sails conceive , and grow big-bellied with the wanton wind ; which she , with pretty and with swimming gait following ( her womb then rich with my young squire ) , would imitate , and sail upon the land , to fetch me trifles , and return again , as from a voyage , rich with merchandise . but she , being mortal , of that boy did die ; and for her sake do i rear up her boy , and for her sake i will not part with him .
shakespeare	midsummer	oberon . how long within this wood intend you stay ? titania . perchance till after theseus ’ wedding-day . if you will patiently dance in our round , and see our moonlight revels , go with us ; if not , shun me , and i will spare your haunts .
shakespeare	midsummer	oberon . give me that boy and i will go with thee . titania . not for thy fairy kingdom . fairies , away . we shall chide downright if i longer stay . [ _exit titania with her train._ ]
shakespeare	midsummer	oberon . well , go thy way . thou shalt not from this grove till i torment thee for this injury.— my gentle puck , come hither . thou rememb ’ rest since once i sat upon a promontory , and heard a mermaid on a dolphin ’ s back uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath that the rude sea grew civil at her song and certain stars shot madly from their spheres to hear the sea-maid ’ s music .
shakespeare	midsummer	puck . i remember . oberon . that very time i saw , ( but thou couldst not ) , flying between the cold moon and the earth , cupid all arm ’ d : a certain aim he took at a fair vestal , thronèd by the west , and loos ’ d his love-shaft smartly from his bow as it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts . but i might see young cupid ’ s fiery shaft quench ’ d in the chaste beams of the watery moon ; and the imperial votress passed on , in maiden meditation , fancy-free . yet mark ’ d i where the bolt of cupid fell : it fell upon a little western flower , before milk-white , now purple with love ’ s wound , and maidens call it love-in-idleness . fetch me that flower , the herb i showed thee once : the juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid will make or man or woman madly dote upon the next live creature that it sees . fetch me this herb , and be thou here again ere the leviathan can swim a league .
shakespeare	midsummer	puck . i ’ ll put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes . [ _exit puck._ ] oberon . having once this juice , i ’ ll watch titania when she is asleep , and drop the liquor of it in her eyes : the next thing then she waking looks upon ( be it on lion , bear , or wolf , or bull , on meddling monkey , or on busy ape ) she shall pursue it with the soul of love . and ere i take this charm from off her sight ( as i can take it with another herb ) i ’ ll make her render up her page to me . but who comes here ? i am invisible ; and i will overhear their conference .
shakespeare	midsummer	enter demetrius , helena following him . demetrius . i love thee not , therefore pursue me not . where is lysander and fair hermia ? the one i ’ ll slay , the other slayeth me . thou told ’ st me they were stol ’ n into this wood , and here am i , and wode within this wood because i can not meet with hermia . hence , get thee gone , and follow me no more .
shakespeare	midsummer	helena . you draw me , you hard-hearted adamant , but yet you draw not iron , for my heart is true as steel . leave you your power to draw , and i shall have no power to follow you .
shakespeare	midsummer	demetrius . do i entice you ? do i speak you fair ? or rather do i not in plainest truth tell you i do not , nor i can not love you ? helena . and even for that do i love you the more . i am your spaniel ; and , demetrius , the more you beat me , i will fawn on you . use me but as your spaniel , spurn me , strike me , neglect me , lose me ; only give me leave , unworthy as i am , to follow you . what worser place can i beg in your love , ( and yet a place of high respect with me ) than to be usèd as you use your dog ?
shakespeare	midsummer	demetrius . tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit ; for i am sick when i do look on thee . helena . and i am sick when i look not on you .
shakespeare	midsummer	demetrius . you do impeach your modesty too much to leave the city and commit yourself into the hands of one that loves you not , to trust the opportunity of night . and the ill counsel of a desert place , with the rich worth of your virginity .
shakespeare	midsummer	helena . your virtue is my privilege : for that . it is not night when i do see your face , therefore i think i am not in the night ; nor doth this wood lack worlds of company , for you , in my respect , are all the world . then how can it be said i am alone when all the world is here to look on me ?
shakespeare	midsummer	demetrius . i ’ ll run from thee and hide me in the brakes , and leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts . helena . the wildest hath not such a heart as you . run when you will , the story shall be chang ’ d ; apollo flies , and daphne holds the chase ; the dove pursues the griffin , the mild hind makes speed to catch the tiger . bootless speed , when cowardice pursues and valour flies !
shakespeare	midsummer	demetrius . i will not stay thy questions . let me go , or if thou follow me , do not believe but i shall do thee mischief in the wood . helena . ay , in the temple , in the town , the field , you do me mischief . fie , demetrius ! your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex . we can not fight for love as men may do . we should be woo ’ d , and were not made to woo .
shakespeare	midsummer	[ _exit demetrius._ ] i ’ ll follow thee , and make a heaven of hell , to die upon the hand i love so well . [ _exit helena._ ] oberon . fare thee well , nymph . ere he do leave this grove , thou shalt fly him , and he shall seek thy love .
shakespeare	midsummer	enter puck . hast thou the flower there ? welcome , wanderer . puck . ay , there it is . oberon . i pray thee give it me . i know a bank where the wild thyme blows , where oxlips and the nodding violet grows , quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine , with sweet musk-roses , and with eglantine . there sleeps titania sometime of the night , lull ’ d in these flowers with dances and delight ; and there the snake throws her enamell ’ d skin , weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in . and with the juice of this i ’ ll streak her eyes , and make her full of hateful fantasies . take thou some of it , and seek through this grove : a sweet athenian lady is in love with a disdainful youth . anoint his eyes ; but do it when the next thing he espies may be the lady . thou shalt know the man by the athenian garments he hath on . effect it with some care , that he may prove more fond on her than she upon her love : and look thou meet me ere the first cock crow .
shakespeare	midsummer	puck . fear not , my lord , your servant shall do so . [ _exeunt._ ] scene ii . another part of the wood enter titania with her train . titania . come , now a roundel and a fairy song ; then for the third part of a minute , hence ; some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds ; some war with reremice for their leathern wings , to make my small elves coats ; and some keep back the clamorous owl , that nightly hoots and wonders at our quaint spirits . sing me now asleep ; then to your offices , and let me rest .
shakespeare	midsummer	fairies sing . first fairy . you spotted snakes with double tongue , thorny hedgehogs , be not seen ; newts and blind-worms do no wrong , come not near our fairy queen : chorus . philomel , with melody , sing in our sweet lullaby : lulla , lulla , lullaby ; lulla , lulla , lullaby . never harm , nor spell , nor charm , come our lovely lady nigh ; so good night , with lullaby .
shakespeare	midsummer	first fairy . weaving spiders , come not here ; hence , you long-legg ’ d spinners , hence . beetles black , approach not near ; worm nor snail do no offence . chorus . philomel with melody , & c. second fairy . hence away ! now all is well . one aloof stand sentinel .
shakespeare	midsummer	[ _exeunt fairies . titania sleeps._ ] enter oberon . oberon . what thou seest when thou dost wake , [ _squeezes the flower on titania ’ s eyelids._ ] do it for thy true love take ; love and languish for his sake . be it ounce , or cat , or bear , pard , or boar with bristled hair , in thy eye that shall appear when thou wak ’ st , it is thy dear . wake when some vile thing is near .
shakespeare	midsummer	[ _exit._ ] enter lysander and hermia . lysander . fair love , you faint with wand ’ ring in the wood . and , to speak troth , i have forgot our way . we ’ ll rest us , hermia , if you think it good , and tarry for the comfort of the day .
shakespeare	midsummer	hermia . be it so , lysander : find you out a bed , for i upon this bank will rest my head . lysander . one turf shall serve as pillow for us both ; one heart , one bed , two bosoms , and one troth .
shakespeare	midsummer	hermia . nay , good lysander ; for my sake , my dear , lie further off yet , do not lie so near . lysander . o take the sense , sweet , of my innocence ! love takes the meaning in love ’ s conference . i mean that my heart unto yours is knit , so that but one heart we can make of it : two bosoms interchainèd with an oath , so then two bosoms and a single troth . then by your side no bed-room me deny ; for lying so , hermia , i do not lie .
shakespeare	midsummer	hermia . lysander riddles very prettily . now much beshrew my manners and my pride , if hermia meant to say lysander lied ! but , gentle friend , for love and courtesy lie further off , in human modesty , such separation as may well be said becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid , so far be distant ; and good night , sweet friend : thy love ne ’ er alter till thy sweet life end !
shakespeare	midsummer	lysander . amen , amen , to that fair prayer say i ; and then end life when i end loyalty ! here is my bed . sleep give thee all his rest ! hermia . with half that wish the wisher ’ s eyes be pressed !
shakespeare	midsummer	[ _they sleep._ ] enter puck . puck . through the forest have i gone , but athenian found i none , on whose eyes i might approve this flower ’ s force in stirring love . night and silence ! who is here ? weeds of athens he doth wear : this is he , my master said , despisèd the athenian maid ; and here the maiden , sleeping sound , on the dank and dirty ground . pretty soul , she durst not lie near this lack-love , this kill-courtesy . churl , upon thy eyes i throw all the power this charm doth owe ; when thou wak ’ st let love forbid sleep his seat on thy eyelid . so awake when i am gone ; for i must now to oberon .
shakespeare	midsummer	[ _exit._ ] enter demetrius and helena , running . helena . stay , though thou kill me , sweet demetrius . demetrius . i charge thee , hence , and do not haunt me thus . helena . o , wilt thou darkling leave me ? do not so .
shakespeare	midsummer	demetrius . stay , on thy peril ; i alone will go . [ _exit demetrius._ ] helena . o , i am out of breath in this fond chase ! the more my prayer , the lesser is my grace . happy is hermia , wheresoe ’ er she lies , for she hath blessèd and attractive eyes . how came her eyes so bright ? not with salt tears . if so , my eyes are oftener wash ’ d than hers . no , no , i am as ugly as a bear , for beasts that meet me run away for fear : therefore no marvel though demetrius do , as a monster , fly my presence thus . what wicked and dissembling glass of mine made me compare with hermia ’ s sphery eyne ? but who is here ? lysander , on the ground ! dead or asleep ? i see no blood , no wound . lysander , if you live , good sir , awake .
shakespeare	midsummer	lysander . [ _waking._ ] and run through fire i will for thy sweet sake . transparent helena ! nature shows art , that through thy bosom makes me see thy heart . where is demetrius ? o , how fit a word is that vile name to perish on my sword !
shakespeare	midsummer	helena . do not say so , lysander , say not so . what though he love your hermia ? lord , what though ? yet hermia still loves you . then be content . lysander . content with hermia ? no , i do repent the tedious minutes i with her have spent . not hermia , but helena i love . who will not change a raven for a dove ? the will of man is by his reason sway ’ d , and reason says you are the worthier maid . things growing are not ripe until their season ; so i , being young , till now ripe not to reason ; and touching now the point of human skill , reason becomes the marshal to my will , and leads me to your eyes , where i o ’ erlook love ’ s stories , written in love ’ s richest book .
shakespeare	midsummer	helena . wherefore was i to this keen mockery born ? when at your hands did i deserve this scorn ? is ’ t not enough , is ’ t not enough , young man , that i did never , no , nor never can deserve a sweet look from demetrius ’ eye , but you must flout my insufficiency ? good troth , you do me wrong , good sooth , you do , in such disdainful manner me to woo . but fare you well ; perforce i must confess , i thought you lord of more true gentleness . o , that a lady of one man refus ’ d , should of another therefore be abus ’ d !
shakespeare	midsummer	[ _exit._ ] lysander . she sees not hermia . hermia , sleep thou there , and never mayst thou come lysander near ! for , as a surfeit of the sweetest things the deepest loathing to the stomach brings ; or as the heresies that men do leave are hated most of those they did deceive ; so thou , my surfeit and my heresy , of all be hated , but the most of me ! and , all my powers , address your love and might to honour helen , and to be her knight !
shakespeare	midsummer	[ _exit._ ] hermia . [ _starting._ ] help me , lysander , help me ! do thy best to pluck this crawling serpent from my breast ! ay me , for pity ! what a dream was here ! lysander , look how i do quake with fear . methought a serpent eat my heart away , and you sat smiling at his cruel prey . lysander ! what , removed ? lysander ! lord ! what , out of hearing ? gone ? no sound , no word ? alack , where are you ? speak , and if you hear ; speak , of all loves ! i swoon almost with fear . no ? then i well perceive you are not nigh . either death or you i ’ ll find immediately .
shakespeare	midsummer	[ _exit._ ] act iii scene i . the wood . the queen of fairies still lying asleep . enter bottom , quince , snout , starveling , snug and flute . bottom . are we all met ? quince . pat , pat ; and here ’ s a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal . this green plot shall be our stage , this hawthorn brake our tiring-house ; and we will do it in action , as we will do it before the duke .
shakespeare	midsummer	bottom . peter quince ? quince . what sayest thou , bully bottom ? bottom . there are things in this comedy of pyramus and thisbe that will never please . first , pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself ; which the ladies can not abide . how answer you that ?
shakespeare	midsummer	snout by ’ r lakin , a parlous fear . starveling . i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . bottom . not a whit ; i have a device to make all well . write me a prologue , and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords , and that pyramus is not killed indeed ; and for the more better assurance , tell them that i pyramus am not pyramus but bottom the weaver . this will put them out of fear .
shakespeare	midsummer	quince . well , we will have such a prologue ; and it shall be written in eight and six . bottom . no , make it two more ; let it be written in eight and eight .
shakespeare	midsummer	snout will not the ladies be afeard of the lion ? starveling . i fear it , i promise you . bottom . masters , you ought to consider with yourselves , to bring in ( god shield us ! ) a lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing . for there is not a more fearful wild-fowl than your lion living ; and we ought to look to it .
shakespeare	midsummer	snout therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion . bottom . nay , you must name his name , and half his face must be seen through the lion ’ s neck ; and he himself must speak through , saying thus , or to the same defect : ‘ ladies , ’ or , ‘ fair ladies , i would wish you , ’ or , ‘ i would request you , ’ or , ’ i would entreat you , not to fear , not to tremble : my life for yours . if you think i come hither as a lion , it were pity of my life . no , i am no such thing ; i am a man as other men are ’ : and there , indeed , let him name his name , and tell them plainly he is snug the joiner .
shakespeare	midsummer	quince . well , it shall be so . but there is two hard things : that is , to bring the moonlight into a chamber , for you know , pyramus and thisbe meet by moonlight .
shakespeare	midsummer	snout doth the moon shine that night we play our play ? bottom . a calendar , a calendar ! look in the almanack ; find out moonshine , find out moonshine . quince . yes , it doth shine that night .
shakespeare	midsummer	bottom . why , then may you leave a casement of the great chamber window , where we play , open ; and the moon may shine in at the casement . quince . ay ; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern , and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person of moonshine . then there is another thing : we must have a wall in the great chamber ; for pyramus and thisbe , says the story , did talk through the chink of a wall .
shakespeare	midsummer	snout you can never bring in a wall . what say you , bottom ? bottom . some man or other must present wall . and let him have some plaster , or some loam , or some rough-cast about him , to signify wall ; and let him hold his fingers thus , and through that cranny shall pyramus and thisbe whisper .
shakespeare	midsummer	quince . if that may be , then all is well . come , sit down , every mother ’ s son , and rehearse your parts . pyramus , you begin : when you have spoken your speech , enter into that brake ; and so everyone according to his cue .
shakespeare	midsummer	enter puck behind . puck . what hempen homespuns have we swaggering here , so near the cradle of the fairy queen ? what , a play toward ? i ’ ll be an auditor ; an actor too perhaps , if i see cause .
shakespeare	midsummer	quince . speak , pyramus.—thisbe , stand forth . pyramus . _thisbe , the flowers of odious savours sweet_ quince . odours , odours . pyramus . _. . . odours savours sweet . so hath thy breath , my dearest thisbe dear . but hark , a voice ! stay thou but here awhile , and by and by i will to thee appear._
shakespeare	midsummer	[ _exit._ ] puck . a stranger pyramus than e ’ er played here ! [ _exit._ ] thisbe . must i speak now ? quince . ay , marry , must you , for you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard , and is to come again .
shakespeare	midsummer	thisbe . _most radiant pyramus , most lily-white of hue , of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier , most brisky juvenal , and eke most lovely jew , as true as truest horse , that yet would never tire , i ’ ll meet thee , pyramus , at ninny ’ s tomb._
shakespeare	midsummer	quince . ninus ’ tomb , man ! why , you must not speak that yet . that you answer to pyramus . you speak all your part at once , cues , and all.—pyramus enter ! your cue is past ; it is ‘ never tire . ’
shakespeare	midsummer	thisbe . o , _as true as truest horse , that yet would never tire._ enter puck and bottom with an ass ’ s head . pyramus . _if i were fair , thisbe , i were only thine._
shakespeare	midsummer	quince . o monstrous ! o strange ! we are haunted . pray , masters , fly , masters ! help ! [ _exeunt clowns._ ] puck . i ’ ll follow you . i ’ ll lead you about a round , through bog , through bush , through brake , through brier ; sometime a horse i ’ ll be , sometime a hound , a hog , a headless bear , sometime a fire ; and neigh , and bark , and grunt , and roar , and burn , like horse , hound , hog , bear , fire , at every turn .
shakespeare	midsummer	[ _exit._ ] bottom . why do they run away ? this is a knavery of them to make me afeard . enter snout . snout o bottom , thou art changed ! what do i see on thee ?
shakespeare	midsummer	bottom . what do you see ? you see an ass-head of your own , do you ? [ _exit snout._ ] enter quince . quince . bless thee , bottom ! bless thee ! thou art translated . [ _exit._ ] bottom . i see their knavery . this is to make an ass of me , to fright me , if they could . but i will not stir from this place , do what they can . i will walk up and down here , and i will sing , that they shall hear i am not afraid . [ _sings._ ] the ousel cock , so black of hue , with orange-tawny bill , the throstle with his note so true , the wren with little quill .
shakespeare	midsummer	titania . [ _waking._ ] what angel wakes me from my flowery bed ? bottom . [ _sings._ ] the finch , the sparrow , and the lark , the plain-song cuckoo gray , whose note full many a man doth mark , and dares not answer nay . for , indeed , who would set his wit to so foolish a bird ? who would give a bird the lie , though he cry ‘ cuckoo ’ never so ?
shakespeare	midsummer	titania . i pray thee , gentle mortal , sing again . mine ear is much enamour ’ d of thy note . so is mine eye enthrallèd to thy shape ; and thy fair virtue ’ s force perforce doth move me , on the first view , to say , to swear , i love thee .
shakespeare	midsummer	bottom . methinks , mistress , you should have little reason for that . and yet , to say the truth , reason and love keep little company together nowadays . the more the pity that some honest neighbours will not make them friends . nay , i can gleek upon occasion .
shakespeare	midsummer	titania . thou art as wise as thou art beautiful . bottom . not so , neither ; but if i had wit enough to get out of this wood , i have enough to serve mine own turn .
shakespeare	midsummer	titania . out of this wood do not desire to go . thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no . i am a spirit of no common rate . the summer still doth tend upon my state ; and i do love thee : therefore , go with me . i ’ ll give thee fairies to attend on thee ; and they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep , and sing , while thou on pressèd flowers dost sleep . and i will purge thy mortal grossness so that thou shalt like an airy spirit go.— peaseblossom ! cobweb ! moth ! and mustardseed !
shakespeare	midsummer	enter four fairies . peaseblossom . ready . cobweb . and i. moth . and i. mustardseed . and i . all . where shall we go ? titania . be kind and courteous to this gentleman ; hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes ; feed him with apricocks and dewberries , with purple grapes , green figs , and mulberries ; the honey-bags steal from the humble-bees , and for night-tapers , crop their waxen thighs , and light them at the fiery glow-worm ’ s eyes , to have my love to bed and to arise ; and pluck the wings from painted butterflies , to fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes . nod to him , elves , and do him courtesies .
shakespeare	midsummer	peaseblossom . hail , mortal ! cobweb . hail ! moth . hail ! mustardseed . hail ! bottom . i cry your worships mercy , heartily.—i beseech your worship ’ s name . cobweb . cobweb . bottom . i shall desire you of more acquaintance , good master cobweb . if i cut my finger , i shall make bold with you.—your name , honest gentleman ?
shakespeare	midsummer	peaseblossom . peaseblossom . bottom . i pray you , commend me to mistress squash , your mother , and to master peascod , your father . good master peaseblossom , i shall desire you of more acquaintance too.—your name , i beseech you , sir ?
shakespeare	midsummer	mustardseed . mustardseed . bottom . good master mustardseed , i know your patience well . that same cowardly giant-like ox-beef hath devoured many a gentleman of your house . i promise you , your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now . i desire you of more acquaintance , good master mustardseed .
shakespeare	midsummer	titania . come , wait upon him ; lead him to my bower . the moon , methinks , looks with a watery eye , and when she weeps , weeps every little flower , lamenting some enforced chastity . tie up my love ’ s tongue , bring him silently .
shakespeare	midsummer	[ _exeunt._ ] scene ii . another part of the wood enter oberon . oberon . i wonder if titania be awak ’ d ; then , what it was that next came in her eye , which she must dote on in extremity .
shakespeare	midsummer	enter puck . here comes my messenger . how now , mad spirit ? what night-rule now about this haunted grove ? puck . my mistress with a monster is in love . near to her close and consecrated bower , while she was in her dull and sleeping hour , a crew of patches , rude mechanicals , that work for bread upon athenian stalls , were met together to rehearse a play intended for great theseus ’ nuptial day . the shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort who pyramus presented in their sport , forsook his scene and enter ’ d in a brake . when i did him at this advantage take , an ass ’ s nole i fixed on his head . anon , his thisbe must be answerèd , and forth my mimic comes . when they him spy , as wild geese that the creeping fowler eye , or russet-pated choughs , many in sort , rising and cawing at the gun ’ s report , sever themselves and madly sweep the sky , so at his sight away his fellows fly , and at our stamp , here o ’ er and o ’ er one falls ; he murder cries , and help from athens calls . their sense thus weak , lost with their fears , thus strong , made senseless things begin to do them wrong ; for briers and thorns at their apparel snatch ; some sleeves , some hats , from yielders all things catch . i led them on in this distracted fear , and left sweet pyramus translated there . when in that moment , so it came to pass , titania wak ’ d , and straightway lov ’ d an ass .
shakespeare	midsummer	oberon . this falls out better than i could devise . but hast thou yet latch ’ d the athenian ’ s eyes with the love-juice , as i did bid thee do ? puck . i took him sleeping—that is finish ’ d too— and the athenian woman by his side , that , when he wak ’ d , of force she must be ey ’ d .
shakespeare	midsummer	enter demetrius and hermia . oberon . stand close . this is the same athenian . puck . this is the woman , but not this the man . demetrius . o why rebuke you him that loves you so ? lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe .
shakespeare	midsummer	hermia . now i but chide , but i should use thee worse , for thou , i fear , hast given me cause to curse . if thou hast slain lysander in his sleep , being o ’ er shoes in blood , plunge in the deep , and kill me too . the sun was not so true unto the day as he to me . would he have stol ’ n away from sleeping hermia ? i ’ ll believe as soon this whole earth may be bor ’ d , and that the moon may through the centre creep and so displease her brother ’ s noontide with th ’ antipodes . it can not be but thou hast murder ’ d him . so should a murderer look , so dead , so grim .
shakespeare	midsummer	demetrius . so should the murder ’ d look , and so should i , pierc ’ d through the heart with your stern cruelty . yet you , the murderer , look as bright , as clear , as yonder venus in her glimmering sphere .
shakespeare	midsummer	hermia . what ’ s this to my lysander ? where is he ? ah , good demetrius , wilt thou give him me ? demetrius . i had rather give his carcass to my hounds . hermia . out , dog ! out , cur ! thou driv ’ st me past the bounds of maiden ’ s patience . hast thou slain him , then ? henceforth be never number ’ d among men ! o once tell true ; tell true , even for my sake ! durst thou have look ’ d upon him , being awake , and hast thou kill ’ d him sleeping ? o brave touch ! could not a worm , an adder , do so much ? an adder did it ; for with doubler tongue than thine , thou serpent , never adder stung .
shakespeare	midsummer	demetrius . you spend your passion on a mispris ’ d mood : i am not guilty of lysander ’ s blood ; nor is he dead , for aught that i can tell . hermia . i pray thee , tell me then that he is well .
shakespeare	midsummer	demetrius . and if i could , what should i get therefore ? hermia . a privilege never to see me more . and from thy hated presence part i so : see me no more , whether he be dead or no .
shakespeare	midsummer	[ _exit._ ] demetrius . there is no following her in this fierce vein . here , therefore , for a while i will remain . so sorrow ’ s heaviness doth heavier grow for debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe ; which now in some slight measure it will pay , if for his tender here i make some stay .
shakespeare	midsummer	[ _lies down._ ] oberon . what hast thou done ? thou hast mistaken quite , and laid the love-juice on some true-love ’ s sight . of thy misprision must perforce ensue some true love turn ’ d , and not a false turn ’ d true .
