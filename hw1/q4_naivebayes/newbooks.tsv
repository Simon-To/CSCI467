austen	persuasion	chapter i . sir walter elliot , of kellynch hall , in somersetshire , was a man who , for his own amusement , never took up any book but the baronetage ; there he found occupation for an idle hour , and consolation in a distressed one ; there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect , by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents ; there any unwelcome sensations , arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century ; and there , if every other leaf were powerless , he could read his own history with an interest which never failed . this was the page at which the favourite volume always opened :
austen	persuasion	“ elliot of kellynch hall . “ walter elliot , born march 1 , 1760 , married , july 15 , 1784 , elizabeth , daughter of james stevenson , esq . of south park , in the county of gloucester , by which lady ( who died 1800 ) he has issue elizabeth , born june 1 , 1785 ; anne , born august 9 , 1787 ; a still-born son , november 5 , 1789 ; mary , born november 20 , 1791 . ”
austen	persuasion	precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer ’ s hands ; but sir walter had improved it by adding , for the information of himself and his family , these words , after the date of mary ’ s birth— “ married , december 16 , 1810 , charles , son and heir of charles musgrove , esq . of uppercross , in the county of somerset , ” and by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which he had lost his wife .
austen	persuasion	then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family , in the usual terms ; how it had been first settled in cheshire ; how mentioned in dugdale , serving the office of high sheriff , representing a borough in three successive parliaments , exertions of loyalty , and dignity of baronet , in the first year of charles ii , with all the marys and elizabeths they had married ; forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages , and concluding with the arms and motto : — “ principal seat , kellynch hall , in the county of somerset , ” and sir walter ’ s handwriting again in this finale : —
austen	persuasion	“ heir presumptive , william walter elliot , esq. , great grandson of the second sir walter. ” vanity was the beginning and the end of sir walter elliot ’ s character ; vanity of person and of situation . he had been remarkably handsome in his youth ; and , at fifty-four , was still a very fine man . few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did , nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in society . he considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy ; and the sir walter elliot , who united these gifts , was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion .
austen	persuasion	his good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment ; since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to any thing deserved by his own . lady elliot had been an excellent woman , sensible and amiable ; whose judgement and conduct , if they might be pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her lady elliot , had never required indulgence afterwards.—she had humoured , or softened , or concealed his failings , and promoted his real respectability for seventeen years ; and though not the very happiest being in the world herself , had found enough in her duties , her friends , and her children , to attach her to life , and make it no matter of indifference to her when she was called on to quit them.—three girls , the two eldest sixteen and fourteen , was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath , an awful charge rather , to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceited , silly father . she had , however , one very intimate friend , a sensible , deserving woman , who had been brought , by strong attachment to herself , to settle close by her , in the village of kellynch ; and on her kindness and advice , lady elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously giving her daughters .
austen	persuasion	this friend , and sir walter , did not marry , whatever might have been anticipated on that head by their acquaintance . thirteen years had passed away since lady elliot ’ s death , and they were still near neighbours and intimate friends , and one remained a widower , the other a widow .
austen	persuasion	that lady russell , of steady age and character , and extremely well provided for , should have no thought of a second marriage , needs no apology to the public , which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman _does_ marry again , than when she does _not ; _ but sir walter ’ s continuing in singleness requires explanation . be it known then , that sir walter , like a good father , ( having met with one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications ) , prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters ’ sake . for one daughter , his eldest , he would really have given up any thing , which he had not been very much tempted to do . elizabeth had succeeded , at sixteen , to all that was possible , of her mother ’ s rights and consequence ; and being very handsome , and very like himself , her influence had always been great , and they had gone on together most happily . his two other children were of very inferior value . mary had acquired a little artificial importance , by becoming mrs charles musgrove ; but anne , with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character , which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding , was nobody with either father or sister ; her word had no weight , her convenience was always to give way—she was only anne .
austen	persuasion	to lady russell , indeed , she was a most dear and highly valued god-daughter , favourite , and friend . lady russell loved them all ; but it was only in anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again .
austen	persuasion	a few years before , anne elliot had been a very pretty girl , but her bloom had vanished early ; and as even in its height , her father had found little to admire in her , ( so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own ) , there could be nothing in them , now that she was faded and thin , to excite his esteem . he had never indulged much hope , he had now none , of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work . all equality of alliance must rest with elizabeth , for mary had merely connected herself with an old country family of respectability and large fortune , and had therefore _given_ all the honour and received none : elizabeth would , one day or other , marry suitably .
austen	persuasion	it sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine than she was ten years before ; and , generally speaking , if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety , it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost . it was so with elizabeth , still the same handsome miss elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago , and sir walter might be excused , therefore , in forgetting her age , or , at least , be deemed only half a fool , for thinking himself and elizabeth as blooming as ever , amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else ; for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing . anne haggard , mary coarse , every face in the neighbourhood worsting , and the rapid increase of the crow ’ s foot about lady russell ’ s temples had long been a distress to him .
austen	persuasion	elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment . thirteen years had seen her mistress of kellynch hall , presiding and directing with a self-possession and decision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than she was . for thirteen years had she been doing the honours , and laying down the domestic law at home , and leading the way to the chaise and four , and walking immediately after lady russell out of all the drawing-rooms and dining-rooms in the country . thirteen winters ’ revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded , and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms , as she travelled up to london with her father , for a few weeks ’ annual enjoyment of the great world . she had the remembrance of all this , she had the consciousness of being nine-and-twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions ; she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever , but she felt her approach to the years of danger , and would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet-blood within the next twelvemonth or two . then might she again take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth , but now she liked it not . always to be presented with the date of her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister , made the book an evil ; and more than once , when her father had left it open on the table near her , had she closed it , with averted eyes , and pushed it away .
austen	persuasion	she had had a disappointment , moreover , which that book , and especially the history of her own family , must ever present the remembrance of . the heir presumptive , the very william walter elliot , esq. , whose rights had been so generously supported by her father , had disappointed her .
austen	persuasion	she had , while a very young girl , as soon as she had known him to be , in the event of her having no brother , the future baronet , meant to marry him , and her father had always meant that she should . he had not been known to them as a boy ; but soon after lady elliot ’ s death , sir walter had sought the acquaintance , and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth , he had persevered in seeking it , making allowance for the modest drawing-back of youth ; and , in one of their spring excursions to london , when elizabeth was in her first bloom , mr elliot had been forced into the introduction .
austen	persuasion	he was at that time a very young man , just engaged in the study of the law ; and elizabeth found him extremely agreeable , and every plan in his favour was confirmed . he was invited to kellynch hall ; he was talked of and expected all the rest of the year ; but he never came . the following spring he was seen again in town , found equally agreeable , again encouraged , invited , and expected , and again he did not come ; and the next tidings were that he was married . instead of pushing his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of elliot , he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of inferior birth .
austen	persuasion	sir walter had resented it . as the head of the house , he felt that he ought to have been consulted , especially after taking the young man so publicly by the hand ; “ for they must have been seen together , ” he observed , “ once at tattersall ’ s , and twice in the lobby of the house of commons. ” his disapprobation was expressed , but apparently very little regarded . mr elliot had attempted no apology , and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family , as sir walter considered him unworthy of it : all acquaintance between them had ceased .
austen	persuasion	this very awkward history of mr elliot was still , after an interval of several years , felt with anger by elizabeth , who had liked the man for himself , and still more for being her father ’ s heir , and whose strong family pride could see only in _him_ a proper match for sir walter elliot ’ s eldest daughter . there was not a baronet from a to z whom her feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal . yet so miserably had he conducted himself , that though she was at this present time ( the summer of 1814 ) wearing black ribbons for his wife , she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again . the disgrace of his first marriage might , perhaps , as there was no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring , have been got over , had he not done worse ; but he had , as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends , they had been informed , spoken most disrespectfully of them all , most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to , and the honours which were hereafter to be his own . this could not be pardoned .
austen	persuasion	such were elizabeth elliot ’ s sentiments and sensations ; such the cares to alloy , the agitations to vary , the sameness and the elegance , the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life ; such the feelings to give interest to a long , uneventful residence in one country circle , to fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad , no talents or accomplishments for home , to occupy .
austen	persuasion	but now , another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be added to these . her father was growing distressed for money . she knew , that when he now took up the baronetage , it was to drive the heavy bills of his tradespeople , and the unwelcome hints of mr shepherd , his agent , from his thoughts . the kellynch property was good , but not equal to sir walter ’ s apprehension of the state required in its possessor . while lady elliot lived , there had been method , moderation , and economy , which had just kept him within his income ; but with her had died all such right-mindedness , and from that period he had been constantly exceeding it . it had not been possible for him to spend less ; he had done nothing but what sir walter elliot was imperiously called on to do ; but blameless as he was , he was not only growing dreadfully in debt , but was hearing of it so often , that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer , even partially , from his daughter . he had given her some hints of it the last spring in town ; he had gone so far even as to say , “ can we retrench ? does it occur to you that there is any one article in which we can retrench ? ” and elizabeth , to do her justice , had , in the first ardour of female alarm , set seriously to think what could be done , and had finally proposed these two branches of economy , to cut off some unnecessary charities , and to refrain from new furnishing the drawing-room ; to which expedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no present down to anne , as had been the usual yearly custom . but these measures , however good in themselves , were insufficient for the real extent of the evil , the whole of which sir walter found himself obliged to confess to her soon afterwards . elizabeth had nothing to propose of deeper efficacy . she felt herself ill-used and unfortunate , as did her father ; and they were neither of them able to devise any means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity , or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne .
austen	persuasion	there was only a small part of his estate that sir walter could dispose of ; but had every acre been alienable , it would have made no difference . he had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power , but he would never condescend to sell . no ; he would never disgrace his name so far . the kellynch estate should be transmitted whole and entire , as he had received it .
austen	persuasion	their two confidential friends , mr shepherd , who lived in the neighbouring market town , and lady russell , were called to advise them ; and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and reduce their expenditure , without involving the loss of any indulgence of taste or pride .
austen	persuasion	chapter ii . mr shepherd , a civil , cautious lawyer , who , whatever might be his hold or his views on sir walter , would rather have the _disagreeable_ prompted by anybody else , excused himself from offering the slightest hint , and only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent judgement of lady russell , from whose known good sense he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as he meant to see finally adopted .
austen	persuasion	lady russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject , and gave it much serious consideration . she was a woman rather of sound than of quick abilities , whose difficulties in coming to any decision in this instance were great , from the opposition of two leading principles . she was of strict integrity herself , with a delicate sense of honour ; but she was as desirous of saving sir walter ’ s feelings , as solicitous for the credit of the family , as aristocratic in her ideas of what was due to them , as anybody of sense and honesty could well be . she was a benevolent , charitable , good woman , and capable of strong attachments , most correct in her conduct , strict in her notions of decorum , and with manners that were held a standard of good-breeding . she had a cultivated mind , and was , generally speaking , rational and consistent—but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry ; she had a value for rank and consequence , which blinded her a little to the faults of those who possessed them . herself the widow of only a knight , she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due ; and sir walter , independent of his claims as an old acquaintance , an attentive neighbour , an obliging landlord , the husband of her very dear friend , the father of anne and her sisters , was , as being sir walter , in her apprehension , entitled to a great deal of compassion and consideration under his present difficulties .
austen	persuasion	they must retrench ; that did not admit of a doubt . but she was very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and elizabeth . she drew up plans of economy , she made exact calculations , and she did what nobody else thought of doing : she consulted anne , who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the question . she consulted , and in a degree was influenced by her in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to sir walter . every emendation of anne ’ s had been on the side of honesty against importance . she wanted more vigorous measures , a more complete reformation , a quicker release from debt , a much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity .
austen	persuasion	“ if we can persuade your father to all this , ” said lady russell , looking over her paper , “ much may be done . if he will adopt these regulations , in seven years he will be clear ; and i hope we may be able to convince him and elizabeth , that kellynch hall has a respectability in itself which can not be affected by these reductions ; and that the true dignity of sir walter elliot will be very far from lessened in the eyes of sensible people , by acting like a man of principle . what will he be doing , in fact , but what very many of our first families have done , or ought to do ? there will be nothing singular in his case ; and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering , as it always does of our conduct . i have great hope of prevailing . we must be serious and decided ; for after all , the person who has contracted debts must pay them ; and though a great deal is due to the feelings of the gentleman , and the head of a house , like your father , there is still more due to the character of an honest man . ”
austen	persuasion	this was the principle on which anne wanted her father to be proceeding , his friends to be urging him . she considered it as an act of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure , and saw no dignity in anything short of it . she wanted it to be prescribed , and felt as a duty . she rated lady russell ’ s influence highly ; and as to the severe degree of self-denial which her own conscience prompted , she believed there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete , than to half a reformation . her knowledge of her father and elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of both , and so on , through the whole list of lady russell ’ s too gentle reductions .
austen	persuasion	how anne ’ s more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little consequence . lady russell ’ s had no success at all : could not be put up with , were not to be borne . “ what ! every comfort of life knocked off ! journeys , london , servants , horses , table—contractions and restrictions every where ! to live no longer with the decencies even of a private gentleman ! no , he would sooner quit kellynch hall at once , than remain in it on such disgraceful terms . ”
austen	persuasion	“ quit kellynch hall. ” the hint was immediately taken up by mr shepherd , whose interest was involved in the reality of sir walter ’ s retrenching , and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without a change of abode . “ since the idea had been started in the very quarter which ought to dictate , he had no scruple , ” he said , “ in confessing his judgement to be entirely on that side . it did not appear to him that sir walter could materially alter his style of living in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support . in any other place sir walter might judge for himself ; and would be looked up to , as regulating the modes of life in whatever way he might choose to model his household . ”
austen	persuasion	sir walter would quit kellynch hall ; and after a very few days more of doubt and indecision , the great question of whither he should go was settled , and the first outline of this important change made out .
austen	persuasion	there had been three alternatives , london , bath , or another house in the country . all anne ’ s wishes had been for the latter . a small house in their own neighbourhood , where they might still have lady russell ’ s society , still be near mary , and still have the pleasure of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of kellynch , was the object of her ambition . but the usual fate of anne attended her , in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on . she disliked bath , and did not think it agreed with her ; and bath was to be her home .
austen	persuasion	sir walter had at first thought more of london ; but mr shepherd felt that he could not be trusted in london , and had been skilful enough to dissuade him from it , and make bath preferred . it was a much safer place for a gentleman in his predicament : he might there be important at comparatively little expense . two material advantages of bath over london had of course been given all their weight : its more convenient distance from kellynch , only fifty miles , and lady russell ’ s spending some part of every winter there ; and to the very great satisfaction of lady russell , whose first views on the projected change had been for bath , sir walter and elizabeth were induced to believe that they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there .
austen	persuasion	lady russell felt obliged to oppose her dear anne ’ s known wishes . it would be too much to expect sir walter to descend into a small house in his own neighbourhood . anne herself would have found the mortifications of it more than she foresaw , and to sir walter ’ s feelings they must have been dreadful . and with regard to anne ’ s dislike of bath , she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising , first , from the circumstance of her having been three years at school there , after her mother ’ s death ; and secondly , from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she had afterwards spent there with herself .
austen	persuasion	lady russell was fond of bath , in short , and disposed to think it must suit them all ; and as to her young friend ’ s health , by passing all the warm months with her at kellynch lodge , every danger would be avoided ; and it was in fact , a change which must do both health and spirits good . anne had been too little from home , too little seen . her spirits were not high . a larger society would improve them . she wanted her to be more known .
austen	persuasion	the undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood for sir walter was certainly much strengthened by one part , and a very material part of the scheme , which had been happily engrafted on the beginning . he was not only to quit his home , but to see it in the hands of others ; a trial of fortitude , which stronger heads than sir walter ’ s have found too much . kellynch hall was to be let . this , however , was a profound secret , not to be breathed beyond their own circle .
austen	persuasion	sir walter could not have borne the degradation of being known to design letting his house . mr shepherd had once mentioned the word “ advertise , ” but never dared approach it again . sir walter spurned the idea of its being offered in any manner ; forbad the slightest hint being dropped of his having such an intention ; and it was only on the supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most unexceptionable applicant , on his own terms , and as a great favour , that he would let it at all .
austen	persuasion	how quick come the reasons for approving what we like ! lady russell had another excellent one at hand , for being extremely glad that sir walter and his family were to remove from the country . elizabeth had been lately forming an intimacy , which she wished to see interrupted . it was with the daughter of mr shepherd , who had returned , after an unprosperous marriage , to her father ’ s house , with the additional burden of two children . she was a clever young woman , who understood the art of pleasing—the art of pleasing , at least , at kellynch hall ; and who had made herself so acceptable to miss elliot , as to have been already staying there more than once , in spite of all that lady russell , who thought it a friendship quite out of place , could hint of caution and reserve .
austen	persuasion	lady russell , indeed , had scarcely any influence with elizabeth , and seemed to love her , rather because she would love her , than because elizabeth deserved it . she had never received from her more than outward attention , nothing beyond the observances of complaisance ; had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry , against previous inclination . she had been repeatedly very earnest in trying to get anne included in the visit to london , sensibly open to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut her out , and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience ; but always in vain : elizabeth would go her own way ; and never had she pursued it in more decided opposition to lady russell than in this selection of mrs clay ; turning from the society of so deserving a sister , to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility .
austen	persuasion	from situation , mrs clay was , in lady russell ’ s estimate , a very unequal , and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion ; and a removal that would leave mrs clay behind , and bring a choice of more suitable intimates within miss elliot ’ s reach , was therefore an object of first-rate importance .
austen	persuasion	chapter iii . “ i must take leave to observe , sir walter , ” said mr shepherd one morning at kellynch hall , as he laid down the newspaper , “ that the present juncture is much in our favour . this peace will be turning all our rich naval officers ashore . they will be all wanting a home . could not be a better time , sir walter , for having a choice of tenants , very responsible tenants . many a noble fortune has been made during the war . if a rich admiral were to come in our way , sir walter— ”
austen	persuasion	“ he would be a very lucky man , shepherd , ” replied sir walter ; “ that ’ s all i have to remark . a prize indeed would kellynch hall be to him ; rather the greatest prize of all , let him have taken ever so many before ; hey , shepherd ? ”
austen	persuasion	mr shepherd laughed , as he knew he must , at this wit , and then added— “ i presume to observe , sir walter , that , in the way of business , gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with . i have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business ; and i am free to confess that they have very liberal notions , and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with . therefore , sir walter , what i would take leave to suggest is , that if in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention ; which must be contemplated as a possible thing , because we know how difficult it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other ; consequence has its tax ; i , john shepherd , might conceal any family-matters that i chose , for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me ; but sir walter elliot has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude ; and therefore , thus much i venture upon , that it will not greatly surprise me if , with all our caution , some rumour of the truth should get abroad ; in the supposition of which , as i was going to observe , since applications will unquestionably follow , i should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to ; and beg leave to add , that two hours will bring me over at any time , to save you the trouble of replying . ”
austen	persuasion	sir walter only nodded . but soon afterwards , rising and pacing the room , he observed sarcastically— “ there are few among the gentlemen of the navy , i imagine , who would not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description . ”
austen	persuasion	“ they would look around them , no doubt , and bless their good fortune , ” said mrs clay , for mrs clay was present : her father had driven her over , nothing being of so much use to mrs clay ’ s health as a drive to kellynch : “ but i quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant . i have known a good deal of the profession ; and besides their liberality , they are so neat and careful in all their ways ! these valuable pictures of yours , sir walter , if you chose to leave them , would be perfectly safe . everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of ! the gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now . you need not be afraid , miss elliot , of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected . ”
austen	persuasion	“ as to all that , ” rejoined sir walter coolly , “ supposing i were induced to let my house , i have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it . i am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant . the park would be open to him of course , and few navy officers , or men of any other description , can have had such a range ; but what restrictions i might impose on the use of the pleasure-grounds , is another thing . i am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable ; and i should recommend miss elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden . i am very little disposed to grant a tenant of kellynch hall any extraordinary favour , i assure you , be he sailor or soldier . ”
austen	persuasion	after a short pause , mr shepherd presumed to say— “ in all these cases , there are established usages which make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant . your interest , sir walter , is in pretty safe hands . depend upon me for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights . i venture to hint , that sir walter elliot can not be half so jealous for his own , as john shepherd will be for him . ”
austen	persuasion	here anne spoke— “ the navy , i think , who have done so much for us , have at least an equal claim with any other set of men , for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give . sailors work hard enough for their comforts , we must all allow . ”
austen	persuasion	“ very true , very true . what miss anne says , is very true , ” was mr shepherd ’ s rejoinder , and “ oh ! certainly , ” was his daughter ’ s ; but sir walter ’ s remark was , soon afterwards— “ the profession has its utility , but i should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it . ”
austen	persuasion	“ indeed ! ” was the reply , and with a look of surprise . “ yes ; it is in two points offensive to me ; i have two strong grounds of objection to it . first , as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction , and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of ; and secondly , as it cuts up a man ’ s youth and vigour most horribly ; a sailor grows old sooner than any other man . i have observed it all my life . a man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father , his father might have disdained to speak to , and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself , than in any other line . one day last spring , in town , i was in company with two men , striking instances of what i am talking of ; lord st ives , whose father we all know to have been a country curate , without bread to eat ; i was to give place to lord st ives , and a certain admiral baldwin , the most deplorable-looking personage you can imagine ; his face the colour of mahogany , rough and rugged to the last degree ; all lines and wrinkles , nine grey hairs of a side , and nothing but a dab of powder at top . ‘ in the name of heaven , who is that old fellow ? ’ said i to a friend of mine who was standing near , ( sir basil morley ) . ‘ old fellow ! ’ cried sir basil , ‘ it is admiral baldwin . what do you take his age to be ? ’ ‘ sixty , ’ said i , ‘ or perhaps sixty-two. ’ ‘ forty , ’ replied sir basil , ‘ forty , and no more. ’ picture to yourselves my amazement ; i shall not easily forget admiral baldwin . i never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea-faring life can do ; but to a degree , i know it is the same with them all : they are all knocked about , and exposed to every climate , and every weather , till they are not fit to be seen . it is a pity they are not knocked on the head at once , before they reach admiral baldwin ’ s age . ”
austen	persuasion	“ nay , sir walter , ” cried mrs clay , “ this is being severe indeed . have a little mercy on the poor men . we are not all born to be handsome . the sea is no beautifier , certainly ; sailors do grow old betimes ; i have observed it ; they soon lose the look of youth . but then , is not it the same with many other professions , perhaps most other ? soldiers , in active service , are not at all better off : and even in the quieter professions , there is a toil and a labour of the mind , if not of the body , which seldom leaves a man ’ s looks to the natural effect of time . the lawyer plods , quite care-worn ; the physician is up at all hours , and travelling in all weather ; and even the clergyman— ” she stopt a moment to consider what might do for the clergyman ; — “ and even the clergyman , you know is obliged to go into infected rooms , and expose his health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere . in fact , as i have long been convinced , though every profession is necessary and honourable in its turn , it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any , who can live in a regular way , in the country , choosing their own hours , following their own pursuits , and living on their own property , without the torment of trying for more ; it is only _their_ lot , i say , to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost : i know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young . ”
austen	persuasion	it seemed as if mr shepherd , in this anxiety to bespeak sir walter ’ s good will towards a naval officer as tenant , had been gifted with foresight ; for the very first application for the house was from an admiral croft , with whom he shortly afterwards fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at taunton ; and indeed , he had received a hint of the admiral from a london correspondent . by the report which he hastened over to kellynch to make , admiral croft was a native of somersetshire , who having acquired a very handsome fortune , was wishing to settle in his own country , and had come down to taunton in order to look at some advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood , which , however , had not suited him ; that accidentally hearing— ( it was just as he had foretold , mr shepherd observed , sir walter ’ s concerns could not be kept a secret , ) —accidentally hearing of the possibility of kellynch hall being to let , and understanding his ( mr shepherd ’ s ) connection with the owner , he had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries , and had , in the course of a pretty long conference , expressed as strong an inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description could feel ; and given mr shepherd , in his explicit account of himself , every proof of his being a most responsible , eligible tenant .
austen	persuasion	“ and who is admiral croft ? ” was sir walter ’ s cold suspicious inquiry . mr shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman ’ s family , and mentioned a place ; and anne , after the little pause which followed , added—
austen	persuasion	“ he is a rear admiral of the white . he was in the trafalgar action , and has been in the east indies since ; he was stationed there , i believe , several years . ”
austen	persuasion	“ then i take it for granted , ” observed sir walter , “ that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery. ” mr shepherd hastened to assure him , that admiral croft was a very hale , hearty , well-looking man , a little weather-beaten , to be sure , but not much , and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour ; not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms , only wanted a comfortable home , and to get into it as soon as possible ; knew he must pay for his convenience ; knew what rent a ready-furnished house of that consequence might fetch ; should not have been surprised if sir walter had asked more ; had inquired about the manor ; would be glad of the deputation , certainly , but made no great point of it ; said he sometimes took out a gun , but never killed ; quite the gentleman .
austen	persuasion	mr shepherd was eloquent on the subject ; pointing out all the circumstances of the admiral ’ s family , which made him peculiarly desirable as a tenant . he was a married man , and without children ; the very state to be wished for . a house was never taken good care of , mr shepherd observed , without a lady : he did not know , whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering as much where there was no lady , as where there were many children . a lady , without a family , was the very best preserver of furniture in the world . he had seen mrs croft , too ; she was at taunton with the admiral , and had been present almost all the time they were talking the matter over .
austen	persuasion	“ and a very well-spoken , genteel , shrewd lady , she seemed to be , ” continued he ; “ asked more questions about the house , and terms , and taxes , than the admiral himself , and seemed more conversant with business ; and moreover , sir walter , i found she was not quite unconnected in this country , any more than her husband ; that is to say , she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once ; she told me so herself : sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at monkford . bless me ! what was his name ? at this moment i can not recollect his name , though i have heard it so lately . penelope , my dear , can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at monkford : mrs croft ’ s brother ? ”
austen	persuasion	but mrs clay was talking so eagerly with miss elliot , that she did not hear the appeal . “ i have no conception whom you can mean , shepherd ; i remember no gentleman resident at monkford since the time of old governor trent . ”
austen	persuasion	“ bless me ! how very odd ! i shall forget my own name soon , i suppose . a name that i am so very well acquainted with ; knew the gentleman so well by sight ; seen him a hundred times ; came to consult me once , i remember , about a trespass of one of his neighbours ; farmer ’ s man breaking into his orchard ; wall torn down ; apples stolen ; caught in the fact ; and afterwards , contrary to my judgement , submitted to an amicable compromise . very odd indeed ! ”
austen	persuasion	after waiting another moment— “ you mean mr wentworth , i suppose ? ” said anne . mr shepherd was all gratitude . “ wentworth was the very name ! mr wentworth was the very man . he had the curacy of monkford , you know , sir walter , some time back , for two or three years . came there about the year —-5 , i take it . you remember him , i am sure . ”
austen	persuasion	“ wentworth ? oh ! ay , —mr wentworth , the curate of monkford . you misled me by the term _gentleman_ . i thought you were speaking of some man of property : mr wentworth was nobody , i remember ; quite unconnected ; nothing to do with the strafford family . one wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common . ”
austen	persuasion	as mr shepherd perceived that this connexion of the crofts did them no service with sir walter , he mentioned it no more ; returning , with all his zeal , to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in their favour ; their age , and number , and fortune ; the high idea they had formed of kellynch hall , and extreme solicitude for the advantage of renting it ; making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of sir walter elliot : an extraordinary taste , certainly , could they have been supposed in the secret of sir walter ’ s estimate of the dues of a tenant .
austen	persuasion	it succeeded , however ; and though sir walter must ever look with an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house , and think them infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms , he was talked into allowing mr shepherd to proceed in the treaty , and authorising him to wait on admiral croft , who still remained at taunton , and fix a day for the house being seen .
austen	persuasion	sir walter was not very wise ; but still he had experience enough of the world to feel , that a more unobjectionable tenant , in all essentials , than admiral croft bid fair to be , could hardly offer . so far went his understanding ; and his vanity supplied a little additional soothing , in the admiral ’ s situation in life , which was just high enough , and not too high . “ i have let my house to admiral croft , ” would sound extremely well ; very much better than to any mere _mr._—— ; a _mr._ ( save , perhaps , some half dozen in the nation , ) always needs a note of explanation . an admiral speaks his own consequence , and , at the same time , can never make a baronet look small . in all their dealings and intercourse , sir walter elliot must ever have the precedence .
austen	persuasion	nothing could be done without a reference to elizabeth : but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal , that she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand ; and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her .
austen	persuasion	mr shepherd was completely empowered to act ; and no sooner had such an end been reached , than anne , who had been a most attentive listener to the whole , left the room , to seek the comfort of cool air for her flushed cheeks ; and as she walked along a favourite grove , said , with a gentle sigh , “ a few months more , and _he_ , perhaps , may be walking here . ”
austen	persuasion	chapter iv . _he_ was not mr wentworth , the former curate of monkford , however suspicious appearances may be , but a captain frederick wentworth , his brother , who being made commander in consequence of the action off st domingo , and not immediately employed , had come into somersetshire , in the summer of 1806 ; and having no parent living , found a home for half a year at monkford . he was , at that time , a remarkably fine young man , with a great deal of intelligence , spirit , and brilliancy ; and anne an extremely pretty girl , with gentleness , modesty , taste , and feeling . half the sum of attraction , on either side , might have been enough , for he had nothing to do , and she had hardly anybody to love ; but the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail . they were gradually acquainted , and when acquainted , rapidly and deeply in love . it would be difficult to say which had seen highest perfection in the other , or which had been the happiest : she , in receiving his declarations and proposals , or he in having them accepted .
austen	persuasion	a short period of exquisite felicity followed , and but a short one . troubles soon arose . sir walter , on being applied to , without actually withholding his consent , or saying it should never be , gave it all the negative of great astonishment , great coldness , great silence , and a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter . he thought it a very degrading alliance ; and lady russell , though with more tempered and pardonable pride , received it as a most unfortunate one .
austen	persuasion	anne elliot , with all her claims of birth , beauty , and mind , to throw herself away at nineteen ; involve herself at nineteen in an engagement with a young man , who had nothing but himself to recommend him , and no hopes of attaining affluence , but in the chances of a most uncertain profession , and no connexions to secure even his farther rise in the profession , would be , indeed , a throwing away , which she grieved to think of ! anne elliot , so young ; known to so few , to be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune ; or rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing , anxious , youth-killing dependence ! it must not be , if by any fair interference of friendship , any representations from one who had almost a mother ’ s love , and mother ’ s rights , it would be prevented .
austen	persuasion	captain wentworth had no fortune . he had been lucky in his profession ; but spending freely , what had come freely , had realized nothing . but he was confident that he should soon be rich : full of life and ardour , he knew that he should soon have a ship , and soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted . he had always been lucky ; he knew he should be so still . such confidence , powerful in its own warmth , and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it , must have been enough for anne ; but lady russell saw it very differently . his sanguine temper , and fearlessness of mind , operated very differently on her . she saw in it but an aggravation of the evil . it only added a dangerous character to himself . he was brilliant , he was headstrong . lady russell had little taste for wit , and of anything approaching to imprudence a horror . she deprecated the connexion in every light .
austen	persuasion	such opposition , as these feelings produced , was more than anne could combat . young and gentle as she was , it might yet have been possible to withstand her father ’ s ill-will , though unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister ; but lady russell , whom she had always loved and relied on , could not , with such steadiness of opinion , and such tenderness of manner , be continually advising her in vain . she was persuaded to believe the engagement a wrong thing : indiscreet , improper , hardly capable of success , and not deserving it . but it was not a merely selfish caution , under which she acted , in putting an end to it . had she not imagined herself consulting his good , even more than her own , she could hardly have given him up . the belief of being prudent , and self-denying , principally for _his_ advantage , was her chief consolation , under the misery of a parting , a final parting ; and every consolation was required , for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions , on his side , totally unconvinced and unbending , and of his feeling himself ill used by so forced a relinquishment . he had left the country in consequence .
austen	persuasion	a few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance ; but not with a few months ended anne ’ s share of suffering from it . her attachment and regrets had , for a long time , clouded every enjoyment of youth , and an early loss of bloom and spirits had been their lasting effect .
austen	persuasion	more than seven years were gone since this little history of sorrowful interest had reached its close ; and time had softened down much , perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him , but she had been too dependent on time alone ; no aid had been given in change of place ( except in one visit to bath soon after the rupture ) , or in any novelty or enlargement of society . no one had ever come within the kellynch circle , who could bear a comparison with frederick wentworth , as he stood in her memory . no second attachment , the only thoroughly natural , happy , and sufficient cure , at her time of life , had been possible to the nice tone of her mind , the fastidiousness of her taste , in the small limits of the society around them . she had been solicited , when about two-and-twenty , to change her name , by the young man , who not long afterwards found a more willing mind in her younger sister ; and lady russell had lamented her refusal ; for charles musgrove was the eldest son of a man , whose landed property and general importance were second in that country , only to sir walter ’ s , and of good character and appearance ; and however lady russell might have asked yet for something more , while anne was nineteen , she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty-two so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of her father ’ s house , and settled so permanently near herself . but in this case , anne had left nothing for advice to do ; and though lady russell , as satisfied as ever with her own discretion , never wished the past undone , she began now to have the anxiety which borders on hopelessness for anne ’ s being tempted , by some man of talents and independence , to enter a state for which she held her to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits .
austen	persuasion	they knew not each other ’ s opinion , either its constancy or its change , on the one leading point of anne ’ s conduct , for the subject was never alluded to ; but anne , at seven-and-twenty , thought very differently from what she had been made to think at nineteen . she did not blame lady russell , she did not blame herself for having been guided by her ; but she felt that were any young person , in similar circumstances , to apply to her for counsel , they would never receive any of such certain immediate wretchedness , such uncertain future good . she was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home , and every anxiety attending his profession , all their probable fears , delays , and disappointments , she should yet have been a happier woman in maintaining the engagement , than she had been in the sacrifice of it ; and this , she fully believed , had the usual share , had even more than the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs , without reference to the actual results of their case , which , as it happened , would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be reasonably calculated on . all his sanguine expectations , all his confidence had been justified . his genius and ardour had seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path . he had , very soon after their engagement ceased , got employ : and all that he had told her would follow , had taken place . he had distinguished himself , and early gained the other step in rank , and must now , by successive captures , have made a handsome fortune . she had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority , but she could not doubt his being rich ; and , in favour of his constancy , she had no reason to believe him married .
austen	persuasion	how eloquent could anne elliot have been ! how eloquent , at least , were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment , and a cheerful confidence in futurity , against that over-anxious caution which seems to insult exertion and distrust providence ! she had been forced into prudence in her youth , she learned romance as she grew older : the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning .
austen	persuasion	with all these circumstances , recollections and feelings , she could not hear that captain wentworth ’ s sister was likely to live at kellynch without a revival of former pain ; and many a stroll , and many a sigh , were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea . she often told herself it was folly , before she could harden her nerves sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the crofts and their business no evil . she was assisted , however , by that perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness , among the only three of her own friends in the secret of the past , which seemed almost to deny any recollection of it . she could do justice to the superiority of lady russell ’ s motives in this , over those of her father and elizabeth ; she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness ; but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important from whatever it sprung ; and in the event of admiral croft ’ s really taking kellynch hall , she rejoiced anew over the conviction which had always been most grateful to her , of the past being known to those three only among her connexions , by whom no syllable , she believed , would ever be whispered , and in the trust that among his , the brother only with whom he had been residing , had received any information of their short-lived engagement . that brother had been long removed from the country and being a sensible man , and , moreover , a single man at the time , she had a fond dependence on no human creature ’ s having heard of it from him .
austen	persuasion	the sister , mrs croft , had then been out of england , accompanying her husband on a foreign station , and her own sister , mary , had been at school while it all occurred ; and never admitted by the pride of some , and the delicacy of others , to the smallest knowledge of it afterwards .
austen	persuasion	with these supports , she hoped that the acquaintance between herself and the crofts , which , with lady russell , still resident in kellynch , and mary fixed only three miles off , must be anticipated , need not involve any particular awkwardness .
austen	persuasion	chapter v. on the morning appointed for admiral and mrs croft ’ s seeing kellynch hall , anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to lady russell ’ s , and keep out of the way till all was over ; when she found it most natural to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them .
austen	persuasion	this meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory , and decided the whole business at once . each lady was previously well disposed for an agreement , and saw nothing , therefore , but good manners in the other ; and with regard to the gentlemen , there was such an hearty good humour , such an open , trusting liberality on the admiral ’ s side , as could not but influence sir walter , who had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished behaviour by mr shepherd ’ s assurances of his being known , by report , to the admiral , as a model of good breeding .
austen	persuasion	the house and grounds , and furniture , were approved , the crofts were approved , terms , time , every thing , and every body , was right ; and mr shepherd ’ s clerks were set to work , without there having been a single preliminary difference to modify of all that “ this indenture sheweth . ”
austen	persuasion	sir walter , without hesitation , declared the admiral to be the best-looking sailor he had ever met with , and went so far as to say , that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair , he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where ; and the admiral , with sympathetic cordiality , observed to his wife as they drove back through the park , “ i thought we should soon come to a deal , my dear , in spite of what they told us at taunton . the baronet will never set the thames on fire , but there seems to be no harm in him. ” —reciprocal compliments , which would have been esteemed about equal .
austen	persuasion	the crofts were to have possession at michaelmas ; and as sir walter proposed removing to bath in the course of the preceding month , there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement .
austen	persuasion	lady russell , convinced that anne would not be allowed to be of any use , or any importance , in the choice of the house which they were going to secure , was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon , and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might convey her to bath herself after christmas ; but having engagements of her own which must take her from kellynch for several weeks , she was unable to give the full invitation she wished , and anne though dreading the possible heats of september in all the white glare of bath , and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad of the autumnal months in the country , did not think that , everything considered , she wished to remain . it would be most right , and most wise , and , therefore must involve least suffering to go with the others .
austen	persuasion	something occurred , however , to give her a different duty . mary , often a little unwell , and always thinking a great deal of her own complaints , and always in the habit of claiming anne when anything was the matter , was indisposed ; and foreseeing that she should not have a day ’ s health all the autumn , entreated , or rather required her , for it was hardly entreaty , to come to uppercross cottage , and bear her company as long as she should want her , instead of going to bath .
austen	persuasion	“ i can not possibly do without anne , ” was mary ’ s reasoning ; and elizabeth ’ s reply was , “ then i am sure anne had better stay , for nobody will want her in bath. ” to be claimed as a good , though in an improper style , is at least better than being rejected as no good at all ; and anne , glad to be thought of some use , glad to have anything marked out as a duty , and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country , and her own dear country , readily agreed to stay .
austen	persuasion	this invitation of mary ’ s removed all lady russell ’ s difficulties , and it was consequently soon settled that anne should not go to bath till lady russell took her , and that all the intervening time should be divided between uppercross cottage and kellynch lodge .
austen	persuasion	so far all was perfectly right ; but lady russell was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the kellynch hall plan , when it burst on her , which was , mrs clay ’ s being engaged to go to bath with sir walter and elizabeth , as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in all the business before her . lady russell was extremely sorry that such a measure should have been resorted to at all , wondered , grieved , and feared ; and the affront it contained to anne , in mrs clay ’ s being of so much use , while anne could be of none , was a very sore aggravation .
austen	persuasion	anne herself was become hardened to such affronts ; but she felt the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as lady russell . with a great deal of quiet observation , and a knowledge , which she often wished less , of her father ’ s character , she was sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy were more than possible . she did not imagine that her father had at present an idea of the kind . mrs clay had freckles , and a projecting tooth , and a clumsy wrist , which he was continually making severe remarks upon , in her absence ; but she was young , and certainly altogether well-looking , and possessed , in an acute mind and assiduous pleasing manners , infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merely personal might have been . anne was so impressed by the degree of their danger , that she could not excuse herself from trying to make it perceptible to her sister . she had little hope of success ; but elizabeth , who in the event of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than herself , should never , she thought , have reason to reproach her for giving no warning .
austen	persuasion	she spoke , and seemed only to offend . elizabeth could not conceive how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her , and indignantly answered for each party ’ s perfectly knowing their situation .
austen	persuasion	“ mrs clay , ” said she , warmly , “ never forgets who she is ; and as i am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be , i can assure you , that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice , and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people . and as to my father , i really should not have thought that he , who has kept himself single so long for our sakes , need be suspected now . if mrs clay were a very beautiful woman , i grant you , it might be wrong to have her so much with me ; not that anything in the world , i am sure , would induce my father to make a degrading match , but he might be rendered unhappy . but poor mrs clay who , with all her merits , can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty , i really think poor mrs clay may be staying here in perfect safety . one would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes , though i know you must fifty times . that tooth of her ’ s and those freckles . freckles do not disgust me so very much as they do him . i have known a face not materially disfigured by a few , but he abominates them . you must have heard him notice mrs clay ’ s freckles . ”
austen	persuasion	“ there is hardly any personal defect , ” replied anne , “ which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to. ” “ i think very differently , ” answered elizabeth , shortly ; “ an agreeable manner may set off handsome features , but can never alter plain ones . however , at any rate , as i have a great deal more at stake on this point than anybody else can have , i think it rather unnecessary in you to be advising me . ”
austen	persuasion	anne had done ; glad that it was over , and not absolutely hopeless of doing good . elizabeth , though resenting the suspicion , might yet be made observant by it . the last office of the four carriage-horses was to draw sir walter , miss elliot , and mrs clay to bath . the party drove off in very good spirits ; sir walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves , and anne walked up at the same time , in a sort of desolate tranquillity , to the lodge , where she was to spend the first week .
austen	persuasion	her friend was not in better spirits than herself . lady russell felt this break-up of the family exceedingly . their respectability was as dear to her as her own , and a daily intercourse had become precious by habit . it was painful to look upon their deserted grounds , and still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into ; and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village , and be out of the way when admiral and mrs croft first arrived , she had determined to make her own absence from home begin when she must give up anne . accordingly their removal was made together , and anne was set down at uppercross cottage , in the first stage of lady russell ’ s journey .
austen	persuasion	uppercross was a moderate-sized village , which a few years back had been completely in the old english style , containing only two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers ; the mansion of the squire , with its high walls , great gates , and old trees , substantial and unmodernized , and the compact , tight parsonage , enclosed in its own neat garden , with a vine and a pear-tree trained round its casements ; but upon the marriage of the young ’ squire , it had received the improvement of a farm-house elevated into a cottage , for his residence , and uppercross cottage , with its veranda , french windows , and other prettiness , was quite as likely to catch the traveller ’ s eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and premises of the great house , about a quarter of a mile farther on .
austen	persuasion	here anne had often been staying . she knew the ways of uppercross as well as those of kellynch . the two families were so continually meeting , so much in the habit of running in and out of each other ’ s house at all hours , that it was rather a surprise to her to find mary alone ; but being alone , her being unwell and out of spirits was almost a matter of course . though better endowed than the elder sister , mary had not anne ’ s understanding nor temper . while well , and happy , and properly attended to , she had great good humour and excellent spirits ; but any indisposition sunk her completely . she had no resources for solitude ; and inheriting a considerable share of the elliot self-importance , was very prone to add to every other distress that of fancying herself neglected and ill-used . in person , she was inferior to both sisters , and had , even in her bloom , only reached the dignity of being “ a fine girl. ” she was now lying on the faded sofa of the pretty little drawing-room , the once elegant furniture of which had been gradually growing shabby , under the influence of four summers and two children ; and , on anne ’ s appearing , greeted her with—
austen	persuasion	“ so , you are come at last ! i began to think i should never see you . i am so ill i can hardly speak . i have not seen a creature the whole morning ! ”
austen	persuasion	“ i am sorry to find you unwell , ” replied anne . “ you sent me such a good account of yourself on thursday ! ” “ yes , i made the best of it ; i always do : but i was very far from well at the time ; and i do not think i ever was so ill in my life as i have been all this morning : very unfit to be left alone , i am sure . suppose i were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way , and not able to ring the bell ! so , lady russell would not get out . i do not think she has been in this house three times this summer . ”
austen	persuasion	anne said what was proper , and enquired after her husband . “ oh ! charles is out shooting . i have not seen him since seven o ’ clock . he would go , though i told him how ill i was . he said he should not stay out long ; but he has never come back , and now it is almost one . i assure you , i have not seen a soul this whole long morning . ”
austen	persuasion	“ you have had your little boys with you ? ” “ yes , as long as i could bear their noise ; but they are so unmanageable that they do me more harm than good . little charles does not mind a word i say , and walter is growing quite as bad . ”
austen	persuasion	“ well , you will soon be better now , ” replied anne , cheerfully . “ you know i always cure you when i come . how are your neighbours at the great house ? ” “ i can give you no account of them . i have not seen one of them to-day , except mr musgrove , who just stopped and spoke through the window , but without getting off his horse ; and though i told him how ill i was , not one of them have been near me . it did not happen to suit the miss musgroves , i suppose , and they never put themselves out of their way . ”
austen	persuasion	“ you will see them yet , perhaps , before the morning is gone . it is early. ” “ i never want them , i assure you . they talk and laugh a great deal too much for me . oh ! anne , i am so very unwell ! it was quite unkind of you not to come on thursday . ”
austen	persuasion	“ my dear mary , recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself ! you wrote in the cheerfullest manner , and said you were perfectly well , and in no hurry for me ; and that being the case , you must be aware that my wish would be to remain with lady russell to the last : and besides what i felt on her account , i have really been so busy , have had so much to do , that i could not very conveniently have left kellynch sooner . ”
austen	persuasion	“ dear me ! what can _you_ possibly have to do ? ” “ a great many things , i assure you . more than i can recollect in a moment ; but i can tell you some . i have been making a duplicate of the catalogue of my father ’ s books and pictures . i have been several times in the garden with mackenzie , trying to understand , and make him understand , which of elizabeth ’ s plants are for lady russell . i have had all my own little concerns to arrange , books and music to divide , and all my trunks to repack , from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons : and one thing i have had to do , mary , of a more trying nature : going to almost every house in the parish , as a sort of take-leave . i was told that they wished it . but all these things took up a great deal of time . ”
austen	persuasion	“ oh ! well ! ” and after a moment ’ s pause , “ but you have never asked me one word about our dinner at the pooles yesterday. ” “ did you go then ? i have made no enquiries , because i concluded you must have been obliged to give up the party . ”
austen	persuasion	“ oh yes ! i went . i was very well yesterday ; nothing at all the matter with me till this morning . it would have been strange if i had not gone. ” “ i am very glad you were well enough , and i hope you had a pleasant party . ”
austen	persuasion	“ nothing remarkable . one always knows beforehand what the dinner will be , and who will be there ; and it is so very uncomfortable not having a carriage of one ’ s own . mr and mrs musgrove took me , and we were so crowded ! they are both so very large , and take up so much room ; and mr musgrove always sits forward . so , there was i , crowded into the back seat with henrietta and louisa ; and i think it very likely that my illness to-day may be owing to it . ”
austen	persuasion	a little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness on anne ’ s side produced nearly a cure on mary ’ s . she could soon sit upright on the sofa , and began to hope she might be able to leave it by dinner-time . then , forgetting to think of it , she was at the other end of the room , beautifying a nosegay ; then , she ate her cold meat ; and then she was well enough to propose a little walk .
austen	persuasion	“ where shall we go ? ” said she , when they were ready . “ i suppose you will not like to call at the great house before they have been to see you ? ” “ i have not the smallest objection on that account , ” replied anne . “ i should never think of standing on such ceremony with people i know so well as mrs and the miss musgroves . ”
austen	persuasion	“ oh ! but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible . they ought to feel what is due to you as _my_ sister . however , we may as well go and sit with them a little while , and when we have that over , we can enjoy our walk . ”
austen	persuasion	anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent ; but she had ceased to endeavour to check it , from believing that , though there were on each side continual subjects of offence , neither family could now do without it . to the great house accordingly they went , to sit the full half hour in the old-fashioned square parlour , with a small carpet and shining floor , to which the present daughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion by a grand piano-forte and a harp , flower-stands and little tables placed in every direction . oh ! could the originals of the portraits against the wainscot , could the gentlemen in brown velvet and the ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on , have been conscious of such an overthrow of all order and neatness ! the portraits themselves seemed to be staring in astonishment .
austen	persuasion	the musgroves , like their houses , were in a state of alteration , perhaps of improvement . the father and mother were in the old english style , and the young people in the new . mr and mrs musgrove were a very good sort of people ; friendly and hospitable , not much educated , and not at all elegant . their children had more modern minds and manners . there was a numerous family ; but the only two grown up , excepting charles , were henrietta and louisa , young ladies of nineteen and twenty , who had brought from school at exeter all the usual stock of accomplishments , and were now like thousands of other young ladies , living to be fashionable , happy , and merry . their dress had every advantage , their faces were rather pretty , their spirits extremely good , their manner unembarrassed and pleasant ; they were of consequence at home , and favourites abroad . anne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures of her acquaintance ; but still , saved as we all are , by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility of exchange , she would not have given up her own more elegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments ; and envied them nothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together , that good-humoured mutual affection , of which she had known so little herself with either of her sisters .
austen	persuasion	they were received with great cordiality . nothing seemed amiss on the side of the great house family , which was generally , as anne very well knew , the least to blame . the half hour was chatted away pleasantly enough ; and she was not at all surprised , at the end of it , to have their walking party joined by both the miss musgroves , at mary ’ s particular invitation .
austen	persuasion	chapter vi . anne had not wanted this visit to uppercross , to learn that a removal from one set of people to another , though at a distance of only three miles , will often include a total change of conversation , opinion , and idea . she had never been staying there before , without being struck by it , or without wishing that other elliots could have her advantage in seeing how unknown , or unconsidered there , were the affairs which at kellynch hall were treated as of such general publicity and pervading interest ; yet , with all this experience , she believed she must now submit to feel that another lesson , in the art of knowing our own nothingness beyond our own circle , was become necessary for her ; for certainly , coming as she did , with a heart full of the subject which had been completely occupying both houses in kellynch for many weeks , she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found in the separate but very similar remark of mr and mrs musgrove : “ so , miss anne , sir walter and your sister are gone ; and what part of bath do you think they will settle in ? ” and this , without much waiting for an answer ; or in the young ladies ’ addition of , “ i hope _we_ shall be in bath in the winter ; but remember , papa , if we do go , we must be in a good situation : none of your queen squares for us ! ” or in the anxious supplement from mary , of— “ upon my word , i shall be pretty well off , when you are all gone away to be happy at bath ! ”
austen	persuasion	she could only resolve to avoid such self-delusion in future , and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one such truly sympathising friend as lady russell . the mr musgroves had their own game to guard , and to destroy , their own horses , dogs , and newspapers to engage them , and the females were fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping , neighbours , dress , dancing , and music . she acknowledged it to be very fitting , that every little social commonwealth should dictate its own matters of discourse ; and hoped , ere long , to become a not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into . with the prospect of spending at least two months at uppercross , it was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination , her memory , and all her ideas in as much of uppercross as possible .
austen	persuasion	she had no dread of these two months . mary was not so repulsive and unsisterly as elizabeth , nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers ; neither was there anything among the other component parts of the cottage inimical to comfort . she was always on friendly terms with her brother-in-law ; and in the children , who loved her nearly as well , and respected her a great deal more than their mother , she had an object of interest , amusement , and wholesome exertion .
austen	persuasion	charles musgrove was civil and agreeable ; in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife , but not of powers , or conversation , or grace , to make the past , as they were connected together , at all a dangerous contemplation ; though , at the same time , anne could believe , with lady russell , that a more equal match might have greatly improved him ; and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character , and more usefulness , rationality , and elegance to his habits and pursuits . as it was , he did nothing with much zeal , but sport ; and his time was otherwise trifled away , without benefit from books or anything else . he had very good spirits , which never seemed much affected by his wife ’ s occasional lowness , bore with her unreasonableness sometimes to anne ’ s admiration , and upon the whole , though there was very often a little disagreement ( in which she had sometimes more share than she wished , being appealed to by both parties ) , they might pass for a happy couple . they were always perfectly agreed in the want of more money , and a strong inclination for a handsome present from his father ; but here , as on most topics , he had the superiority , for while mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made , he always contended for his father ’ s having many other uses for his money , and a right to spend it as he liked .
austen	persuasion	as to the management of their children , his theory was much better than his wife ’ s , and his practice not so bad . “ i could manage them very well , if it were not for mary ’ s interference , ” was what anne often heard him say , and had a good deal of faith in ; but when listening in turn to mary ’ s reproach of “ charles spoils the children so that i can not get them into any order , ” she never had the smallest temptation to say , “ very true . ”
austen	persuasion	one of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there was her being treated with too much confidence by all parties , and being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house . known to have some influence with her sister , she was continually requested , or at least receiving hints to exert it , beyond what was practicable . “ i wish you could persuade mary not to be always fancying herself ill , ” was charles ’ s language ; and , in an unhappy mood , thus spoke mary : “ i do believe if charles were to see me dying , he would not think there was anything the matter with me . i am sure , anne , if you would , you might persuade him that i really am very ill—a great deal worse than i ever own . ”
austen	persuasion	mary ’ s declaration was , “ i hate sending the children to the great house , though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them , for she humours and indulges them to such a degree , and gives them so much trash and sweet things , that they are sure to come back sick and cross for the rest of the day. ” and mrs musgrove took the first opportunity of being alone with anne , to say , “ oh ! miss anne , i can not help wishing mrs charles had a little of your method with those children . they are quite different creatures with you ! but to be sure , in general they are so spoilt ! it is a pity you can not put your sister in the way of managing them . they are as fine healthy children as ever were seen , poor little dears ! without partiality ; but mrs charles knows no more how they should be treated— ! bless me ! how troublesome they are sometimes . i assure you , miss anne , it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as i otherwise should . i believe mrs charles is not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener ; but you know it is very bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking every moment ; “ don ’ t do this , ” and “ don ’ t do that ; ” or that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them . ”
austen	persuasion	she had this communication , moreover , from mary . “ mrs musgrove thinks all her servants so steady , that it would be high treason to call it in question ; but i am sure , without exaggeration , that her upper house-maid and laundry-maid , instead of being in their business , are gadding about the village , all day long . i meet them wherever i go ; and i declare , i never go twice into my nursery without seeing something of them . if jemima were not the trustiest , steadiest creature in the world , it would be enough to spoil her ; for she tells me , they are always tempting her to take a walk with them. ” and on mrs musgrove ’ s side , it was , “ i make a rule of never interfering in any of my daughter-in-law ’ s concerns , for i know it would not do ; but i shall tell _you_ , miss anne , because you may be able to set things to rights , that i have no very good opinion of mrs charles ’ s nursery-maid : i hear strange stories of her ; she is always upon the gad ; and from my own knowledge , i can declare , she is such a fine-dressing lady , that she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near . mrs charles quite swears by her , i know ; but i just give you this hint , that you may be upon the watch ; because , if you see anything amiss , you need not be afraid of mentioning it . ”
austen	persuasion	again , it was mary ’ s complaint , that mrs musgrove was very apt not to give her the precedence that was her due , when they dined at the great house with other families ; and she did not see any reason why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place . and one day when anne was walking with only the musgroves , one of them after talking of rank , people of rank , and jealousy of rank , said , “ i have no scruple of observing to _you_ , how nonsensical some persons are about their place , because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you are about it ; but i wish anybody could give mary a hint that it would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious , especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take place of mamma . nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma , but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it . it is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world , but i know it is taken notice of by many persons . ”
austen	persuasion	how was anne to set all these matters to rights ? she could do little more than listen patiently , soften every grievance , and excuse each to the other ; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary between such near neighbours , and make those hints broadest which were meant for her sister ’ s benefit .
austen	persuasion	in all other respects , her visit began and proceeded very well . her own spirits improved by change of place and subject , by being removed three miles from kellynch ; mary ’ s ailments lessened by having a constant companion , and their daily intercourse with the other family , since there was neither superior affection , confidence , nor employment in the cottage , to be interrupted by it , was rather an advantage . it was certainly carried nearly as far as possible , for they met every morning , and hardly ever spent an evening asunder ; but she believed they should not have done so well without the sight of mr and mrs musgrove ’ s respectable forms in the usual places , or without the talking , laughing , and singing of their daughters .
austen	persuasion	she played a great deal better than either of the miss musgroves , but having no voice , no knowledge of the harp , and no fond parents , to sit by and fancy themselves delighted , her performance was little thought of , only out of civility , or to refresh the others , as she was well aware . she knew that when she played she was giving pleasure only to herself ; but this was no new sensation . excepting one short period of her life , she had never , since the age of fourteen , never since the loss of her dear mother , known the happiness of being listened to , or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste . in music she had been always used to feel alone in the world ; and mr and mrs musgrove ’ s fond partiality for their own daughters ’ performance , and total indifference to any other person ’ s , gave her much more pleasure for their sakes , than mortification for her own .
austen	persuasion	the party at the great house was sometimes increased by other company . the neighbourhood was not large , but the musgroves were visited by everybody , and had more dinner-parties , and more callers , more visitors by invitation and by chance , than any other family . they were more completely popular .
austen	persuasion	the girls were wild for dancing ; and the evenings ended , occasionally , in an unpremeditated little ball . there was a family of cousins within a walk of uppercross , in less affluent circumstances , who depended on the musgroves for all their pleasures : they would come at any time , and help play at anything , or dance anywhere ; and anne , very much preferring the office of musician to a more active post , played country dances to them by the hour together ; a kindness which always recommended her musical powers to the notice of mr and mrs musgrove more than anything else , and often drew this compliment ; — “ well done , miss anne ! very well done indeed ! lord bless me ! how those little fingers of yours fly about ! ”
austen	persuasion	so passed the first three weeks . michaelmas came ; and now anne ’ s heart must be in kellynch again . a beloved home made over to others ; all the precious rooms and furniture , groves , and prospects , beginning to own other eyes and other limbs ! she could not think of much else on the 29th of september ; and she had this sympathetic touch in the evening from mary , who , on having occasion to note down the day of the month , exclaimed , “ dear me , is not this the day the crofts were to come to kellynch ? i am glad i did not think of it before . how low it makes me ! ”
austen	persuasion	the crofts took possession with true naval alertness , and were to be visited . mary deplored the necessity for herself . “ nobody knew how much she should suffer . she should put it off as long as she could ; ” but was not easy till she had talked charles into driving her over on an early day , and was in a very animated , comfortable state of imaginary agitation , when she came back . anne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going . she wished , however to see the crofts , and was glad to be within when the visit was returned . they came : the master of the house was not at home , but the two sisters were together ; and as it chanced that mrs croft fell to the share of anne , while the admiral sat by mary , and made himself very agreeable by his good-humoured notice of her little boys , she was well able to watch for a likeness , and if it failed her in the features , to catch it in the voice , or in the turn of sentiment and expression .
austen	persuasion	mrs croft , though neither tall nor fat , had a squareness , uprightness , and vigour of form , which gave importance to her person . she had bright dark eyes , good teeth , and altogether an agreeable face ; though her reddened and weather-beaten complexion , the consequence of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband , made her seem to have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight-and-thirty . her manners were open , easy , and decided , like one who had no distrust of herself , and no doubts of what to do ; without any approach to coarseness , however , or any want of good humour . anne gave her credit , indeed , for feelings of great consideration towards herself , in all that related to kellynch , and it pleased her : especially , as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute , in the instant even of introduction , that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on mrs croft ’ s side , to give a bias of any sort . she was quite easy on that head , and consequently full of strength and courage , till for a moment electrified by mrs croft ’ s suddenly saying , —
austen	persuasion	“ it was you , and not your sister , i find , that my brother had the pleasure of being acquainted with , when he was in this country. ” anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing ; but the age of emotion she certainly had not .
austen	persuasion	“ perhaps you may not have heard that he is married ? ” added mrs croft . she could now answer as she ought ; and was happy to feel , when mrs croft ’ s next words explained it to be mr wentworth of whom she spoke , that she had said nothing which might not do for either brother . she immediately felt how reasonable it was , that mrs croft should be thinking and speaking of edward , and not of frederick ; and with shame at her own forgetfulness applied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbour ’ s present state with proper interest .
austen	persuasion	the rest was all tranquillity ; till , just as they were moving , she heard the admiral say to mary— “ we are expecting a brother of mrs croft ’ s here soon ; i dare say you know him by name . ”
austen	persuasion	he was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys , clinging to him like an old friend , and declaring he should not go ; and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pockets , & c. , to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had begun , anne was left to persuade herself , as well as she could , that the same brother must still be in question . she could not , however , reach such a degree of certainty , as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject at the other house , where the crofts had previously been calling .
austen	persuasion	the folks of the great house were to spend the evening of this day at the cottage ; and it being now too late in the year for such visits to be made on foot , the coach was beginning to be listened for , when the youngest miss musgrove walked in . that she was coming to apologize , and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves , was the first black idea ; and mary was quite ready to be affronted , when louisa made all right by saying , that she only came on foot , to leave more room for the harp , which was bringing in the carriage .
austen	persuasion	“ and i will tell you our reason , ” she added , “ and all about it . i am come on to give you notice , that papa and mamma are out of spirits this evening , especially mamma ; she is thinking so much of poor richard ! and we agreed it would be best to have the harp , for it seems to amuse her more than the piano-forte . i will tell you why she is out of spirits . when the crofts called this morning , ( they called here afterwards , did not they ? ) , they happened to say , that her brother , captain wentworth , is just returned to england , or paid off , or something , and is coming to see them almost directly ; and most unluckily it came into mamma ’ s head , when they were gone , that wentworth , or something very like it , was the name of poor richard ’ s captain at one time ; i do not know when or where , but a great while before he died , poor fellow ! and upon looking over his letters and things , she found it was so , and is perfectly sure that this must be the very man , and her head is quite full of it , and of poor richard ! so we must be as merry as we can , that she may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things . ”
austen	persuasion	the real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were , that the musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome , hopeless son ; and the good fortune to lose him before he reached his twentieth year ; that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid and unmanageable on shore ; that he had been very little cared for at any time by his family , though quite as much as he deserved ; seldom heard of , and scarcely at all regretted , when the intelligence of his death abroad had worked its way to uppercross , two years before .
austen	persuasion	he had , in fact , though his sisters were now doing all they could for him , by calling him “ poor richard , ” been nothing better than a thick-headed , unfeeling , unprofitable dick musgrove , who had never done anything to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name , living or dead .
austen	persuasion	he had been several years at sea , and had , in the course of those removals to which all midshipmen are liable , and especially such midshipmen as every captain wishes to get rid of , been six months on board captain frederick wentworth ’ s frigate , the laconia ; and from the laconia he had , under the influence of his captain , written the only two letters which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole of his absence ; that is to say , the only two disinterested letters ; all the rest had been mere applications for money .
austen	persuasion	in each letter he had spoken well of his captain ; but yet , so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters , so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships , that it had made scarcely any impression at the time ; and that mrs musgrove should have been suddenly struck , this very day , with a recollection of the name of wentworth , as connected with her son , seemed one of those extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur .
austen	persuasion	she had gone to her letters , and found it all as she supposed ; and the re-perusal of these letters , after so long an interval , her poor son gone for ever , and all the strength of his faults forgotten , had affected her spirits exceedingly , and thrown her into greater grief for him than she had known on first hearing of his death . mr musgrove was , in a lesser degree , affected likewise ; and when they reached the cottage , they were evidently in want , first , of being listened to anew on this subject , and afterwards , of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them .
austen	persuasion	to hear them talking so much of captain wentworth , repeating his name so often , puzzling over past years , and at last ascertaining that it _might_ , that it probably _would_ , turn out to be the very same captain wentworth whom they recollected meeting , once or twice , after their coming back from clifton—a very fine young man—but they could not say whether it was seven or eight years ago , was a new sort of trial to anne ’ s nerves . she found , however , that it was one to which she must inure herself . since he actually was expected in the country , she must teach herself to be insensible on such points . and not only did it appear that he was expected , and speedily , but the musgroves , in their warm gratitude for the kindness he had shewn poor dick , and very high respect for his character , stamped as it was by poor dick ’ s having been six months under his care , and mentioning him in strong , though not perfectly well-spelt praise , as “ a fine dashing felow , only two perticular about the schoolmaster , ” were bent on introducing themselves , and seeking his acquaintance , as soon as they could hear of his arrival .
austen	persuasion	the resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening . chapter vii . a very few days more , and captain wentworth was known to be at kellynch , and mr musgrove had called on him , and come back warm in his praise , and he was engaged with the crofts to dine at uppercross , by the end of another week . it had been a great disappointment to mr musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed , so impatient was he to shew his gratitude , by seeing captain wentworth under his own roof , and welcoming him to all that was strongest and best in his cellars . but a week must pass ; only a week , in anne ’ s reckoning , and then , she supposed , they must meet ; and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week .
austen	persuasion	captain wentworth made a very early return to mr musgrove ’ s civility , and she was all but calling there in the same half hour . she and mary were actually setting forward for the great house , where , as she afterwards learnt , they must inevitably have found him , when they were stopped by the eldest boy ’ s being at that moment brought home in consequence of a bad fall . the child ’ s situation put the visit entirely aside ; but she could not hear of her escape with indifference , even in the midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards felt on his account .
austen	persuasion	his collar-bone was found to be dislocated , and such injury received in the back , as roused the most alarming ideas . it was an afternoon of distress , and anne had every thing to do at once ; the apothecary to send for , the father to have pursued and informed , the mother to support and keep from hysterics , the servants to control , the youngest child to banish , and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe ; besides sending , as soon as she recollected it , proper notice to the other house , which brought her an accession rather of frightened , enquiring companions , than of very useful assistants .
austen	persuasion	her brother ’ s return was the first comfort ; he could take best care of his wife ; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary . till he came and had examined the child , their apprehensions were the worse for being vague ; they suspected great injury , but knew not where ; but now the collar-bone was soon replaced , and though mr robinson felt and felt , and rubbed , and looked grave , and spoke low words both to the father and the aunt , still they were all to hope the best , and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind ; and then it was , just before they parted , that the two young aunts were able so far to digress from their nephew ’ s state , as to give the information of captain wentworth ’ s visit ; staying five minutes behind their father and mother , to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with him , how much handsomer , how infinitely more agreeable they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance , who had been at all a favourite before . how glad they had been to hear papa invite him to stay dinner , how sorry when he said it was quite out of his power , and how glad again when he had promised in reply to papa and mamma ’ s farther pressing invitations to come and dine with them on the morrow—actually on the morrow ; and he had promised it in so pleasant a manner , as if he felt all the motive of their attention just as he ought . and in short , he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace , that they could assure them all , their heads were both turned by him ; and off they ran , quite as full of glee as of love , and apparently more full of captain wentworth than of little charles .
austen	persuasion	the same story and the same raptures were repeated , when the two girls came with their father , through the gloom of the evening , to make enquiries ; and mr musgrove , no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir , could add his confirmation and praise , and hope there would be now no occasion for putting captain wentworth off , and only be sorry to think that the cottage party , probably , would not like to leave the little boy , to give him the meeting . “ oh no ; as to leaving the little boy , ” both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm to bear the thought ; and anne , in the joy of the escape , could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs .
austen	persuasion	charles musgrove , indeed , afterwards , shewed more of inclination ; “ the child was going on so well , and he wished so much to be introduced to captain wentworth , that , perhaps , he might join them in the evening ; he would not dine from home , but he might walk in for half an hour. ” but in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife , with “ oh ! no , indeed , charles , i can not bear to have you go away . only think if anything should happen ? ”
austen	persuasion	the child had a good night , and was going on well the next day . it must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been done to the spine ; but mr robinson found nothing to increase alarm , and charles musgrove began , consequently , to feel no necessity for longer confinement . the child was to be kept in bed and amused as quietly as possible ; but what was there for a father to do ? this was quite a female case , and it would be highly absurd in him , who could be of no use at home , to shut himself up . his father very much wished him to meet captain wentworth , and there being no sufficient reason against it , he ought to go ; and it ended in his making a bold , public declaration , when he came in from shooting , of his meaning to dress directly , and dine at the other house .
austen	persuasion	“ nothing can be going on better than the child , ” said he ; “ so i told my father , just now , that i would come , and he thought me quite right . your sister being with you , my love , i have no scruple at all . you would not like to leave him yourself , but you see i can be of no use . anne will send for me if anything is the matter . ”
austen	persuasion	husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain . mary knew , from charles ’ s manner of speaking , that he was quite determined on going , and that it would be of no use to teaze him . she said nothing , therefore , till he was out of the room , but as soon as there was only anne to hear—
austen	persuasion	“ so you and i are to be left to shift by ourselves , with this poor sick child ; and not a creature coming near us all the evening ! i knew how it would be . this is always my luck . if there is anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it , and charles is as bad as any of them . very unfeeling ! i must say it is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy . talks of his being going on so well ! how does he know that he is going on well , or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence ? i did not think charles would have been so unfeeling . so here he is to go away and enjoy himself , and because i am the poor mother , i am not to be allowed to stir ; and yet , i am sure , i am more unfit than anybody else to be about the child . my being the mother is the very reason why my feelings should not be tried . i am not at all equal to it . you saw how hysterical i was yesterday . ”
austen	persuasion	“ but that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm—of the shock . you will not be hysterical again . i dare say we shall have nothing to distress us . i perfectly understand mr robinson ’ s directions , and have no fears ; and indeed , mary , i can not wonder at your husband . nursing does not belong to a man ; it is not his province . a sick child is always the mother ’ s property : her own feelings generally make it so . ”
austen	persuasion	“ i hope i am as fond of my child as any mother , but i do not know that i am of any more use in the sick-room than charles , for i can not be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill ; and you saw , this morning , that if i told him to keep quiet , he was sure to begin kicking about . i have not nerves for the sort of thing . ”
austen	persuasion	“ but , could you be comfortable yourself , to be spending the whole evening away from the poor boy ? ” “ yes ; you see his papa can , and why should not i ? jemima is so careful ; and she could send us word every hour how he was . i really think charles might as well have told his father we would all come . i am not more alarmed about little charles now than he is . i was dreadfully alarmed yesterday , but the case is very different to-day . ”
austen	persuasion	“ well , if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself , suppose you were to go , as well as your husband . leave little charles to my care . mr and mrs musgrove can not think it wrong while i remain with him . ”
austen	persuasion	“ are you serious ? ” cried mary , her eyes brightening . “ dear me ! that ’ s a very good thought , very good , indeed . to be sure , i may just as well go as not , for i am of no use at home—am i ? and it only harasses me . you , who have not a mother ’ s feelings , are a great deal the properest person . you can make little charles do anything ; he always minds you at a word . it will be a great deal better than leaving him only with jemima . oh ! i shall certainly go ; i am sure i ought if i can , quite as much as charles , for they want me excessively to be acquainted with captain wentworth , and i know you do not mind being left alone . an excellent thought of yours , indeed , anne . i will go and tell charles , and get ready directly . you can send for us , you know , at a moment ’ s notice , if anything is the matter ; but i dare say there will be nothing to alarm you . i should not go , you may be sure , if i did not feel quite at ease about my dear child . ”
austen	persuasion	the next moment she was tapping at her husband ’ s dressing-room door , and as anne followed her up stairs , she was in time for the whole conversation , which began with mary ’ s saying , in a tone of great exultation—
austen	persuasion	“ i mean to go with you , charles , for i am of no more use at home than you are . if i were to shut myself up for ever with the child , i should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like . anne will stay ; anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him . it is anne ’ s own proposal , and so i shall go with you , which will be a great deal better , for i have not dined at the other house since tuesday . ”
austen	persuasion	“ this is very kind of anne , ” was her husband ’ s answer , “ and i should be very glad to have you go ; but it seems rather hard that she should be left at home by herself , to nurse our sick child . ”
austen	persuasion	anne was now at hand to take up her own cause , and the sincerity of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him , where conviction was at least very agreeable , he had no farther scruples as to her being left to dine alone , though he still wanted her to join them in the evening , when the child might be at rest for the night , and kindly urged her to let him come and fetch her , but she was quite unpersuadable ; and this being the case , she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them set off together in high spirits . they were gone , she hoped , to be happy , however oddly constructed such happiness might seem ; as for herself , she was left with as many sensations of comfort , as were , perhaps , ever likely to be hers . she knew herself to be of the first utility to the child ; and what was it to her if frederick wentworth were only half a mile distant , making himself agreeable to others ?
austen	persuasion	she would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting . perhaps indifferent , if indifference could exist under such circumstances . he must be either indifferent or unwilling . had he wished ever to see her again , he need not have waited till this time ; he would have done what she could not but believe that in his place she should have done long ago , when events had been early giving him the independence which alone had been wanting .
austen	persuasion	her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance , and their visit in general . there had been music , singing , talking , laughing , all that was most agreeable ; charming manners in captain wentworth , no shyness or reserve ; they seemed all to know each other perfectly , and he was coming the very next morning to shoot with charles . he was to come to breakfast , but not at the cottage , though that had been proposed at first ; but then he had been pressed to come to the great house instead , and he seemed afraid of being in mrs charles musgrove ’ s way , on account of the child , and therefore , somehow , they hardly knew how , it ended in charles ’ s being to meet him to breakfast at his father ’ s .
austen	persuasion	anne understood it . he wished to avoid seeing her . he had inquired after her , she found , slightly , as might suit a former slight acquaintance , seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged , actuated , perhaps , by the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet .
austen	persuasion	the morning hours of the cottage were always later than those of the other house , and on the morrow the difference was so great that mary and anne were not more than beginning breakfast when charles came in to say that they were just setting off , that he was come for his dogs , that his sisters were following with captain wentworth ; his sisters meaning to visit mary and the child , and captain wentworth proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient ; and though charles had answered for the child ’ s being in no such state as could make it inconvenient , captain wentworth would not be satisfied without his running on to give notice .
austen	persuasion	mary , very much gratified by this attention , was delighted to receive him , while a thousand feelings rushed on anne , of which this was the most consoling , that it would soon be over . and it was soon over . in two minutes after charles ’ s preparation , the others appeared ; they were in the drawing-room . her eye half met captain wentworth ’ s , a bow , a curtsey passed ; she heard his voice ; he talked to mary , said all that was right , said something to the miss musgroves , enough to mark an easy footing ; the room seemed full , full of persons and voices , but a few minutes ended it . charles shewed himself at the window , all was ready , their visitor had bowed and was gone , the miss musgroves were gone too , suddenly resolving to walk to the end of the village with the sportsmen : the room was cleared , and anne might finish her breakfast as she could .
austen	persuasion	“ it is over ! it is over ! ” she repeated to herself again and again , in nervous gratitude . “ the worst is over ! ” mary talked , but she could not attend . she had seen him . they had met . they had been once more in the same room .
austen	persuasion	soon , however , she began to reason with herself , and try to be feeling less . eight years , almost eight years had passed , since all had been given up . how absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval had banished into distance and indistinctness ! what might not eight years do ? events of every description , changes , alienations , removals—all , all must be comprised in it , and oblivion of the past— how natural , how certain too ! it included nearly a third part of her own life .
austen	persuasion	alas ! with all her reasoning , she found , that to retentive feelings eight years may be little more than nothing . now , how were his sentiments to be read ? was this like wishing to avoid her ? and the next moment she was hating herself for the folly which asked the question .
austen	persuasion	on one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not have prevented , she was soon spared all suspense ; for , after the miss musgroves had returned and finished their visit at the cottage she had this spontaneous information from mary : —
austen	persuasion	“ captain wentworth is not very gallant by you , anne , though he was so attentive to me . henrietta asked him what he thought of you , when they went away , and he said , ‘ you were so altered he should not have known you again . ’ ”
austen	persuasion	mary had no feelings to make her respect her sister ’ s in a common way , but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound . “ altered beyond his knowledge. ” anne fully submitted , in silent , deep mortification . doubtless it was so , and she could take no revenge , for he was not altered , or not for the worse . she had already acknowledged it to herself , and she could not think differently , let him think of her as he would . no : the years which had destroyed her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing , manly , open look , in no respect lessening his personal advantages . she had seen the same frederick wentworth .
austen	persuasion	“ so altered that he should not have known her again ! ” these were words which could not but dwell with her . yet she soon began to rejoice that she had heard them . they were of sobering tendency ; they allayed agitation ; they composed , and consequently must make her happier .
austen	persuasion	frederick wentworth had used such words , or something like them , but without an idea that they would be carried round to her . he had thought her wretchedly altered , and in the first moment of appeal , had spoken as he felt . he had not forgiven anne elliot . she had used him ill , deserted and disappointed him ; and worse , she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so , which his own decided , confident temper could not endure . she had given him up to oblige others . it had been the effect of over-persuasion . it had been weakness and timidity .
austen	persuasion	he had been most warmly attached to her , and had never seen a woman since whom he thought her equal ; but , except from some natural sensation of curiosity , he had no desire of meeting her again . her power with him was gone for ever .
austen	persuasion	it was now his object to marry . he was rich , and being turned on shore , fully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted ; actually looking round , ready to fall in love with all the speed which a clear head and a quick taste could allow . he had a heart for either of the miss musgroves , if they could catch it ; a heart , in short , for any pleasing young woman who came in his way , excepting anne elliot . this was his only secret exception , when he said to his sister , in answer to her suppositions : —
austen	persuasion	“ yes , here i am , sophia , quite ready to make a foolish match . anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking . a little beauty , and a few smiles , and a few compliments to the navy , and i am a lost man . should not this be enough for a sailor , who has had no society among women to make him nice ? ”
austen	persuasion	he said it , she knew , to be contradicted . his bright proud eye spoke the conviction that he was nice ; and anne elliot was not out of his thoughts , when he more seriously described the woman he should wish to meet with . “ a strong mind , with sweetness of manner , ” made the first and the last of the description .
austen	persuasion	“ that is the woman i want , ” said he . “ something a little inferior i shall of course put up with , but it must not be much . if i am a fool , i shall be a fool indeed , for i have thought on the subject more than most men . ”
austen	persuasion	chapter viii . from this time captain wentworth and anne elliot were repeatedly in the same circle . they were soon dining in company together at mr musgrove ’ s , for the little boy ’ s state could no longer supply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself ; and this was but the beginning of other dinings and other meetings .
austen	persuasion	whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof ; former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each ; _they_ could not but be reverted to ; the year of their engagement could not but be named by him , in the little narratives or descriptions which conversation called forth . his profession qualified him , his disposition lead him , to talk ; and “ _that_ was in the year six ; ” “ _that_ happened before i went to sea in the year six , ” occurred in the course of the first evening they spent together : and though his voice did not falter , and though she had no reason to suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke , anne felt the utter impossibility , from her knowledge of his mind , that he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself . there must be the same immediate association of thought , though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain .
austen	persuasion	they had no conversation together , no intercourse but what the commonest civility required . once so much to each other ! now nothing ! there _had_ been a time , when of all the large party now filling the drawing-room at uppercross , they would have found it most difficult to cease to speak to one another . with the exception , perhaps , of admiral and mrs croft , who seemed particularly attached and happy , ( anne could allow no other exceptions even among the married couples ) , there could have been no two hearts so open , no tastes so similar , no feelings so in unison , no countenances so beloved . now they were as strangers ; nay , worse than strangers , for they could never become acquainted . it was a perpetual estrangement .
austen	persuasion	when he talked , she heard the same voice , and discerned the same mind . there was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party ; and he was very much questioned , and especially by the two miss musgroves , who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him , as to the manner of living on board , daily regulations , food , hours , & c. , and their surprise at his accounts , at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement which was practicable , drew from him some pleasant ridicule , which reminded anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant , and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board without anything to eat , or any cook to dress it if there were , or any servant to wait , or any knife and fork to use .
austen	persuasion	from thus listening and thinking , she was roused by a whisper of mrs musgrove ’ s who , overcome by fond regrets , could not help saying— “ ah ! miss anne , if it had pleased heaven to spare my poor son , i dare say he would have been just such another by this time . ”
austen	persuasion	anne suppressed a smile , and listened kindly , while mrs musgrove relieved her heart a little more ; and for a few minutes , therefore , could not keep pace with the conversation of the others .
austen	persuasion	when she could let her attention take its natural course again , she found the miss musgroves just fetching the navy list ( their own navy list , the first that had ever been at uppercross ) , and sitting down together to pore over it , with the professed view of finding out the ships that captain wentworth had commanded .
austen	persuasion	“ your first was the asp , i remember ; we will look for the asp. ” “ you will not find her there . quite worn out and broken up . i was the last man who commanded her . hardly fit for service then . reported fit for home service for a year or two , and so i was sent off to the west indies . ”
austen	persuasion	the girls looked all amazement . “ the admiralty , ” he continued , “ entertain themselves now and then , with sending a few hundred men to sea , in a ship not fit to be employed . but they have a great many to provide for ; and among the thousands that may just as well go to the bottom as not , it is impossible for them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed . ”
austen	persuasion	“ phoo ! phoo ! ” cried the admiral , “ what stuff these young fellows talk ! never was a better sloop than the asp in her day . for an old built sloop , you would not see her equal . lucky fellow to get her ! he knows there must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her at the same time . lucky fellow to get anything so soon , with no more interest than his . ”
austen	persuasion	“ i felt my luck , admiral , i assure you ; ” replied captain wentworth , seriously . “ i was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire . it was a great object with me at that time to be at sea ; a very great object , i wanted to be doing something . ”
austen	persuasion	“ to be sure you did . what should a young fellow like you do ashore for half a year together ? if a man had not a wife , he soon wants to be afloat again . ”
austen	persuasion	“ but , captain wentworth , ” cried louisa , “ how vexed you must have been when you came to the asp , to see what an old thing they had given you. ” “ i knew pretty well what she was before that day ; ” said he , smiling . “ i had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of any old pelisse , which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember , and which at last , on some very wet day , is lent to yourself . ah ! she was a dear old asp to me . she did all that i wanted . i knew she would . i knew that we should either go to the bottom together , or that she would be the making of me ; and i never had two days of foul weather all the time i was at sea in her ; and after taking privateers enough to be very entertaining , i had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn , to fall in with the very french frigate i wanted . i brought her into plymouth ; and here another instance of luck . we had not been six hours in the sound , when a gale came on , which lasted four days and nights , and which would have done for poor old asp in half the time ; our touch with the great nation not having much improved our condition . four-and-twenty hours later , and i should only have been a gallant captain wentworth , in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers ; and being lost in only a sloop , nobody would have thought about me. ” anne ’ s shudderings were to herself alone ; but the miss musgroves could be as open as they were sincere , in their exclamations of pity and horror .
austen	persuasion	“ and so then , i suppose , ” said mrs musgrove , in a low voice , as if thinking aloud , “ so then he went away to the laconia , and there he met with our poor boy . charles , my dear , ” ( beckoning him to her ) , “ do ask captain wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother . i always forgot . ”
austen	persuasion	“ it was at gibraltar , mother , i know . dick had been left ill at gibraltar , with a recommendation from his former captain to captain wentworth. ” “ oh ! but , charles , tell captain wentworth , he need not be afraid of mentioning poor dick before me , for it would be rather a pleasure to hear him talked of by such a good friend . ”
austen	persuasion	charles , being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case , only nodded in reply , and walked away . the girls were now hunting for the laconia ; and captain wentworth could not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume into his own hands to save them the trouble , and once more read aloud the little statement of her name and rate , and present non-commissioned class , observing over it that she too had been one of the best friends man ever had .
austen	persuasion	“ ah ! those were pleasant days when i had the laconia ! how fast i made money in her . a friend of mine and i had such a lovely cruise together off the western islands . poor harville , sister ! you know how much he wanted money : worse than myself . he had a wife . excellent fellow . i shall never forget his happiness . he felt it all , so much for her sake . i wished for him again the next summer , when i had still the same luck in the mediterranean . ”
austen	persuasion	“ and i am sure , sir , ” said mrs musgrove , “ it was a lucky day for _us_ , when you were put captain into that ship . _we_ shall never forget what you did . ”
austen	persuasion	her feelings made her speak low ; and captain wentworth , hearing only in part , and probably not having dick musgrove at all near his thoughts , looked rather in suspense , and as if waiting for more .
austen	persuasion	“ my brother , ” whispered one of the girls ; “ mamma is thinking of poor richard. ” “ poor dear fellow ! ” continued mrs musgrove ; “ he was grown so steady , and such an excellent correspondent , while he was under your care ! ah ! it would have been a happy thing , if he had never left you . i assure you , captain wentworth , we are very sorry he ever left you . ”
austen	persuasion	there was a momentary expression in captain wentworth ’ s face at this speech , a certain glance of his bright eye , and curl of his handsome mouth , which convinced anne , that instead of sharing in mrs musgrove ’ s kind wishes , as to her son , he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him ; but it was too transient an indulgence of self-amusement to be detected by any who understood him less than herself ; in another moment he was perfectly collected and serious , and almost instantly afterwards coming up to the sofa , on which she and mrs musgrove were sitting , took a place by the latter , and entered into conversation with her , in a low voice , about her son , doing it with so much sympathy and natural grace , as shewed the kindest consideration for all that was real and unabsurd in the parent ’ s feelings .
austen	persuasion	they were actually on the same sofa , for mrs musgrove had most readily made room for him ; they were divided only by mrs musgrove . it was no insignificant barrier , indeed . mrs musgrove was of a comfortable , substantial size , infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour , than tenderness and sentiment ; and while the agitations of anne ’ s slender form , and pensive face , may be considered as very completely screened , captain wentworth should be allowed some credit for the self-command with which he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son , whom alive nobody had cared for .
austen	persuasion	personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions . a large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction , as the most graceful set of limbs in the world . but , fair or not fair , there are unbecoming conjunctions , which reason will patronize in vain—which taste can not tolerate—which ridicule will seize .
austen	persuasion	the admiral , after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room with his hands behind him , being called to order by his wife , now came up to captain wentworth , and without any observation of what he might be interrupting , thinking only of his own thoughts , began with—
austen	persuasion	“ if you had been a week later at lisbon , last spring , frederick , you would have been asked to give a passage to lady mary grierson and her daughters. ” “ should i ? i am glad i was not a week later then . ”
austen	persuasion	the admiral abused him for his want of gallantry . he defended himself ; though professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies on board a ship of his , excepting for a ball , or a visit , which a few hours might comprehend .
austen	persuasion	“ but , if i know myself , ” said he , “ this is from no want of gallantry towards them . it is rather from feeling how impossible it is , with all one ’ s efforts , and all one ’ s sacrifices , to make the accommodations on board such as women ought to have . there can be no want of gallantry , admiral , in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort _high_ , and this is what i do . i hate to hear of women on board , or to see them on board ; and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere , if i can help it . ”
austen	persuasion	this brought his sister upon him . “ oh ! frederick ! but i can not believe it of you.—all idle refinement ! —women may be as comfortable on board , as in the best house in england . i believe i have lived as much on board as most women , and i know nothing superior to the accommodations of a man-of-war . i declare i have not a comfort or an indulgence about me , even at kellynch hall , ” ( with a kind bow to anne ) , “ beyond what i always had in most of the ships i have lived in ; and they have been five altogether . ”
austen	persuasion	“ nothing to the purpose , ” replied her brother . “ you were living with your husband , and were the only woman on board. ” “ but you , yourself , brought mrs harville , her sister , her cousin , and three children , round from portsmouth to plymouth . where was this superfine , extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then ? ”
austen	persuasion	“ all merged in my friendship , sophia . i would assist any brother officer ’ s wife that i could , and i would bring anything of harville ’ s from the world ’ s end , if he wanted it . but do not imagine that i did not feel it an evil in itself . ”
austen	persuasion	“ depend upon it , they were all perfectly comfortable. ” “ i might not like them the better for that perhaps . such a number of women and children have no _right_ to be comfortable on board . ”
austen	persuasion	“ my dear frederick , you are talking quite idly . pray , what would become of us poor sailors ’ wives , who often want to be conveyed to one port or another , after our husbands , if everybody had your feelings ? ”
austen	persuasion	“ my feelings , you see , did not prevent my taking mrs harville and all her family to plymouth. ” “ but i hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman , and as if women were all fine ladies , instead of rational creatures . we none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days . ”
austen	persuasion	“ ah ! my dear , ” said the admiral , “ when he had got a wife , he will sing a different tune . when he is married , if we have the good luck to live to another war , we shall see him do as you and i , and a great many others , have done . we shall have him very thankful to anybody that will bring him his wife . ”
austen	persuasion	“ ay , that we shall. ” “ now i have done , ” cried captain wentworth . “ when once married people begin to attack me with , — ‘ oh ! you will think very differently , when you are married. ’ i can only say , ‘ no , i shall not ; ’ and then they say again , ‘ yes , you will , ’ and there is an end of it . ”
austen	persuasion	he got up and moved away . “ what a great traveller you must have been , ma ’ am ! ” said mrs musgrove to mrs croft . “ pretty well , ma ’ am in the fifteen years of my marriage ; though many women have done more . i have crossed the atlantic four times , and have been once to the east indies , and back again , and only once ; besides being in different places about home : cork , and lisbon , and gibraltar . but i never went beyond the streights , and never was in the west indies . we do not call bermuda or bahama , you know , the west indies . ”
austen	persuasion	mrs musgrove had not a word to say in dissent ; she could not accuse herself of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life . “ and i do assure you , ma ’ am , ” pursued mrs croft , “ that nothing can exceed the accommodations of a man-of-war ; i speak , you know , of the higher rates . when you come to a frigate , of course , you are more confined ; though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them ; and i can safely say , that the happiest part of my life has been spent on board a ship . while we were together , you know , there was nothing to be feared . thank god ! i have always been blessed with excellent health , and no climate disagrees with me . a little disordered always the first twenty-four hours of going to sea , but never knew what sickness was afterwards . the only time i ever really suffered in body or mind , the only time that i ever fancied myself unwell , or had any ideas of danger , was the winter that i passed by myself at deal , when the admiral ( _captain_ croft then ) was in the north seas . i lived in perpetual fright at that time , and had all manner of imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself , or when i should hear from him next ; but as long as we could be together , nothing ever ailed me , and i never met with the smallest inconvenience . ”
austen	persuasion	“ aye , to be sure . yes , indeed , oh yes ! i am quite of your opinion , mrs croft , ” was mrs musgrove ’ s hearty answer . “ there is nothing so bad as a separation . i am quite of your opinion . _i_ know what it is , for mr musgrove always attends the assizes , and i am so glad when they are over , and he is safe back again . ”
austen	persuasion	the evening ended with dancing . on its being proposed , anne offered her services , as usual ; and though her eyes would sometimes fill with tears as she sat at the instrument , she was extremely glad to be employed , and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved .
austen	persuasion	it was a merry , joyous party , and no one seemed in higher spirits than captain wentworth . she felt that he had every thing to elevate him which general attention and deference , and especially the attention of all the young women , could do . the miss hayters , the females of the family of cousins already mentioned , were apparently admitted to the honour of being in love with him ; and as for henrietta and louisa , they both seemed so entirely occupied by him , that nothing but the continued appearance of the most perfect good-will between themselves could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals . if he were a little spoilt by such universal , such eager admiration , who could wonder ?
austen	persuasion	these were some of the thoughts which occupied anne , while her fingers were mechanically at work , proceeding for half an hour together , equally without error , and without consciousness . _once_ she felt that he was looking at herself , observing her altered features , perhaps , trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once charmed him ; and _once_ she knew that he must have spoken of her ; she was hardly aware of it , till she heard the answer ; but then she was sure of his having asked his partner whether miss elliot never danced ? the answer was , “ oh , no ; never ; she has quite given up dancing . she had rather play . she is never tired of playing. ” once , too , he spoke to her . she had left the instrument on the dancing being over , and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished to give the miss musgroves an idea of . unintentionally she returned to that part of the room ; he saw her , and , instantly rising , said , with studied politeness—
austen	persuasion	“ i beg your pardon , madam , this is your seat ; ” and though she immediately drew back with a decided negative , he was not to be induced to sit down again . anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches . his cold politeness , his ceremonious grace , were worse than anything .
austen	persuasion	chapter ix . captain wentworth was come to kellynch as to a home , to stay as long as he liked , being as thoroughly the object of the admiral ’ s fraternal kindness as of his wife ’ s . he had intended , on first arriving , to proceed very soon into shropshire , and visit the brother settled in that country , but the attractions of uppercross induced him to put this off . there was so much of friendliness , and of flattery , and of everything most bewitching in his reception there ; the old were so hospitable , the young so agreeable , that he could not but resolve to remain where he was , and take all the charms and perfections of edward ’ s wife upon credit a little longer .
austen	persuasion	it was soon uppercross with him almost every day . the musgroves could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come , particularly in the morning , when he had no companion at home , for the admiral and mrs croft were generally out of doors together , interesting themselves in their new possessions , their grass , and their sheep , and dawdling about in a way not endurable to a third person , or driving out in a gig , lately added to their establishment .
austen	persuasion	hitherto there had been but one opinion of captain wentworth among the musgroves and their dependencies . it was unvarying , warm admiration everywhere ; but this intimate footing was not more than established , when a certain charles hayter returned among them , to be a good deal disturbed by it , and to think captain wentworth very much in the way .
austen	persuasion	charles hayter was the eldest of all the cousins , and a very amiable , pleasing young man , between whom and henrietta there had been a considerable appearance of attachment previous to captain wentworth ’ s introduction . he was in orders ; and having a curacy in the neighbourhood , where residence was not required , lived at his father ’ s house , only two miles from uppercross . a short absence from home had left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period , and when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners , and of seeing captain wentworth .
austen	persuasion	mrs musgrove and mrs hayter were sisters . they had each had money , but their marriages had made a material difference in their degree of consequence . mr hayter had some property of his own , but it was insignificant compared with mr musgrove ’ s ; and while the musgroves were in the first class of society in the country , the young hayters would , from their parents ’ inferior , retired , and unpolished way of living , and their own defective education , have been hardly in any class at all , but for their connexion with uppercross , this eldest son of course excepted , who had chosen to be a scholar and a gentleman , and who was very superior in cultivation and manners to all the rest .
austen	persuasion	the two families had always been on excellent terms , there being no pride on one side , and no envy on the other , and only such a consciousness of superiority in the miss musgroves , as made them pleased to improve their cousins . charles ’ s attentions to henrietta had been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation . “ it would not be a great match for her ; but if henrietta liked him , ” —and henrietta _did_ seem to like him .
austen	persuasion	henrietta fully thought so herself , before captain wentworth came ; but from that time cousin charles had been very much forgotten . which of the two sisters was preferred by captain wentworth was as yet quite doubtful , as far as anne ’ s observation reached . henrietta was perhaps the prettiest , louisa had the higher spirits ; and she knew not _now_ , whether the more gentle or the more lively character were most likely to attract him .
austen	persuasion	mr and mrs musgrove , either from seeing little , or from an entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters , and of all the young men who came near them , seemed to leave everything to take its chance . there was not the smallest appearance of solicitude or remark about them in the mansion-house ; but it was different at the cottage : the young couple there were more disposed to speculate and wonder ; and captain wentworth had not been above four or five times in the miss musgroves ’ company , and charles hayter had but just reappeared , when anne had to listen to the opinions of her brother and sister , as to _which_ was the one liked best . charles gave it for louisa , mary for henrietta , but quite agreeing that to have him marry either could be extremely delightful .
austen	persuasion	charles “ had never seen a pleasanter man in his life ; and from what he had once heard captain wentworth himself say , was very sure that he had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war . here was a fortune at once ; besides which , there would be the chance of what might be done in any future war ; and he was sure captain wentworth was as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy . oh ! it would be a capital match for either of his sisters . ”
austen	persuasion	“ upon my word it would , ” replied mary . “ dear me ! if he should rise to any very great honours ! if he should ever be made a baronet ! ‘ lady wentworth ’ sounds very well . that would be a noble thing , indeed , for henrietta ! she would take place of me then , and henrietta would not dislike that . sir frederick and lady wentworth ! it would be but a new creation , however , and i never think much of your new creations . ”
austen	persuasion	it suited mary best to think henrietta the one preferred on the very account of charles hayter , whose pretensions she wished to see put an end to . she looked down very decidedly upon the hayters , and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection between the families renewed—very sad for herself and her children .
austen	persuasion	“ you know , ” said she , “ i can not think him at all a fit match for henrietta ; and considering the alliances which the musgroves have made , she has no right to throw herself away . i do not think any young woman has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient to the _principal_ part of her family , and be giving bad connections to those who have not been used to them . and , pray , who is charles hayter ? nothing but a country curate . a most improper match for miss musgrove of uppercross . ”
austen	persuasion	her husband , however , would not agree with her here ; for besides having a regard for his cousin , charles hayter was an eldest son , and he saw things as an eldest son himself .
austen	persuasion	“ now you are talking nonsense , mary , ” was therefore his answer . “ it would not be a _great_ match for henrietta , but charles has a very fair chance , through the spicers , of getting something from the bishop in the course of a year or two ; and you will please to remember , that he is the eldest son ; whenever my uncle dies , he steps into very pretty property . the estate at winthrop is not less than two hundred and fifty acres , besides the farm near taunton , which is some of the best land in the country . i grant you , that any of them but charles would be a very shocking match for henrietta , and indeed it could not be ; he is the only one that could be possible ; but he is a very good-natured , good sort of a fellow ; and whenever winthrop comes into his hands , he will make a different sort of place of it , and live in a very different sort of way ; and with that property , he will never be a contemptible man—good , freehold property . no , no ; henrietta might do worse than marry charles hayter ; and if she has him , and louisa can get captain wentworth , i shall be very well satisfied . ”
austen	persuasion	“ charles may say what he pleases , ” cried mary to anne , as soon as he was out of the room , “ but it would be shocking to have henrietta marry charles hayter ; a very bad thing for _her_ , and still worse for _me ; _ and therefore it is very much to be wished that captain wentworth may soon put him quite out of her head , and i have very little doubt that he has . she took hardly any notice of charles hayter yesterday . i wish you had been there to see her behaviour . and as to captain wentworth ’ s liking louisa as well as henrietta , it is nonsense to say so ; for he certainly _does_ like henrietta a great deal the best . but charles is so positive ! i wish you had been with us yesterday , for then you might have decided between us ; and i am sure you would have thought as i did , unless you had been determined to give it against me . ”
austen	persuasion	a dinner at mr musgrove ’ s had been the occasion when all these things should have been seen by anne ; but she had staid at home , under the mixed plea of a headache of her own , and some return of indisposition in little charles . she had thought only of avoiding captain wentworth ; but an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening .
austen	persuasion	as to captain wentworth ’ s views , she deemed it of more consequence that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering the happiness of either sister , or impeaching his own honour , than that he should prefer henrietta to louisa , or louisa to henrietta . either of them would , in all probability , make him an affectionate , good-humoured wife . with regard to charles hayter , she had delicacy which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning young woman , and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned ; but if henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings , the alteration could not be understood too soon .
austen	persuasion	charles hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him in his cousin ’ s behaviour . she had too old a regard for him to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope , and leave him nothing to do but to keep away from uppercross : but there was such a change as became very alarming , when such a man as captain wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause . he had been absent only two sundays , and when they parted , had left her interested , even to the height of his wishes , in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy , and obtaining that of uppercross instead . it had then seemed the object nearest her heart , that dr shirley , the rector , who for more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office , but was now growing too infirm for many of them , should be quite fixed on engaging a curate ; should make his curacy quite as good as he could afford , and should give charles hayter the promise of it . the advantage of his having to come only to uppercross , instead of going six miles another way ; of his having , in every respect , a better curacy ; of his belonging to their dear dr shirley , and of dear , good dr shirley ’ s being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through without most injurious fatigue , had been a great deal , even to louisa , but had been almost everything to henrietta . when he came back , alas ! the zeal of the business was gone by . louisa could not listen at all to his account of a conversation which he had just held with dr shirley : she was at a window , looking out for captain wentworth ; and even henrietta had at best only a divided attention to give , and seemed to have forgotten all the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation .
austen	persuasion	“ well , i am very glad indeed : but i always thought you would have it ; i always thought you sure . it did not appear to me that—in short , you know , dr shirley _must_ have a curate , and you had secured his promise . is he coming , louisa ? ”
austen	persuasion	one morning , very soon after the dinner at the musgroves , at which anne had not been present , captain wentworth walked into the drawing-room at the cottage , where were only herself and the little invalid charles , who was lying on the sofa .
austen	persuasion	the surprise of finding himself almost alone with anne elliot , deprived his manners of their usual composure : he started , and could only say , “ i thought the miss musgroves had been here : mrs musgrove told me i should find them here , ” before he walked to the window to recollect himself , and feel how he ought to behave .
austen	persuasion	“ they are up stairs with my sister : they will be down in a few moments , i dare say , ” had been anne ’ s reply , in all the confusion that was natural ; and if the child had not called her to come and do something for him , she would have been out of the room the next moment , and released captain wentworth as well as herself .
austen	persuasion	he continued at the window ; and after calmly and politely saying , “ i hope the little boy is better , ” was silent . she was obliged to kneel down by the sofa , and remain there to satisfy her patient ; and thus they continued a few minutes , when , to her very great satisfaction , she heard some other person crossing the little vestibule . she hoped , on turning her head , to see the master of the house ; but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters easy—charles hayter , probably not at all better pleased by the sight of captain wentworth than captain wentworth had been by the sight of anne .
austen	persuasion	she only attempted to say , “ how do you do ? will you not sit down ? the others will be here presently. ” captain wentworth , however , came from his window , apparently not ill-disposed for conversation ; but charles hayter soon put an end to his attempts by seating himself near the table , and taking up the newspaper ; and captain wentworth returned to his window .
austen	persuasion	another minute brought another addition . the younger boy , a remarkable stout , forward child , of two years old , having got the door opened for him by some one without , made his determined appearance among them , and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on , and put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away .
austen	persuasion	there being nothing to eat , he could only have some play ; and as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother , he began to fasten himself upon her , as she knelt , in such a way that , busy as she was about charles , she could not shake him off . she spoke to him , ordered , entreated , and insisted in vain . once she did contrive to push him away , but the boy had the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly .
austen	persuasion	“ walter , ” said she , “ get down this moment . you are extremely troublesome . i am very angry with you. ” “ walter , ” cried charles hayter , “ why do you not do as you are bid ? do not you hear your aunt speak ? come to me , walter , come to cousin charles . ”
austen	persuasion	but not a bit did walter stir . in another moment , however , she found herself in the state of being released from him ; some one was taking him from her , though he had bent down her head so much , that his little sturdy hands were unfastened from around her neck , and he was resolutely borne away , before she knew that captain wentworth had done it .
austen	persuasion	her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless . she could not even thank him . she could only hang over little charles , with most disordered feelings . his kindness in stepping forward to her relief , the manner , the silence in which it had passed , the little particulars of the circumstance , with the conviction soon forced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child , that he meant to avoid hearing her thanks , and rather sought to testify that her conversation was the last of his wants , produced such a confusion of varying , but very painful agitation , as she could not recover from , till enabled by the entrance of mary and the miss musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares , and leave the room . she could not stay . it might have been an opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four—they were now altogether ; but she could stay for none of it . it was evident that charles hayter was not well inclined towards captain wentworth . she had a strong impression of his having said , in a vext tone of voice , after captain wentworth ’ s interference , “ you ought to have minded _me_ , walter ; i told you not to teaze your aunt ; ” and could comprehend his regretting that captain wentworth should do what he ought to have done himself . but neither charles hayter ’ s feelings , nor anybody ’ s feelings , could interest her , till she had a little better arranged her own . she was ashamed of herself , quite ashamed of being so nervous , so overcome by such a trifle ; but so it was , and it required a long application of solitude and reflection to recover her .
austen	persuasion	chapter x . other opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur . anne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough to have an opinion , though too wise to acknowledge as much at home , where she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife ; for while she considered louisa to be rather the favourite , she could not but think , as far as she might dare to judge from memory and experience , that captain wentworth was not in love with either . they were more in love with him ; yet there it was not love . it was a little fever of admiration ; but it might , probably must , end in love with some . charles hayter seemed aware of being slighted , and yet henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them . anne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about , and of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to . she did not attribute guile to any . it was the highest satisfaction to her to believe captain wentworth not in the least aware of the pain he was occasioning . there was no triumph , no pitiful triumph in his manner . he had , probably , never heard , and never thought of any claims of charles hayter . he was only wrong in accepting the attentions ( for accepting must be the word ) of two young women at once .
austen	persuasion	after a short struggle , however , charles hayter seemed to quit the field . three days had passed without his coming once to uppercross ; a most decided change . he had even refused one regular invitation to dinner ; and having been found on the occasion by mr musgrove with some large books before him , mr and mrs musgrove were sure all could not be right , and talked , with grave faces , of his studying himself to death . it was mary ’ s hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal from henrietta , and her husband lived under the constant dependence of seeing him to-morrow . anne could only feel that charles hayter was wise .
austen	persuasion	one morning , about this time charles musgrove and captain wentworth being gone a-shooting together , as the sisters in the cottage were sitting quietly at work , they were visited at the window by the sisters from the mansion-house .
austen	persuasion	it was a very fine november day , and the miss musgroves came through the little grounds , and stopped for no other purpose than to say , that they were going to take a _long_ walk , and , therefore , concluded mary could not like to go with them ; and when mary immediately replied , with some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker , “ oh , yes , i should like to join you very much , i am very fond of a long walk ; ” anne felt persuaded , by the looks of the two girls , that it was precisely what they did not wish , and admired again the sort of necessity which the family habits seemed to produce , of everything being to be communicated , and everything being to be done together , however undesired and inconvenient . she tried to dissuade mary from going , but in vain ; and that being the case , thought it best to accept the miss musgroves ’ much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise , as she might be useful in turning back with her sister , and lessening the interference in any plan of their own .
austen	persuasion	“ i can not imagine why they should suppose i should not like a long walk , ” said mary , as she went up stairs . “ everybody is always supposing that i am not a good walker ; and yet they would not have been pleased , if we had refused to join them . when people come in this manner on purpose to ask us , how can one say no ? ”
austen	persuasion	just as they were setting off , the gentlemen returned . they had taken out a young dog , who had spoilt their sport , and sent them back early . their time and strength , and spirits , were , therefore , exactly ready for this walk , and they entered into it with pleasure . could anne have foreseen such a junction , she would have staid at home ; but , from some feelings of interest and curiosity , she fancied now that it was too late to retract , and the whole six set forward together in the direction chosen by the miss musgroves , who evidently considered the walk as under their guidance .
austen	persuasion	anne ’ s object was , not to be in the way of anybody ; and where the narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary , to keep with her brother and sister . her _pleasure_ in the walk must arise from the exercise and the day , from the view of the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves , and withered hedges , and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical descriptions extant of autumn , that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness , that season which had drawn from every poet , worthy of being read , some attempt at description , or some lines of feeling . she occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings and quotations ; but it was not possible , that when within reach of captain wentworth ’ s conversation with either of the miss musgroves , she should not try to hear it ; yet she caught little very remarkable . it was mere lively chat , such as any young persons , on an intimate footing , might fall into . he was more engaged with louisa than with henrietta . louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister . this distinction appeared to increase , and there was one speech of louisa ’ s which struck her . after one of the many praises of the day , which were continually bursting forth , captain wentworth added : —
austen	persuasion	“ what glorious weather for the admiral and my sister ! they meant to take a long drive this morning ; perhaps we may hail them from some of these hills . they talked of coming into this side of the country . i wonder whereabouts they will upset to-day . oh ! it does happen very often , i assure you ; but my sister makes nothing of it ; she would as lieve be tossed out as not . ”
austen	persuasion	“ ah ! you make the most of it , i know , ” cried louisa , “ but if it were really so , i should do just the same in her place . if i loved a man , as she loves the admiral , i would always be with him , nothing should ever separate us , and i would rather be overturned by him , than driven safely by anybody else . ”
austen	persuasion	it was spoken with enthusiasm . “ had you ? ” cried he , catching the same tone ; “ i honour you ! ” and there was silence between them for a little while . anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again . the sweet scenes of autumn were for a while put by , unless some tender sonnet , fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year , with declining happiness , and the images of youth and hope , and spring , all gone together , blessed her memory . she roused herself to say , as they struck by order into another path , “ is not this one of the ways to winthrop ? ” but nobody heard , or , at least , nobody answered her .
austen	persuasion	winthrop , however , or its environs—for young men are , sometimes to be met with , strolling about near home—was their destination ; and after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures , where the ploughs at work , and the fresh made path spoke the farmer counteracting the sweets of poetical despondence , and meaning to have spring again , they gained the summit of the most considerable hill , which parted uppercross and winthrop , and soon commanded a full view of the latter , at the foot of the hill on the other side .
austen	persuasion	winthrop , without beauty and without dignity , was stretched before them ; an indifferent house , standing low , and hemmed in by the barns and buildings of a farm-yard . mary exclaimed , “ bless me ! here is winthrop . i declare i had no idea ! well now , i think we had better turn back ; i am excessively tired . ”
austen	persuasion	henrietta , conscious and ashamed , and seeing no cousin charles walking along any path , or leaning against any gate , was ready to do as mary wished ; but “ no ! ” said charles musgrove , and “ no , no ! ” cried louisa more eagerly , and taking her sister aside , seemed to be arguing the matter warmly .
austen	persuasion	charles , in the meanwhile , was very decidedly declaring his resolution of calling on his aunt , now that he was so near ; and very evidently , though more fearfully , trying to induce his wife to go too . but this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength ; and when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter of an hour at winthrop , as she felt so tired , she resolutely answered , “ oh ! no , indeed ! walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any sitting down could do her good ; ” and , in short , her look and manner declared , that go she would not .
austen	persuasion	after a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations , it was settled between charles and his two sisters , that he and henrietta should just run down for a few minutes , to see their aunt and cousins , while the rest of the party waited for them at the top of the hill . louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan ; and , as she went a little way with them , down the hill , still talking to henrietta , mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her , and saying to captain wentworth—
austen	persuasion	“ it is very unpleasant , having such connexions ! but , i assure you , i have never been in the house above twice in my life. ” she received no other answer , than an artificial , assenting smile , followed by a contemptuous glance , as he turned away , which anne perfectly knew the meaning of .
austen	persuasion	the brow of the hill , where they remained , was a cheerful spot : louisa returned ; and mary , finding a comfortable seat for herself on the step of a stile , was very well satisfied so long as the others all stood about her ; but when louisa drew captain wentworth away , to try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge-row , and they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound , mary was happy no longer ; she quarrelled with her own seat , was sure louisa had got a much better somewhere , and nothing could prevent her from going to look for a better also . she turned through the same gate , but could not see them . anne found a nice seat for her , on a dry sunny bank , under the hedge-row , in which she had no doubt of their still being , in some spot or other . mary sat down for a moment , but it would not do ; she was sure louisa had found a better seat somewhere else , and she would go on till she overtook her .
austen	persuasion	anne , really tired herself , was glad to sit down ; and she very soon heard captain wentworth and louisa in the hedge-row , behind her , as if making their way back along the rough , wild sort of channel , down the centre . they were speaking as they drew near . louisa ’ s voice was the first distinguished . she seemed to be in the middle of some eager speech . what anne first heard was—
austen	persuasion	“ and so , i made her go . i could not bear that she should be frightened from the visit by such nonsense . what ! would i be turned back from doing a thing that i had determined to do , and that i knew to be right , by the airs and interference of such a person , or of any person i may say ? no , i have no idea of being so easily persuaded . when i have made up my mind , i have made it ; and henrietta seemed entirely to have made up hers to call at winthrop to-day ; and yet , she was as near giving it up , out of nonsensical complaisance ! ”
austen	persuasion	“ she would have turned back then , but for you ? ” “ she would indeed . i am almost ashamed to say it. ” “ happy for her , to have such a mind as yours at hand ! after the hints you gave just now , which did but confirm my own observations , the last time i was in company with him , i need not affect to have no comprehension of what is going on . i see that more than a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question ; and woe betide him , and her too , when it comes to things of consequence , when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind , if she have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this . your sister is an amiable creature ; but _yours_ is the character of decision and firmness , i see . if you value her conduct or happiness , infuse as much of your own spirit into her as you can . but this , no doubt , you have been always doing . it is the worst evil of too yielding and indecisive a character , that no influence over it can be depended on . you are never sure of a good impression being durable ; everybody may sway it . let those who would be happy be firm . here is a nut , ” said he , catching one down from an upper bough , “ to exemplify : a beautiful glossy nut , which , blessed with original strength , has outlived all the storms of autumn . not a puncture , not a weak spot anywhere . this nut , ” he continued , with playful solemnity , “ while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot , is still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be supposed capable of. ” then returning to his former earnest tone— “ my first wish for all whom i am interested in , is that they should be firm . if louisa musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her november of life , she will cherish all her present powers of mind . ”
austen	persuasion	he had done , and was unanswered . it would have surprised anne if louisa could have readily answered such a speech : words of such interest , spoken with such serious warmth ! she could imagine what louisa was feeling . for herself , she feared to move , lest she should be seen . while she remained , a bush of low rambling holly protected her , and they were moving on . before they were beyond her hearing , however , louisa spoke again .
austen	persuasion	“ mary is good-natured enough in many respects , ” said she ; “ but she does sometimes provoke me excessively , by her nonsense and pride—the elliot pride . she has a great deal too much of the elliot pride . we do so wish that charles had married anne instead . i suppose you know he wanted to marry anne ? ”
austen	persuasion	after a moment ’ s pause , captain wentworth said— “ do you mean that she refused him ? ” “ oh ! yes ; certainly. ” “ when did that happen ? ” “ i do not exactly know , for henrietta and i were at school at the time ; but i believe about a year before he married mary . i wish she had accepted him . we should all have liked her a great deal better ; and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend lady russell ’ s doing , that she did not . they think charles might not be learned and bookish enough to please lady russell , and that therefore , she persuaded anne to refuse him . ”
austen	persuasion	the sounds were retreating , and anne distinguished no more . her own emotions still kept her fixed . she had much to recover from , before she could move . the listener ’ s proverbial fate was not absolutely hers ; she had heard no evil of herself , but she had heard a great deal of very painful import . she saw how her own character was considered by captain wentworth , and there had been just that degree of feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her extreme agitation .
austen	persuasion	as soon as she could , she went after mary , and having found , and walked back with her to their former station , by the stile , felt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards collected , and once more in motion together . her spirits wanted the solitude and silence which only numbers could give .
austen	persuasion	charles and henrietta returned , bringing , as may be conjectured , charles hayter with them . the minutiae of the business anne could not attempt to understand ; even captain wentworth did not seem admitted to perfect confidence here ; but that there had been a withdrawing on the gentleman ’ s side , and a relenting on the lady ’ s , and that they were now very glad to be together again , did not admit a doubt . henrietta looked a little ashamed , but very well pleased ; —charles hayter exceedingly happy : and they were devoted to each other almost from the first instant of their all setting forward for uppercross .
austen	persuasion	everything now marked out louisa for captain wentworth ; nothing could be plainer ; and where many divisions were necessary , or even where they were not , they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two . in a long strip of meadow land , where there was ample space for all , they were thus divided , forming three distinct parties ; and to that party of the three which boasted least animation , and least complaisance , anne necessarily belonged . she joined charles and mary , and was tired enough to be very glad of charles ’ s other arm ; but charles , though in very good humour with her , was out of temper with his wife . mary had shewn herself disobliging to him , and was now to reap the consequence , which consequence was his dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads of some nettles in the hedge with his switch ; and when mary began to complain of it , and lament her being ill-used , according to custom , in being on the hedge side , while anne was never incommoded on the other , he dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had a momentary glance of , and they could hardly get him along at all .
austen	persuasion	this long meadow bordered a lane , which their footpath , at the end of it was to cross , and when the party had all reached the gate of exit , the carriage advancing in the same direction , which had been some time heard , was just coming up , and proved to be admiral croft ’ s gig . he and his wife had taken their intended drive , and were returning home . upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in , they kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired ; it would save her a full mile , and they were going through uppercross . the invitation was general , and generally declined . the miss musgroves were not at all tired , and mary was either offended , by not being asked before any of the others , or what louisa called the elliot pride could not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise .
austen	persuasion	the walking party had crossed the lane , and were surmounting an opposite stile , and the admiral was putting his horse in motion again , when captain wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something to his sister . the something might be guessed by its effects .
austen	persuasion	“ miss elliot , i am sure _you_ are tired , ” cried mrs croft . “ do let us have the pleasure of taking you home . here is excellent room for three , i assure you . if we were all like you , i believe we might sit four . you must , indeed , you must . ”
austen	persuasion	anne was still in the lane ; and though instinctively beginning to decline , she was not allowed to proceed . the admiral ’ s kind urgency came in support of his wife ’ s ; they would not be refused ; they compressed themselves into the smallest possible space to leave her a corner , and captain wentworth , without saying a word , turned to her , and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage .
austen	persuasion	yes ; he had done it . she was in the carriage , and felt that he had placed her there , that his will and his hands had done it , that she owed it to his perception of her fatigue , and his resolution to give her rest . she was very much affected by the view of his disposition towards her , which all these things made apparent . this little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before . she understood him . he could not forgive her , but he could not be unfeeling . though condemning her for the past , and considering it with high and unjust resentment , though perfectly careless of her , and though becoming attached to another , still he could not see her suffer , without the desire of giving her relief . it was a remainder of former sentiment ; it was an impulse of pure , though unacknowledged friendship ; it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart , which she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded of pleasure and pain , that she knew not which prevailed .
austen	persuasion	her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions were at first unconsciously given . they had travelled half their way along the rough lane , before she was quite awake to what they said . she then found them talking of “ frederick . ”
austen	persuasion	“ he certainly means to have one or other of those two girls , sophy , ” said the admiral ; “ but there is no saying which . he has been running after them , too , long enough , one would think , to make up his mind . ay , this comes of the peace . if it were war now , he would have settled it long ago . we sailors , miss elliot , can not afford to make long courtships in time of war . how many days was it , my dear , between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our lodgings at north yarmouth ? ”
austen	persuasion	“ we had better not talk about it , my dear , ” replied mrs croft , pleasantly ; “ for if miss elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding , she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together . i had known you by character , however , long before . ”
austen	persuasion	“ well , and i had heard of you as a very pretty girl , and what were we to wait for besides ? i do not like having such things so long in hand . i wish frederick would spread a little more canvass , and bring us home one of these young ladies to kellynch . then there would always be company for them . and very nice young ladies they both are ; i hardly know one from the other . ”
austen	persuasion	“ very good humoured , unaffected girls , indeed , ” said mrs croft , in a tone of calmer praise , such as made anne suspect that her keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy of her brother ; “ and a very respectable family . one could not be connected with better people . my dear admiral , that post ! we shall certainly take that post . ”
austen	persuasion	but by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily passed the danger ; and by once afterwards judiciously putting out her hand they neither fell into a rut , nor ran foul of a dung-cart ; and anne , with some amusement at their style of driving , which she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance of their affairs , found herself safely deposited by them at the cottage .
austen	persuasion	chapter xi . the time now approached for lady russell ’ s return : the day was even fixed ; and anne , being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled , was looking forward to an early removal to kellynch , and beginning to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it .
austen	persuasion	it would place her in the same village with captain wentworth , within half a mile of him ; they would have to frequent the same church , and there must be intercourse between the two families . this was against her ; but on the other hand , he spent so much of his time at uppercross , that in removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving him behind , than as going towards him ; and , upon the whole , she believed she must , on this interesting question , be the gainer , almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society , in leaving poor mary for lady russell .
austen	persuasion	she wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing captain wentworth at the hall : those rooms had witnessed former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her ; but she was yet more anxious for the possibility of lady russell and captain wentworth never meeting anywhere . they did not like each other , and no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good ; and were lady russell to see them together , she might think that he had too much self-possession , and she too little .
austen	persuasion	these points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating her removal from uppercross , where she felt she had been stationed quite long enough . her usefulness to little charles would always give some sweetness to the memory of her two months ’ visit there , but he was gaining strength apace , and she had nothing else to stay for .
austen	persuasion	the conclusion of her visit , however , was diversified in a way which she had not at all imagined . captain wentworth , after being unseen and unheard of at uppercross for two whole days , appeared again among them to justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away .
austen	persuasion	a letter from his friend , captain harville , having found him out at last , had brought intelligence of captain harville ’ s being settled with his family at lyme for the winter ; of their being therefore , quite unknowingly , within twenty miles of each other . captain harville had never been in good health since a severe wound which he received two years before , and captain wentworth ’ s anxiety to see him had determined him to go immediately to lyme . he had been there for four-and-twenty hours . his acquittal was complete , his friendship warmly honoured , a lively interest excited for his friend , and his description of the fine country about lyme so feelingly attended to by the party , that an earnest desire to see lyme themselves , and a project for going thither was the consequence .
austen	persuasion	the young people were all wild to see lyme . captain wentworth talked of going there again himself , it was only seventeen miles from uppercross ; though november , the weather was by no means bad ; and , in short , louisa , who was the most eager of the eager , having formed the resolution to go , and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked , being now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way , bore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off till summer ; and to lyme they were to go—charles , mary , anne , henrietta , louisa , and captain wentworth .
austen	persuasion	the first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night ; but to this mr musgrove , for the sake of his horses , would not consent ; and when it came to be rationally considered , a day in the middle of november would not leave much time for seeing a new place , after deducting seven hours , as the nature of the country required , for going and returning . they were , consequently , to stay the night there , and not to be expected back till the next day ’ s dinner . this was felt to be a considerable amendment ; and though they all met at the great house at rather an early breakfast hour , and set off very punctually , it was so much past noon before the two carriages , mr musgrove ’ s coach containing the four ladies , and charles ’ s curricle , in which he drove captain wentworth , were descending the long hill into lyme , and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself , that it was very evident they would not have more than time for looking about them , before the light and warmth of the day were gone .
austen	persuasion	after securing accommodations , and ordering a dinner at one of the inns , the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly down to the sea . they were come too late in the year for any amusement or variety which lyme , as a public place , might offer . the rooms were shut up , the lodgers almost all gone , scarcely any family but of the residents left ; and , as there is nothing to admire in the buildings themselves , the remarkable situation of the town , the principal street almost hurrying into the water , the walk to the cobb , skirting round the pleasant little bay , which , in the season , is animated with bathing machines and company ; the cobb itself , its old wonders and new improvements , with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town , are what the stranger ’ s eye will seek ; and a very strange stranger it must be , who does not see charms in the immediate environs of lyme , to make him wish to know it better . the scenes in its neighbourhood , charmouth , with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country , and still more , its sweet , retired bay , backed by dark cliffs , where fragments of low rock among the sands , make it the happiest spot for watching the flow of the tide , for sitting in unwearied contemplation ; the woody varieties of the cheerful village of up lyme ; and , above all , pinny , with its green chasms between romantic rocks , where the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth , declare that many a generation must have passed away since the first partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state , where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited , as may more than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far-famed isle of wight : these places must be visited , and visited again , to make the worth of lyme understood .
austen	persuasion	the party from uppercross passing down by the now deserted and melancholy looking rooms , and still descending , soon found themselves on the sea-shore ; and lingering only , as all must linger and gaze on a first return to the sea , who ever deserved to look on it at all , proceeded towards the cobb , equally their object in itself and on captain wentworth ’ s account : for in a small house , near the foot of an old pier of unknown date , were the harvilles settled . captain wentworth turned in to call on his friend ; the others walked on , and he was to join them on the cobb .
austen	persuasion	they were by no means tired of wondering and admiring ; and not even louisa seemed to feel that they had parted with captain wentworth long , when they saw him coming after them , with three companions , all well known already , by description , to be captain and mrs harville , and a captain benwick , who was staying with them .
austen	persuasion	captain benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the laconia ; and the account which captain wentworth had given of him , on his return from lyme before , his warm praise of him as an excellent young man and an officer , whom he had always valued highly , which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener , had been followed by a little history of his private life , which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies . he had been engaged to captain harville ’ s sister , and was now mourning her loss . they had been a year or two waiting for fortune and promotion . fortune came , his prize-money as lieutenant being great ; promotion , too , came at _last ; _ but fanny harville did not live to know it . she had died the preceding summer while he was at sea . captain wentworth believed it impossible for man to be more attached to woman than poor benwick had been to fanny harville , or to be more deeply afflicted under the dreadful change . he considered his disposition as of the sort which must suffer heavily , uniting very strong feelings with quiet , serious , and retiring manners , and a decided taste for reading , and sedentary pursuits . to finish the interest of the story , the friendship between him and the harvilles seemed , if possible , augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance , and captain benwick was now living with them entirely . captain harville had taken his present house for half a year ; his taste , and his health , and his fortune , all directing him to a residence inexpensive , and by the sea ; and the grandeur of the country , and the retirement of lyme in the winter , appeared exactly adapted to captain benwick ’ s state of mind . the sympathy and good-will excited towards captain benwick was very great .
austen	persuasion	“ and yet , ” said anne to herself , as they now moved forward to meet the party , “ he has not , perhaps , a more sorrowing heart than i have . i can not believe his prospects so blighted for ever . he is younger than i am ; younger in feeling , if not in fact ; younger as a man . he will rally again , and be happy with another . ”
austen	persuasion	they all met , and were introduced . captain harville was a tall , dark man , with a sensible , benevolent countenance ; a little lame ; and from strong features and want of health , looking much older than captain wentworth . captain benwick looked , and was , the youngest of the three , and , compared with either of them , a little man . he had a pleasing face and a melancholy air , just as he ought to have , and drew back from conversation .
austen	persuasion	captain harville , though not equalling captain wentworth in manners , was a perfect gentleman , unaffected , warm , and obliging . mrs harville , a degree less polished than her husband , seemed , however , to have the same good feelings ; and nothing could be more pleasant than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own , because the friends of captain wentworth , or more kindly hospitable than their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them . the dinner , already ordered at the inn , was at last , though unwillingly , accepted as a excuse ; but they seemed almost hurt that captain wentworth should have brought any such party to lyme , without considering it as a thing of course that they should dine with them .
austen	persuasion	there was so much attachment to captain wentworth in all this , and such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon , so unlike the usual style of give-and-take invitations , and dinners of formality and display , that anne felt her spirits not likely to be benefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother-officers . “ these would have been all my friends , ” was her thought ; and she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness .
austen	persuasion	on quitting the cobb , they all went in-doors with their new friends , and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart could think capable of accommodating so many . anne had a moment ’ s astonishment on the subject herself ; but it was soon lost in the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all the ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of captain harville , to turn the actual space to the best account , to supply the deficiencies of lodging-house furniture , and defend the windows and doors against the winter storms to be expected . the varieties in the fitting-up of the rooms , where the common necessaries provided by the owner , in the common indifferent plight , were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood , excellently worked up , and with something curious and valuable from all the distant countries captain harville had visited , were more than amusing to anne ; connected as it all was with his profession , the fruit of its labours , the effect of its influence on his habits , the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented , made it to her a something more , or less , than gratification .
austen	persuasion	captain harville was no reader ; but he had contrived excellent accommodations , and fashioned very pretty shelves , for a tolerable collection of well-bound volumes , the property of captain benwick . his lameness prevented him from taking much exercise ; but a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with constant employment within . he drew , he varnished , he carpentered , he glued ; he made toys for the children ; he fashioned new netting-needles and pins with improvements ; and if everything else was done , sat down to his large fishing-net at one corner of the room .
austen	persuasion	anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they quitted the house ; and louisa , by whom she found herself walking , burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character of the navy ; their friendliness , their brotherliness , their openness , their uprightness ; protesting that she was convinced of sailors having more worth and warmth than any other set of men in england ; that they only knew how to live , and they only deserved to be respected and loved .
austen	persuasion	they went back to dress and dine ; and so well had the scheme answered already , that nothing was found amiss ; though its being “ so entirely out of season , ” and the “ no thoroughfare of lyme , ” and the “ no expectation of company , ” had brought many apologies from the heads of the inn .
austen	persuasion	anne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened to being in captain wentworth ’ s company than she had at first imagined could ever be , that the sitting down to the same table with him now , and the interchange of the common civilities attending on it ( they never got beyond ) , was become a mere nothing .
austen	persuasion	the nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow , but captain harville had promised them a visit in the evening ; and he came , bringing his friend also , which was more than had been expected , it having been agreed that captain benwick had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of so many strangers . he ventured among them again , however , though his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth of the party in general .
austen	persuasion	while captains wentworth and harville led the talk on one side of the room , and by recurring to former days , supplied anecdotes in abundance to occupy and entertain the others , it fell to anne ’ s lot to be placed rather apart with captain benwick ; and a very good impulse of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him . he was shy , and disposed to abstraction ; but the engaging mildness of her countenance , and gentleness of her manners , soon had their effect ; and anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion . he was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading , though principally in poetry ; and besides the persuasion of having given him at least an evening ’ s indulgence in the discussion of subjects , which his usual companions had probably no concern in , she had the hope of being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and benefit of struggling against affliction , which had naturally grown out of their conversation . for , though shy , he did not seem reserved ; it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual restraints ; and having talked of poetry , the richness of the present age , and gone through a brief comparison of opinion as to the first-rate poets , trying to ascertain whether _marmion_ or _the lady of the lake_ were to be preferred , and how ranked the _giaour_ and _the bride of abydos ; _ and moreover , how the _giaour_ was to be pronounced , he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet , and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other ; he repeated , with such tremulous feeling , the various lines which imaged a broken heart , or a mind destroyed by wretchedness , and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood , that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry , and to say , that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely ; and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly .
austen	persuasion	his looks shewing him not pained , but pleased with this allusion to his situation , she was emboldened to go on ; and feeling in herself the right of seniority of mind , she ventured to recommend a larger allowance of prose in his daily study ; and on being requested to particularize , mentioned such works of our best moralists , such collections of the finest letters , such memoirs of characters of worth and suffering , as occurred to her at the moment as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts , and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances .
austen	persuasion	captain benwick listened attentively , and seemed grateful for the interest implied ; and though with a shake of the head , and sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books on grief like his , noted down the names of those she recommended , and promised to procure and read them .
austen	persuasion	when the evening was over , anne could not but be amused at the idea of her coming to lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man whom she had never seen before ; nor could she help fearing , on more serious reflection , that , like many other great moralists and preachers , she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct would ill bear examination .
austen	persuasion	chapter xii . anne and henrietta , finding themselves the earliest of the party the next morning , agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast . they went to the sands , to watch the flowing of the tide , which a fine south-easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur which so flat a shore admitted . they praised the morning ; gloried in the sea ; sympathized in the delight of the fresh-feeling breeze—and were silent ; till henrietta suddenly began again with—
austen	persuasion	“ oh ! yes , —i am quite convinced that , with very few exceptions , the sea-air always does good . there can be no doubt of its having been of the greatest service to dr shirley , after his illness , last spring twelve-month . he declares himself , that coming to lyme for a month , did him more good than all the medicine he took ; and , that being by the sea , always makes him feel young again . now , i can not help thinking it a pity that he does not live entirely by the sea . i do think he had better leave uppercross entirely , and fix at lyme . do not you , anne ? do not you agree with me , that it is the best thing he could do , both for himself and mrs shirley ? she has cousins here , you know , and many acquaintance , which would make it cheerful for her , and i am sure she would be glad to get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand , in case of his having another seizure . indeed i think it quite melancholy to have such excellent people as dr and mrs shirley , who have been doing good all their lives , wearing out their last days in a place like uppercross , where , excepting our family , they seem shut out from all the world . i wish his friends would propose it to him . i really think they ought . and , as to procuring a dispensation , there could be no difficulty at his time of life , and with his character . my only doubt is , whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish . he is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions ; over-scrupulous i must say . do not you think , anne , it is being over-scrupulous ? do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience , when a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties , which may be just as well performed by another person ? and at lyme too , only seventeen miles off , he would be near enough to hear , if people thought there was anything to complain of . ”
austen	persuasion	anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech , and entered into the subject , as ready to do good by entering into the feelings of a young lady as of a young man , though here it was good of a lower standard , for what could be offered but general acquiescence ? she said all that was reasonable and proper on the business ; felt the claims of dr shirley to repose as she ought ; saw how very desirable it was that he should have some active , respectable young man , as a resident curate , and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of such resident curate ’ s being married .
austen	persuasion	“ i wish , ” said henrietta , very well pleased with her companion , “ i wish lady russell lived at uppercross , and were intimate with dr shirley . i have always heard of lady russell as a woman of the greatest influence with everybody ! i always look upon her as able to persuade a person to anything ! i am afraid of her , as i have told you before , quite afraid of her , because she is so very clever ; but i respect her amazingly , and wish we had such a neighbour at uppercross . ”
austen	persuasion	anne was amused by henrietta ’ s manner of being grateful , and amused also that the course of events and the new interests of henrietta ’ s views should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the musgrove family ; she had only time , however , for a general answer , and a wish that such another woman were at uppercross , before all subjects suddenly ceased , on seeing louisa and captain wentworth coming towards them . they came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready ; but louisa recollecting , immediately afterwards that she had something to procure at a shop , invited them all to go back with her into the town . they were all at her disposal .
austen	persuasion	when they came to the steps , leading upwards from the beach , a gentleman , at the same moment preparing to come down , politely drew back , and stopped to give them way . they ascended and passed him ; and as they passed , anne ’ s face caught his eye , and he looked at her with a degree of earnest admiration , which she could not be insensible of . she was looking remarkably well ; her very regular , very pretty features , having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind which had been blowing on her complexion , and by the animation of eye which it had also produced . it was evident that the gentleman , ( completely a gentleman in manner ) admired her exceedingly . captain wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which shewed his noticing of it . he gave her a momentary glance , a glance of brightness , which seemed to say , “ that man is struck with you , and even i , at this moment , see something like anne elliot again . ”
austen	persuasion	after attending louisa through her business , and loitering about a little longer , they returned to the inn ; and anne , in passing afterwards quickly from her own chamber to their dining-room , had nearly run against the very same gentleman , as he came out of an adjoining apartment . she had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves , and determined that a well-looking groom , who was strolling about near the two inns as they came back , should be his servant . both master and man being in mourning assisted the idea . it was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves ; and this second meeting , short as it was , also proved again by the gentleman ’ s looks , that he thought hers very lovely , and by the readiness and propriety of his apologies , that he was a man of exceedingly good manners . he seemed about thirty , and though not handsome , had an agreeable person . anne felt that she should like to know who he was .
austen	persuasion	they had nearly done breakfast , when the sound of a carriage , ( almost the first they had heard since entering lyme ) drew half the party to the window . it was a gentleman ’ s carriage , a curricle , but only coming round from the stable-yard to the front door ; somebody must be going away . it was driven by a servant in mourning .
austen	persuasion	the word curricle made charles musgrove jump up that he might compare it with his own ; the servant in mourning roused anne ’ s curiosity , and the whole six were collected to look , by the time the owner of the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows and civilities of the household , and taking his seat , to drive off .
austen	persuasion	“ ah ! ” cried captain wentworth , instantly , and with half a glance at anne , “ it is the very man we passed. ” the miss musgroves agreed to it ; and having all kindly watched him as far up the hill as they could , they returned to the breakfast table . the waiter came into the room soon afterwards .
austen	persuasion	“ pray , ” said captain wentworth , immediately , “ can you tell us the name of the gentleman who is just gone away ? ” “ yes , sir , a mr elliot , a gentleman of large fortune , came in last night from sidmouth . dare say you heard the carriage , sir , while you were at dinner ; and going on now for crewkherne , in his way to bath and london . ”
austen	persuasion	“ elliot ! ” many had looked on each other , and many had repeated the name , before all this had been got through , even by the smart rapidity of a waiter . “ bless me ! ” cried mary ; “ it must be our cousin ; it must be our mr elliot , it must , indeed ! charles , anne , must not it ? in mourning , you see , just as our mr elliot must be . how very extraordinary ! in the very same inn with us ! anne , must not it be our mr elliot ? my father ’ s next heir ? pray sir , ” turning to the waiter , “ did not you hear , did not his servant say whether he belonged to the kellynch family ? ”
austen	persuasion	“ no , ma ’ am , he did not mention no particular family ; but he said his master was a very rich gentleman , and would be a baronight some day. ” “ there ! you see ! ” cried mary in an ecstasy , “ just as i said ! heir to sir walter elliot ! i was sure that would come out , if it was so . depend upon it , that is a circumstance which his servants take care to publish , wherever he goes . but , anne , only conceive how extraordinary ! i wish i had looked at him more . i wish we had been aware in time , who it was , that he might have been introduced to us . what a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other ! do you think he had the elliot countenance ? i hardly looked at him , i was looking at the horses ; but i think he had something of the elliot countenance , i wonder the arms did not strike me ! oh ! the great-coat was hanging over the panel , and hid the arms , so it did ; otherwise , i am sure , i should have observed them , and the livery too ; if the servant had not been in mourning , one should have known him by the livery . ”
austen	persuasion	“ putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together , ” said captain wentworth , “ we must consider it to be the arrangement of providence , that you should not be introduced to your cousin. ” when she could command mary ’ s attention , anne quietly tried to convince her that their father and mr elliot had not , for many years , been on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction at all desirable .
austen	persuasion	at the same time , however , it was a secret gratification to herself to have seen her cousin , and to know that the future owner of kellynch was undoubtedly a gentleman , and had an air of good sense . she would not , upon any account , mention her having met with him the second time ; luckily mary did not much attend to their having passed close by him in their earlier walk , but she would have felt quite ill-used by anne ’ s having actually run against him in the passage , and received his very polite excuses , while she had never been near him at all ; no , that cousinly little interview must remain a perfect secret .
austen	persuasion	“ of course , ” said mary , “ you will mention our seeing mr elliot , the next time you write to bath . i think my father certainly ought to hear of it ; do mention all about him . ”
austen	persuasion	anne avoided a direct reply , but it was just the circumstance which she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated , but as what ought to be suppressed . the offence which had been given her father , many years back , she knew ; elizabeth ’ s particular share in it she suspected ; and that mr elliot ’ s idea always produced irritation in both was beyond a doubt . mary never wrote to bath herself ; all the toil of keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with elizabeth fell on anne .
austen	persuasion	breakfast had not been long over , when they were joined by captain and mrs harville and captain benwick ; with whom they had appointed to take their last walk about lyme . they ought to be setting off for uppercross by one , and in the meanwhile were to be all together , and out of doors as long as they could .
austen	persuasion	anne found captain benwick getting near her , as soon as they were all fairly in the street . their conversation the preceding evening did not disincline him to seek her again ; and they walked together some time , talking as before of mr scott and lord byron , and still as unable as before , and as unable as any other two readers , to think exactly alike of the merits of either , till something occasioned an almost general change amongst their party , and instead of captain benwick , she had captain harville by her side .
austen	persuasion	“ miss elliot , ” said he , speaking rather low , “ you have done a good deed in making that poor fellow talk so much . i wish he could have such company oftener . it is bad for him , i know , to be shut up as he is ; but what can we do ? we can not part . ”
austen	persuasion	“ no , ” said anne , “ that i can easily believe to be impossible ; but in time , perhaps—we know what time does in every case of affliction , and you must remember , captain harville , that your friend may yet be called a young mourner—only last summer , i understand . ”
austen	persuasion	“ ay , true enough , ” ( with a deep sigh ) “ only june. ” “ and not known to him , perhaps , so soon. ” “ not till the first week of august , when he came home from the cape , just made into the grappler . i was at plymouth dreading to hear of him ; he sent in letters , but the grappler was under orders for portsmouth . there the news must follow him , but who was to tell it ? not i. i would as soon have been run up to the yard-arm . nobody could do it , but that good fellow ” ( pointing to captain wentworth . ) “ the laconia had come into plymouth the week before ; no danger of her being sent to sea again . he stood his chance for the rest ; wrote up for leave of absence , but without waiting the return , travelled night and day till he got to portsmouth , rowed off to the grappler that instant , and never left the poor fellow for a week . that ’ s what he did , and nobody else could have saved poor james . you may think , miss elliot , whether he is dear to us ! ”
austen	persuasion	anne did think on the question with perfect decision , and said as much in reply as her own feeling could accomplish , or as his seemed able to bear , for he was too much affected to renew the subject , and when he spoke again , it was of something totally different .
austen	persuasion	mrs harville ’ s giving it as her opinion that her husband would have quite walking enough by the time he reached home , determined the direction of all the party in what was to be their last walk ; they would accompany them to their door , and then return and set off themselves . by all their calculations there was just time for this ; but as they drew near the cobb , there was such a general wish to walk along it once more , all were so inclined , and louisa soon grew so determined , that the difference of a quarter of an hour , it was found , would be no difference at all ; so with all the kind leave-taking , and all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which may be imagined , they parted from captain and mrs harville at their own door , and still accompanied by captain benwick , who seemed to cling to them to the last , proceeded to make the proper adieus to the cobb .
austen	persuasion	anne found captain benwick again drawing near her . lord byron ’ s “ dark blue seas ” could not fail of being brought forward by their present view , and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as attention was possible . it was soon drawn , perforce another way .
austen	persuasion	there was too much wind to make the high part of the new cobb pleasant for the ladies , and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower , and all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight , excepting louisa ; she must be jumped down them by captain wentworth . in all their walks , he had had to jump her from the stiles ; the sensation was delightful to her . the hardness of the pavement for her feet , made him less willing upon the present occasion ; he did it , however . she was safely down , and instantly , to show her enjoyment , ran up the steps to be jumped down again . he advised her against it , thought the jar too great ; but no , he reasoned and talked in vain , she smiled and said , “ i am determined i will : ” he put out his hands ; she was too precipitate by half a second , she fell on the pavement on the lower cobb , and was taken up lifeless ! there was no wound , no blood , no visible bruise ; but her eyes were closed , she breathed not , her face was like death . the horror of the moment to all who stood around !
austen	persuasion	captain wentworth , who had caught her up , knelt with her in his arms , looking on her with a face as pallid as her own , in an agony of silence . “ she is dead ! she is dead ! ” screamed mary , catching hold of her husband , and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable ; and in another moment , henrietta , sinking under the conviction , lost her senses too , and would have fallen on the steps , but for captain benwick and anne , who caught and supported her between them .
austen	persuasion	“ is there no one to help me ? ” were the first words which burst from captain wentworth , in a tone of despair , and as if all his own strength were gone .
austen	persuasion	“ go to him , go to him , ” cried anne , “ for heaven ’ s sake go to him . i can support her myself . leave me , and go to him . rub her hands , rub her temples ; here are salts ; take them , take them . ”
austen	persuasion	captain benwick obeyed , and charles at the same moment , disengaging himself from his wife , they were both with him ; and louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them , and everything was done that anne had prompted , but in vain ; while captain wentworth , staggering against the wall for his support , exclaimed in the bitterest agony—
austen	persuasion	“ oh god ! her father and mother ! ” “ a surgeon ! ” said anne . he caught the word ; it seemed to rouse him at once , and saying only— “ true , true , a surgeon this instant , ” was darting away , when anne eagerly suggested—
austen	persuasion	“ captain benwick , would not it be better for captain benwick ? he knows where a surgeon is to be found. ” every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea , and in a moment ( it was all done in rapid moments ) captain benwick had resigned the poor corpse-like figure entirely to the brother ’ s care , and was off for the town with the utmost rapidity .
austen	persuasion	as to the wretched party left behind , it could scarcely be said which of the three , who were completely rational , was suffering most : captain wentworth , anne , or charles , who , really a very affectionate brother , hung over louisa with sobs of grief , and could only turn his eyes from one sister , to see the other in a state as insensible , or to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife , calling on him for help which he could not give .
austen	persuasion	anne , attending with all the strength and zeal , and thought , which instinct supplied , to henrietta , still tried , at intervals , to suggest comfort to the others , tried to quiet mary , to animate charles , to assuage the feelings of captain wentworth . both seemed to look to her for directions .
austen	persuasion	“ anne , anne , ” cried charles , “ what is to be done next ? what , in heaven ’ s name , is to be done next ? ” captain wentworth ’ s eyes were also turned towards her . “ had not she better be carried to the inn ? yes , i am sure : carry her gently to the inn . ”
austen	persuasion	“ yes , yes , to the inn , ” repeated captain wentworth , comparatively collected , and eager to be doing something . “ i will carry her myself . musgrove , take care of the others. ” by this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen and boatmen about the cobb , and many were collected near them , to be useful if wanted , at any rate , to enjoy the sight of a dead young lady , nay , two dead young ladies , for it proved twice as fine as the first report . to some of the best-looking of these good people henrietta was consigned , for , though partially revived , she was quite helpless ; and in this manner , anne walking by her side , and charles attending to his wife , they set forward , treading back with feelings unutterable , the ground , which so lately , so very lately , and so light of heart , they had passed along .
austen	persuasion	they were not off the cobb , before the harvilles met them . captain benwick had been seen flying by their house , with a countenance which showed something to be wrong ; and they had set off immediately , informed and directed as they passed , towards the spot . shocked as captain harville was , he brought senses and nerves that could be instantly useful ; and a look between him and his wife decided what was to be done . she must be taken to their house ; all must go to their house ; and await the surgeon ’ s arrival there . they would not listen to scruples : he was obeyed ; they were all beneath his roof ; and while louisa , under mrs harville ’ s direction , was conveyed up stairs , and given possession of her own bed , assistance , cordials , restoratives were supplied by her husband to all who needed them .
austen	persuasion	louisa had once opened her eyes , but soon closed them again , without apparent consciousness . this had been a proof of life , however , of service to her sister ; and henrietta , though perfectly incapable of being in the same room with louisa , was kept , by the agitation of hope and fear , from a return of her own insensibility . mary , too , was growing calmer .
austen	persuasion	the surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible . they were sick with horror , while he examined ; but he was not hopeless . the head had received a severe contusion , but he had seen greater injuries recovered from : he was by no means hopeless ; he spoke cheerfully .
austen	persuasion	that he did not regard it as a desperate case , that he did not say a few hours must end it , was at first felt , beyond the hope of most ; and the ecstasy of such a reprieve , the rejoicing , deep and silent , after a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to heaven had been offered , may be conceived .
austen	persuasion	the tone , the look , with which “ thank god ! ” was uttered by captain wentworth , anne was sure could never be forgotten by her ; nor the sight of him afterwards , as he sat near a table , leaning over it with folded arms and face concealed , as if overpowered by the various feelings of his soul , and trying by prayer and reflection to calm them .
austen	persuasion	louisa ’ s limbs had escaped . there was no injury but to the head . it now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done , as to their general situation . they were now able to speak to each other and consult . that louisa must remain where she was , however distressing to her friends to be involving the harvilles in such trouble , did not admit a doubt . her removal was impossible . the harvilles silenced all scruples ; and , as much as they could , all gratitude . they had looked forward and arranged everything before the others began to reflect . captain benwick must give up his room to them , and get another bed elsewhere ; and the whole was settled . they were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more ; and yet perhaps , by “ putting the children away in the maid ’ s room , or swinging a cot somewhere , ” they could hardly bear to think of not finding room for two or three besides , supposing they might wish to stay ; though , with regard to any attendance on miss musgrove , there need not be the least uneasiness in leaving her to mrs harville ’ s care entirely . mrs harville was a very experienced nurse , and her nursery-maid , who had lived with her long , and gone about with her everywhere , was just such another . between these two , she could want no possible attendance by day or night . and all this was said with a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible .
austen	persuasion	charles , henrietta , and captain wentworth were the three in consultation , and for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror . “ uppercross , the necessity of some one ’ s going to uppercross ; the news to be conveyed ; how it could be broken to mr and mrs musgrove ; the lateness of the morning ; an hour already gone since they ought to have been off ; the impossibility of being in tolerable time. ” at first , they were capable of nothing more to the purpose than such exclamations ; but , after a while , captain wentworth , exerting himself , said—
austen	persuasion	“ we must be decided , and without the loss of another minute . every minute is valuable . some one must resolve on being off for uppercross instantly . musgrove , either you or i must go . ”
austen	persuasion	charles agreed , but declared his resolution of not going away . he would be as little incumbrance as possible to captain and mrs harville ; but as to leaving his sister in such a state , he neither ought , nor would . so far it was decided ; and henrietta at first declared the same . she , however , was soon persuaded to think differently . the usefulness of her staying ! she who had not been able to remain in louisa ’ s room , or to look at her , without sufferings which made her worse than helpless ! she was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good , yet was still unwilling to be away , till , touched by the thought of her father and mother , she gave it up ; she consented , she was anxious to be at home .
austen	persuasion	the plan had reached this point , when anne , coming quietly down from louisa ’ s room , could not but hear what followed , for the parlour door was open . “ then it is settled , musgrove , ” cried captain wentworth , “ that you stay , and that i take care of your sister home . but as to the rest , as to the others , if one stays to assist mrs harville , i think it need be only one . mrs charles musgrove will , of course , wish to get back to her children ; but if anne will stay , no one so proper , so capable as anne . ”
austen	persuasion	she paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself so spoken of . the other two warmly agreed with what he said , and she then appeared . “ you will stay , i am sure ; you will stay and nurse her ; ” cried he , turning to her and speaking with a glow , and yet a gentleness , which seemed almost restoring the past . she coloured deeply , and he recollected himself and moved away . she expressed herself most willing , ready , happy to remain . “ it was what she had been thinking of , and wishing to be allowed to do . a bed on the floor in louisa ’ s room would be sufficient for her , if mrs harville would but think so . ”
austen	persuasion	one thing more , and all seemed arranged . though it was rather desirable that mr and mrs musgrove should be previously alarmed by some share of delay ; yet the time required by the uppercross horses to take them back , would be a dreadful extension of suspense ; and captain wentworth proposed , and charles musgrove agreed , that it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn , and leave mr musgrove ’ s carriage and horses to be sent home the next morning early , when there would be the farther advantage of sending an account of louisa ’ s night .
austen	persuasion	captain wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part , and to be soon followed by the two ladies . when the plan was made known to mary , however , there was an end of all peace in it . she was so wretched and so vehement , complained so much of injustice in being expected to go away instead of anne ; anne , who was nothing to louisa , while she was her sister , and had the best right to stay in henrietta ’ s stead ! why was not she to be as useful as anne ? and to go home without charles , too , without her husband ! no , it was too unkind . and in short , she said more than her husband could long withstand , and as none of the others could oppose when he gave way , there was no help for it ; the change of mary for anne was inevitable .
austen	persuasion	anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous and ill-judging claims of mary ; but so it must be , and they set off for the town , charles taking care of his sister , and captain benwick attending to her . she gave a moment ’ s recollection , as they hurried along , to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed earlier in the morning . there she had listened to henrietta ’ s schemes for dr shirley ’ s leaving uppercross ; farther on , she had first seen mr elliot ; a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but louisa , or those who were wrapt up in her welfare .
austen	persuasion	captain benwick was most considerately attentive to her ; and , united as they all seemed by the distress of the day , she felt an increasing degree of good-will towards him , and a pleasure even in thinking that it might , perhaps , be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance .
austen	persuasion	captain wentworth was on the watch for them , and a chaise and four in waiting , stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street ; but his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister for the other , the change in his countenance , the astonishment , the expressions begun and suppressed , with which charles was listened to , made but a mortifying reception of anne ; or must at least convince her that she was valued only as she could be useful to louisa .
austen	persuasion	she endeavoured to be composed , and to be just . without emulating the feelings of an emma towards her henry , she would have attended on louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard , for his sake ; and she hoped he would not long be so unjust as to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend .
austen	persuasion	in the meanwhile she was in the carriage . he had handed them both in , and placed himself between them ; and in this manner , under these circumstances , full of astonishment and emotion to anne , she quitted lyme . how the long stage would pass ; how it was to affect their manners ; what was to be their sort of intercourse , she could not foresee . it was all quite natural , however . he was devoted to henrietta ; always turning towards her ; and when he spoke at all , always with the view of supporting her hopes and raising her spirits . in general , his voice and manner were studiously calm . to spare henrietta from agitation seemed the governing principle . once only , when she had been grieving over the last ill-judged , ill-fated walk to the cobb , bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of , he burst forth , as if wholly overcome—
austen	persuasion	“ don ’ t talk of it , don ’ t talk of it , ” he cried . “ oh god ! that i had not given way to her at the fatal moment ! had i done as i ought ! but so eager and so resolute ! dear , sweet louisa ! ”
austen	persuasion	anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now , to question the justness of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage of firmness of character ; and whether it might not strike him that , like all other qualities of the mind , it should have its proportions and limits . she thought it could scarcely escape him to feel that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness as a very resolute character .
austen	persuasion	they got on fast . anne was astonished to recognise the same hills and the same objects so soon . their actual speed , heightened by some dread of the conclusion , made the road appear but half as long as on the day before . it was growing quite dusk , however , before they were in the neighbourhood of uppercross , and there had been total silence among them for some time , henrietta leaning back in the corner , with a shawl over her face , giving the hope of her having cried herself to sleep ; when , as they were going up their last hill , anne found herself all at once addressed by captain wentworth . in a low , cautious voice , he said : —
austen	persuasion	“ i have been considering what we had best do . she must not appear at first . she could not stand it . i have been thinking whether you had not better remain in the carriage with her , while i go in and break it to mr and mrs musgrove . do you think this is a good plan ? ”
austen	persuasion	she did : he was satisfied , and said no more . but the remembrance of the appeal remained a pleasure to her , as a proof of friendship , and of deference for her judgement , a great pleasure ; and when it became a sort of parting proof , its value did not lessen .
austen	persuasion	when the distressing communication at uppercross was over , and he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped , and the daughter all the better for being with them , he announced his intention of returning in the same carriage to lyme ; and when the horses were baited , he was off .
austen	persuasion	( end of volume one . ) chapter xiii . the remainder of anne ’ s time at uppercross , comprehending only two days , was spent entirely at the mansion house ; and she had the satisfaction of knowing herself extremely useful there , both as an immediate companion , and as assisting in all those arrangements for the future , which , in mr and mrs musgrove ’ s distressed state of spirits , would have been difficulties .
austen	persuasion	they had an early account from lyme the next morning . louisa was much the same . no symptoms worse than before had appeared . charles came a few hours afterwards , to bring a later and more particular account . he was tolerably cheerful . a speedy cure must not be hoped , but everything was going on as well as the nature of the case admitted . in speaking of the harvilles , he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness , especially of mrs harville ’ s exertions as a nurse . “ she really left nothing for mary to do . he and mary had been persuaded to go early to their inn last night . mary had been hysterical again this morning . when he came away , she was going to walk out with captain benwick , which , he hoped , would do her good . he almost wished she had been prevailed on to come home the day before ; but the truth was , that mrs harville left nothing for anybody to do . ”
austen	persuasion	charles was to return to lyme the same afternoon , and his father had at first half a mind to go with him , but the ladies could not consent . it would be going only to multiply trouble to the others , and increase his own distress ; and a much better scheme followed and was acted upon . a chaise was sent for from crewkherne , and charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery-maid of the family , one who having brought up all the children , and seen the very last , the lingering and long-petted master harry , sent to school after his brothers , was now living in her deserted nursery to mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could get near her , and who , consequently , was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurse dear miss louisa . vague wishes of getting sarah thither , had occurred before to mrs musgrove and henrietta ; but without anne , it would hardly have been resolved on , and found practicable so soon .
austen	persuasion	they were indebted , the next day , to charles hayter , for all the minute knowledge of louisa , which it was so essential to obtain every twenty-four hours . he made it his business to go to lyme , and his account was still encouraging . the intervals of sense and consciousness were believed to be stronger . every report agreed in captain wentworth ’ s appearing fixed in lyme .
austen	persuasion	anne was to leave them on the morrow , an event which they all dreaded . “ what should they do without her ? they were wretched comforters for one another. ” and so much was said in this way , that anne thought she could not do better than impart among them the general inclination to which she was privy , and persuaded them all to go to lyme at once . she had little difficulty ; it was soon determined that they would go ; go to-morrow , fix themselves at the inn , or get into lodgings , as it suited , and there remain till dear louisa could be moved . they must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with ; they might at least relieve mrs harville from the care of her own children ; and in short , they were so happy in the decision , that anne was delighted with what she had done , and felt that she could not spend her last morning at uppercross better than in assisting their preparations , and sending them off at an early hour , though her being left to the solitary range of the house was the consequence .
austen	persuasion	she was the last , excepting the little boys at the cottage , she was the very last , the only remaining one of all that had filled and animated both houses , of all that had given uppercross its cheerful character . a few days had made a change indeed !
austen	persuasion	if louisa recovered , it would all be well again . more than former happiness would be restored . there could not be a doubt , to her mind there was none , of what would follow her recovery . a few months hence , and the room now so deserted , occupied but by her silent , pensive self , might be filled again with all that was happy and gay , all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love , all that was most unlike anne elliot !
austen	persuasion	an hour ’ s complete leisure for such reflections as these , on a dark november day , a small thick rain almost blotting out the very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows , was enough to make the sound of lady russell ’ s carriage exceedingly welcome ; and yet , though desirous to be gone , she could not quit the mansion house , or look an adieu to the cottage , with its black , dripping and comfortless veranda , or even notice through the misty glasses the last humble tenements of the village , without a saddened heart . scenes had passed in uppercross which made it precious . it stood the record of many sensations of pain , once severe , but now softened ; and of some instances of relenting feeling , some breathings of friendship and reconciliation , which could never be looked for again , and which could never cease to be dear . she left it all behind her , all but the recollection that such things had been .
austen	persuasion	anne had never entered kellynch since her quitting lady russell ’ s house in september . it had not been necessary , and the few occasions of its being possible for her to go to the hall she had contrived to evade and escape from . her first return was to resume her place in the modern and elegant apartments of the lodge , and to gladden the eyes of its mistress .
austen	persuasion	there was some anxiety mixed with lady russell ’ s joy in meeting her . she knew who had been frequenting uppercross . but happily , either anne was improved in plumpness and looks , or lady russell fancied her so ; and anne , in receiving her compliments on the occasion , had the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration of her cousin , and of hoping that she was to be blessed with a second spring of youth and beauty .
austen	persuasion	when they came to converse , she was soon sensible of some mental change . the subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving kellynch , and which she had felt slighted , and been compelled to smother among the musgroves , were now become but of secondary interest . she had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and bath . their concerns had been sunk under those of uppercross ; and when lady russell reverted to their former hopes and fears , and spoke her satisfaction in the house in camden place , which had been taken , and her regret that mrs clay should still be with them , anne would have been ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of lyme and louisa musgrove , and all her acquaintance there ; how much more interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the harvilles and captain benwick , than her own father ’ s house in camden place , or her own sister ’ s intimacy with mrs clay . she was actually forced to exert herself to meet lady russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude , on topics which had by nature the first claim on her .
austen	persuasion	there was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse on another subject . they must speak of the accident at lyme . lady russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before , when a full account of the whole had burst on her ; but still it must be talked of , she must make enquiries , she must regret the imprudence , lament the result , and captain wentworth ’ s name must be mentioned by both . anne was conscious of not doing it so well as lady russell . she could not speak the name , and look straight forward to lady russell ’ s eye , till she had adopted the expedient of telling her briefly what she thought of the attachment between him and louisa . when this was told , his name distressed her no longer .
austen	persuasion	lady russell had only to listen composedly , and wish them happy , but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure , in pleased contempt , that the man who at twenty-three had seemed to understand somewhat of the value of an anne elliot , should , eight years afterwards , be charmed by a louisa musgrove .
austen	persuasion	the first three or four days passed most quietly , with no circumstance to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from lyme , which found their way to anne , she could not tell how , and brought a rather improving account of louisa . at the end of that period , lady russell ’ s politeness could repose no longer , and the fainter self-threatenings of the past became in a decided tone , “ i must call on mrs croft ; i really must call upon her soon . anne , have you courage to go with me , and pay a visit in that house ? it will be some trial to us both . ”
austen	persuasion	anne did not shrink from it ; on the contrary , she truly felt as she said , in observing— “ i think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two ; your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine . by remaining in the neighbourhood , i am become inured to it . ”
austen	persuasion	she could have said more on the subject ; for she had in fact so high an opinion of the crofts , and considered her father so very fortunate in his tenants , felt the parish to be so sure of a good example , and the poor of the best attention and relief , that however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal , she could not but in conscience feel that they were gone who deserved not to stay , and that kellynch hall had passed into better hands than its owners ’ . these convictions must unquestionably have their own pain , and severe was its kind ; but they precluded that pain which lady russell would suffer in entering the house again , and returning through the well-known apartments .
austen	persuasion	in such moments anne had no power of saying to herself , “ these rooms ought to belong only to us . oh , how fallen in their destination ! how unworthily occupied ! an ancient family to be so driven away ! strangers filling their place ! ” no , except when she thought of her mother , and remembered where she had been used to sit and preside , she had no sigh of that description to heave .
austen	persuasion	mrs croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure of fancying herself a favourite , and on the present occasion , receiving her in that house , there was particular attention .
austen	persuasion	the sad accident at lyme was soon the prevailing topic , and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid , it appeared that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn ; that captain wentworth had been in kellynch yesterday ( the first time since the accident ) , had brought anne the last note , which she had not been able to trace the exact steps of ; had staid a few hours and then returned again to lyme , and without any present intention of quitting it any more . he had enquired after her , she found , particularly ; had expressed his hope of miss elliot ’ s not being the worse for her exertions , and had spoken of those exertions as great . this was handsome , and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could have done .
austen	persuasion	as to the sad catastrophe itself , it could be canvassed only in one style by a couple of steady , sensible women , whose judgements had to work on ascertained events ; and it was perfectly decided that it had been the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence ; that its effects were most alarming , and that it was frightful to think , how long miss musgrove ’ s recovery might yet be doubtful , and how liable she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter ! the admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming—
austen	persuasion	“ ay , a very bad business indeed . a new sort of way this , for a young fellow to be making love , by breaking his mistress ’ s head , is not it , miss elliot ? this is breaking a head and giving a plaster , truly ! ”
austen	persuasion	admiral croft ’ s manners were not quite of the tone to suit lady russell , but they delighted anne . his goodness of heart and simplicity of character were irresistible . “ now , this must be very bad for you , ” said he , suddenly rousing from a little reverie , “ to be coming and finding us here . i had not recollected it before , i declare , but it must be very bad . but now , do not stand upon ceremony . get up and go over all the rooms in the house if you like it . ”
austen	persuasion	“ another time , sir , i thank you , not now. ” “ well , whenever it suits you . you can slip in from the shrubbery at any time ; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up by that door . a good place is not it ? but , ” ( checking himself ) , “ you will not think it a good place , for yours were always kept in the butler ’ s room . ay , so it always is , i believe . one man ’ s ways may be as good as another ’ s , but we all like our own best . and so you must judge for yourself , whether it would be better for you to go about the house or not . ”
austen	persuasion	anne , finding she might decline it , did so , very gratefully . “ we have made very few changes either , ” continued the admiral , after thinking a moment . “ very few . we told you about the laundry-door , at uppercross . that has been a very great improvement . the wonder was , how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience of its opening as it did , so long ! you will tell sir walter what we have done , and that mr shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house ever had . indeed , i must do ourselves the justice to say , that the few alterations we have made have been all very much for the better . my wife should have the credit of them , however . i have done very little besides sending away some of the large looking-glasses from my dressing-room , which was your father ’ s . a very good man , and very much the gentleman i am sure : but i should think , miss elliot , ” ( looking with serious reflection ) , “ i should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life . such a number of looking-glasses ! oh lord ! there was no getting away from one ’ s self . so i got sophy to lend me a hand , and we soon shifted their quarters ; and now i am quite snug , with my little shaving glass in one corner , and another great thing that i never go near . ”
austen	persuasion	anne , amused in spite of herself , was rather distressed for an answer , and the admiral , fearing he might not have been civil enough , took up the subject again , to say—
austen	persuasion	“ the next time you write to your good father , miss elliot , pray give him my compliments and mrs croft ’ s , and say that we are settled here quite to our liking , and have no fault at all to find with the place . the breakfast-room chimney smokes a little , i grant you , but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard , which may not happen three times a winter . and take it altogether , now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge , there is not one that we like better than this . pray say so , with my compliments . he will be glad to hear it . ”
austen	persuasion	lady russell and mrs croft were very well pleased with each other : but the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed far at present ; for when it was returned , the crofts announced themselves to be going away for a few weeks , to visit their connexions in the north of the county , and probably might not be at home again before lady russell would be removing to bath .
austen	persuasion	so ended all danger to anne of meeting captain wentworth at kellynch hall , or of seeing him in company with her friend . everything was safe enough , and she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted on the subject .
austen	persuasion	chapter xiv . though charles and mary had remained at lyme much longer after mr and mrs musgrove ’ s going than anne conceived they could have been at all wanted , they were yet the first of the family to be at home again ; and as soon as possible after their return to uppercross they drove over to the lodge . they had left louisa beginning to sit up ; but her head , though clear , was exceedingly weak , and her nerves susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness ; and though she might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well , it was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear the removal home ; and her father and mother , who must return in time to receive their younger children for the christmas holidays , had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them .
austen	persuasion	they had been all in lodgings together . mrs musgrove had got mrs harville ’ s children away as much as she could , every possible supply from uppercross had been furnished , to lighten the inconvenience to the harvilles , while the harvilles had been wanting them to come to dinner every day ; and in short , it seemed to have been only a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested and hospitable .
austen	persuasion	mary had had her evils ; but upon the whole , as was evident by her staying so long , she had found more to enjoy than to suffer . charles hayter had been at lyme oftener than suited her ; and when they dined with the harvilles there had been only a maid-servant to wait , and at first mrs harville had always given mrs musgrove precedence ; but then , she had received so very handsome an apology from her on finding out whose daughter she was , and there had been so much going on every day , there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the harvilles , and she had got books from the library , and changed them so often , that the balance had certainly been much in favour of lyme . she had been taken to charmouth too , and she had bathed , and she had gone to church , and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at lyme than at uppercross ; and all this , joined to the sense of being so very useful , had made really an agreeable fortnight .
austen	persuasion	anne enquired after captain benwick . mary ’ s face was clouded directly . charles laughed . “ oh ! captain benwick is very well , i believe , but he is a very odd young man . i do not know what he would be at . we asked him to come home with us for a day or two : charles undertook to give him some shooting , and he seemed quite delighted , and , for my part , i thought it was all settled ; when behold ! on tuesday night , he made a very awkward sort of excuse ; ‘ he never shot ’ and he had ‘ been quite misunderstood , ’ and he had promised this and he had promised that , and the end of it was , i found , that he did not mean to come . i suppose he was afraid of finding it dull ; but upon my word i should have thought we were lively enough at the cottage for such a heart-broken man as captain benwick . ”
austen	persuasion	charles laughed again and said , “ now mary , you know very well how it really was . it was all your doing , ” ( turning to anne . ) “ he fancied that if he went with us , he should find you close by : he fancied everybody to be living in uppercross ; and when he discovered that lady russell lived three miles off , his heart failed him , and he had not courage to come . that is the fact , upon my honour . mary knows it is . ”
austen	persuasion	but mary did not give into it very graciously , whether from not considering captain benwick entitled by birth and situation to be in love with an elliot , or from not wanting to believe anne a greater attraction to uppercross than herself , must be left to be guessed . anne ’ s good-will , however , was not to be lessened by what she heard . she boldly acknowledged herself flattered , and continued her enquiries .
austen	persuasion	“ oh ! he talks of you , ” cried charles , “ in such terms— ” mary interrupted him . “ i declare , charles , i never heard him mention anne twice all the time i was there . i declare , anne , he never talks of you at all . ”
austen	persuasion	“ no , ” admitted charles , “ i do not know that he ever does , in a general way ; but however , it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly . his head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation , and he wants to talk to you about them ; he has found out something or other in one of them which he thinks—oh ! i can not pretend to remember it , but it was something very fine—i overheard him telling henrietta all about it ; and then ‘ miss elliot ’ was spoken of in the highest terms ! now mary , i declare it was so , i heard it myself , and you were in the other room . ‘ elegance , sweetness , beauty. ’ oh ! there was no end of miss elliot ’ s charms . ”
austen	persuasion	“ and i am sure , ” cried mary , warmly , “ it was a very little to his credit , if he did . miss harville only died last june . such a heart is very little worth having ; is it , lady russell ? i am sure you will agree with me . ”
austen	persuasion	“ i must see captain benwick before i decide , ” said lady russell , smiling . “ and that you are very likely to do very soon , i can tell you , ma ’ am , ” said charles . “ though he had not nerves for coming away with us , and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here , he will make his way over to kellynch one day by himself , you may depend on it . i told him the distance and the road , and i told him of the church ’ s being so very well worth seeing ; for as he has a taste for those sort of things , i thought that would be a good excuse , and he listened with all his understanding and soul ; and i am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon . so , i give you notice , lady russell . ”
austen	persuasion	“ any acquaintance of anne ’ s will always be welcome to me , ” was lady russell ’ s kind answer . “ oh ! as to being anne ’ s acquaintance , ” said mary , “ i think he is rather my acquaintance , for i have been seeing him every day this last fortnight . ”
austen	persuasion	“ well , as your joint acquaintance , then , i shall be very happy to see captain benwick. ” “ you will not find anything very agreeable in him , i assure you , ma ’ am . he is one of the dullest young men that ever lived . he has walked with me , sometimes , from one end of the sands to the other , without saying a word . he is not at all a well-bred young man . i am sure you will not like him . ”
austen	persuasion	“ there we differ , mary , ” said anne . “ i think lady russell would like him . i think she would be so much pleased with his mind , that she would very soon see no deficiency in his manner . ”
austen	persuasion	“ so do i , anne , ” said charles . “ i am sure lady russell would like him . he is just lady russell ’ s sort . give him a book , and he will read all day long . ”
austen	persuasion	“ yes , that he will ! ” exclaimed mary , tauntingly . “ he will sit poring over his book , and not know when a person speaks to him , or when one drops one ’ s scissors , or anything that happens . do you think lady russell would like that ? ”
austen	persuasion	lady russell could not help laughing . “ upon my word , ” said she , “ i should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted of such difference of conjecture , steady and matter of fact as i may call myself . i have really a curiosity to see the person who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions . i wish he may be induced to call here . and when he does , mary , you may depend upon hearing my opinion ; but i am determined not to judge him beforehand . ”
austen	persuasion	“ you will not like him , i will answer for it. ” lady russell began talking of something else . mary spoke with animation of their meeting with , or rather missing , mr elliot so extraordinarily .
austen	persuasion	“ he is a man , ” said lady russell , “ whom i have no wish to see . his declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family , has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me . ”
austen	persuasion	this decision checked mary ’ s eagerness , and stopped her short in the midst of the elliot countenance . with regard to captain wentworth , though anne hazarded no enquiries , there was voluntary communication sufficient . his spirits had been greatly recovering lately as might be expected . as louisa improved , he had improved , and he was now quite a different creature from what he had been the first week . he had not seen louisa ; and was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her from an interview , that he did not press for it at all ; and , on the contrary , seemed to have a plan of going away for a week or ten days , till her head was stronger . he had talked of going down to plymouth for a week , and wanted to persuade captain benwick to go with him ; but , as charles maintained to the last , captain benwick seemed much more disposed to ride over to kellynch .
austen	persuasion	there can be no doubt that lady russell and anne were both occasionally thinking of captain benwick , from this time . lady russell could not hear the door-bell without feeling that it might be his herald ; nor could anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in her father ’ s grounds , or any visit of charity in the village , without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him . captain benwick came not , however . he was either less disposed for it than charles had imagined , or he was too shy ; and after giving him a week ’ s indulgence , lady russell determined him to be unworthy of the interest which he had been beginning to excite .
austen	persuasion	the musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school , bringing with them mrs harville ’ s little children , to improve the noise of uppercross , and lessen that of lyme . henrietta remained with louisa ; but all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters .
austen	persuasion	lady russell and anne paid their compliments to them once , when anne could not but feel that uppercross was already quite alive again . though neither henrietta , nor louisa , nor charles hayter , nor captain wentworth were there , the room presented as strong a contrast as could be wished to the last state she had seen it in .
austen	persuasion	immediately surrounding mrs musgrove were the little harvilles , whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children from the cottage , expressly arrived to amuse them . on one side was a table occupied by some chattering girls , cutting up silk and gold paper ; and on the other were tressels and trays , bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies , where riotous boys were holding high revel ; the whole completed by a roaring christmas fire , which seemed determined to be heard , in spite of all the noise of the others . charles and mary also came in , of course , during their visit , and mr musgrove made a point of paying his respects to lady russell , and sat down close to her for ten minutes , talking with a very raised voice , but from the clamour of the children on his knees , generally in vain . it was a fine family-piece .
austen	persuasion	anne , judging from her own temperament , would have deemed such a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves , which louisa ’ s illness must have so greatly shaken . but mrs musgrove , who got anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially , again and again , for all her attentions to them , concluded a short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing , with a happy glance round the room , that after all she had gone through , nothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness at home .
austen	persuasion	louisa was now recovering apace . her mother could even think of her being able to join their party at home , before her brothers and sisters went to school again . the harvilles had promised to come with her and stay at uppercross , whenever she returned . captain wentworth was gone , for the present , to see his brother in shropshire .
austen	persuasion	“ i hope i shall remember , in future , ” said lady russell , as soon as they were reseated in the carriage , “ not to call at uppercross in the christmas holidays. ” everybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters ; and sounds are quite innoxious , or most distressing , by their sort rather than their quantity . when lady russell not long afterwards , was entering bath on a wet afternoon , and driving through the long course of streets from the old bridge to camden place , amidst the dash of other carriages , the heavy rumble of carts and drays , the bawling of newspapermen , muffin-men and milkmen , and the ceaseless clink of pattens , she made no complaint . no , these were noises which belonged to the winter pleasures ; her spirits rose under their influence ; and like mrs musgrove , she was feeling , though not saying , that after being long in the country , nothing could be so good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness .
austen	persuasion	anne did not share these feelings . she persisted in a very determined , though very silent disinclination for bath ; caught the first dim view of the extensive buildings , smoking in rain , without any wish of seeing them better ; felt their progress through the streets to be , however disagreeable , yet too rapid ; for who would be glad to see her when she arrived ? and looked back , with fond regret , to the bustles of uppercross and the seclusion of kellynch .
austen	persuasion	elizabeth ’ s last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interest . mr elliot was in bath . he had called in camden place ; had called a second time , a third ; had been pointedly attentive . if elizabeth and her father did not deceive themselves , had been taking much pains to seek the acquaintance , and proclaim the value of the connection , as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect . this was very wonderful if it were true ; and lady russell was in a state of very agreeable curiosity and perplexity about mr elliot , already recanting the sentiment she had so lately expressed to mary , of his being “ a man whom she had no wish to see. ” she had a great wish to see him . if he really sought to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch , he must be forgiven for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree .
austen	persuasion	anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance , but she felt that she would rather see mr elliot again than not , which was more than she could say for many other persons in bath .
austen	persuasion	she was put down in camden place ; and lady russell then drove to her own lodgings , in rivers street . chapter xv . sir walter had taken a very good house in camden place , a lofty dignified situation , such as becomes a man of consequence ; and both he and elizabeth were settled there , much to their satisfaction .
austen	persuasion	anne entered it with a sinking heart , anticipating an imprisonment of many months , and anxiously saying to herself , “ oh ! when shall i leave you again ? ” a degree of unexpected cordiality , however , in the welcome she received , did her good . her father and sister were glad to see her , for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture , and met her with kindness . her making a fourth , when they sat down to dinner , was noticed as an advantage .
austen	persuasion	mrs clay was very pleasant , and very smiling , but her courtesies and smiles were more a matter of course . anne had always felt that she would pretend what was proper on her arrival , but the complaisance of the others was unlooked for . they were evidently in excellent spirits , and she was soon to listen to the causes . they had no inclination to listen to her . after laying out for some compliments of being deeply regretted in their old neighbourhood , which anne could not pay , they had only a few faint enquiries to make , before the talk must be all their own . uppercross excited no interest , kellynch very little : it was all bath .
austen	persuasion	they had the pleasure of assuring her that bath more than answered their expectations in every respect . their house was undoubtedly the best in camden place ; their drawing-rooms had many decided advantages over all the others which they had either seen or heard of , and the superiority was not less in the style of the fitting-up , or the taste of the furniture . their acquaintance was exceedingly sought after . everybody was wanting to visit them . they had drawn back from many introductions , and still were perpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing .
austen	persuasion	here were funds of enjoyment . could anne wonder that her father and sister were happy ? she might not wonder , but she must sigh that her father should feel no degradation in his change , should see nothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder , should find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town ; and she must sigh , and smile , and wonder too , as elizabeth threw open the folding-doors and walked with exultation from one drawing-room to the other , boasting of their space ; at the possibility of that woman , who had been mistress of kellynch hall , finding extent to be proud of between two walls , perhaps thirty feet asunder .
austen	persuasion	but this was not all which they had to make them happy . they had mr elliot too . anne had a great deal to hear of mr elliot . he was not only pardoned , they were delighted with him . he had been in bath about a fortnight ; ( he had passed through bath in november , in his way to london , when the intelligence of sir walter ’ s being settled there had of course reached him , though only twenty-four hours in the place , but he had not been able to avail himself of it ; ) but he had now been a fortnight in bath , and his first object on arriving , had been to leave his card in camden place , following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet , and when they did meet , by such great openness of conduct , such readiness to apologize for the past , such solicitude to be received as a relation again , that their former good understanding was completely re-established .
austen	persuasion	they had not a fault to find in him . he had explained away all the appearance of neglect on his own side . it had originated in misapprehension entirely . he had never had an idea of throwing himself off ; he had feared that he was thrown off , but knew not why , and delicacy had kept him silent . upon the hint of having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family and the family honours , he was quite indignant . he , who had ever boasted of being an elliot , and whose feelings , as to connection , were only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day . he was astonished , indeed , but his character and general conduct must refute it . he could refer sir walter to all who knew him ; and certainly , the pains he had been taking on this , the first opportunity of reconciliation , to be restored to the footing of a relation and heir-presumptive , was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject .
austen	persuasion	the circumstances of his marriage , too , were found to admit of much extenuation . this was an article not to be entered on by himself ; but a very intimate friend of his , a colonel wallis , a highly respectable man , perfectly the gentleman , ( and not an ill-looking man , sir walter added ) , who was living in very good style in marlborough buildings , and had , at his own particular request , been admitted to their acquaintance through mr elliot , had mentioned one or two things relative to the marriage , which made a material difference in the discredit of it .
austen	persuasion	colonel wallis had known mr elliot long , had been well acquainted also with his wife , had perfectly understood the whole story . she was certainly not a woman of family , but well educated , accomplished , rich , and excessively in love with his friend . there had been the charm . she had sought him . without that attraction , not all her money would have tempted elliot , and sir walter was , moreover , assured of her having been a very fine woman . here was a great deal to soften the business . a very fine woman with a large fortune , in love with him ! sir walter seemed to admit it as complete apology ; and though elizabeth could not see the circumstance in quite so favourable a light , she allowed it be a great extenuation .
austen	persuasion	mr elliot had called repeatedly , had dined with them once , evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked , for they gave no dinners in general ; delighted , in short , by every proof of cousinly notice , and placing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in camden place .
austen	persuasion	anne listened , but without quite understanding it . allowances , large allowances , she knew , must be made for the ideas of those who spoke . she heard it all under embellishment . all that sounded extravagant or irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin but in the language of the relators . still , however , she had the sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared , in mr elliot ’ s wishing , after an interval of so many years , to be well received by them . in a worldly view , he had nothing to gain by being on terms with sir walter ; nothing to risk by a state of variance . in all probability he was already the richer of the two , and the kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title . a sensible man , and he had looked like a very sensible man , why should it be an object to him ? she could only offer one solution ; it was , perhaps , for elizabeth ’ s sake . there might really have been a liking formerly , though convenience and accident had drawn him a different way ; and now that he could afford to please himself , he might mean to pay his addresses to her . elizabeth was certainly very handsome , with well-bred , elegant manners , and her character might never have been penetrated by mr elliot , knowing her but in public , and when very young himself . how her temper and understanding might bear the investigation of his present keener time of life was another concern and rather a fearful one . most earnestly did she wish that he might not be too nice , or too observant if elizabeth were his object ; and that elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so , and that her friend mrs clay was encouraging the idea , seemed apparent by a glance or two between them , while mr elliot ’ s frequent visits were talked of .
austen	persuasion	anne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at lyme , but without being much attended to . “ oh ! yes , perhaps , it had been mr elliot . they did not know . it might be him , perhaps. ” they could not listen to her description of him . they were describing him themselves ; sir walter especially . he did justice to his very gentlemanlike appearance , his air of elegance and fashion , his good shaped face , his sensible eye ; but , at the same time , “ must lament his being very much under-hung , a defect which time seemed to have increased ; nor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered almost every feature for the worse . mr elliot appeared to think that he ( sir walter ) was looking exactly as he had done when they last parted ; ” but sir walter had “ not been able to return the compliment entirely , which had embarrassed him . he did not mean to complain , however . mr elliot was better to look at than most men , and he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere . ”
austen	persuasion	mr elliot , and his friends in marlborough buildings , were talked of the whole evening . “ colonel wallis had been so impatient to be introduced to them ! and mr elliot so anxious that he should ! ” and there was a mrs wallis , at present known only to them by description , as she was in daily expectation of her confinement ; but mr elliot spoke of her as “ a most charming woman , quite worthy of being known in camden place , ” and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted . sir walter thought much of mrs wallis ; she was said to be an excessively pretty woman , beautiful . “ he longed to see her . he hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces he was continually passing in the streets . the worst of bath was the number of its plain women . he did not mean to say that there were no pretty women , but the number of the plain was out of all proportion . he had frequently observed , as he walked , that one handsome face would be followed by thirty , or five-and-thirty frights ; and once , as he had stood in a shop on bond street , he had counted eighty-seven women go by , one after another , without there being a tolerable face among them . it had been a frosty morning , to be sure , a sharp frost , which hardly one woman in a thousand could stand the test of . but still , there certainly were a dreadful multitude of ugly women in bath ; and as for the men ! they were infinitely worse . such scarecrows as the streets were full of ! it was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything tolerable , by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced . he had never walked anywhere arm-in-arm with colonel wallis ( who was a fine military figure , though sandy-haired ) without observing that every woman ’ s eye was upon him ; every woman ’ s eye was sure to be upon colonel wallis. ” modest sir walter ! he was not allowed to escape , however . his daughter and mrs clay united in hinting that colonel wallis ’ s companion might have as good a figure as colonel wallis , and certainly was not sandy-haired .
austen	persuasion	“ how is mary looking ? ” said sir walter , in the height of his good humour . “ the last time i saw her she had a red nose , but i hope that may not happen every day . ”
austen	persuasion	“ oh ! no , that must have been quite accidental . in general she has been in very good health and very good looks since michaelmas. ” “ if i thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds , and grow coarse , i would send her a new hat and pelisse . ”
austen	persuasion	anne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown , or a cap , would not be liable to any such misuse , when a knock at the door suspended everything . “ a knock at the door ! and so late ! it was ten o ’ clock . could it be mr elliot ? they knew he was to dine in lansdown crescent . it was possible that he might stop in his way home to ask them how they did . they could think of no one else . mrs clay decidedly thought it mr elliot ’ s knock. ” mrs clay was right . with all the state which a butler and foot-boy could give , mr elliot was ushered into the room .
austen	persuasion	it was the same , the very same man , with no difference but of dress . anne drew a little back , while the others received his compliments , and her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour , but “ he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she nor her friend had taken cold the day before , ” & c. & c ; which was all as politely done , and as politely taken , as possible , but her part must follow then . sir walter talked of his youngest daughter ; “ mr elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter ” ( there was no occasion for remembering mary ) ; and anne , smiling and blushing , very becomingly shewed to mr elliot the pretty features which he had by no means forgotten , and instantly saw , with amusement at his little start of surprise , that he had not been at all aware of who she was . he looked completely astonished , but not more astonished than pleased ; his eyes brightened ! and with the most perfect alacrity he welcomed the relationship , alluded to the past , and entreated to be received as an acquaintance already . he was quite as good-looking as he had appeared at lyme , his countenance improved by speaking , and his manners were so exactly what they ought to be , so polished , so easy , so particularly agreeable , that she could compare them in excellence to only one person ’ s manners . they were not the same , but they were , perhaps , equally good .
austen	persuasion	he sat down with them , and improved their conversation very much . there could be no doubt of his being a sensible man . ten minutes were enough to certify that . his tone , his expressions , his choice of subject , his knowing where to stop ; it was all the operation of a sensible , discerning mind . as soon as he could , he began to talk to her of lyme , wanting to compare opinions respecting the place , but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance of their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time ; to give his own route , understand something of hers , and regret that he should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her . she gave him a short account of her party and business at lyme . his regret increased as he listened . he had spent his whole solitary evening in the room adjoining theirs ; had heard voices , mirth continually ; thought they must be a most delightful set of people , longed to be with them , but certainly without the smallest suspicion of his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself . if he had but asked who the party were ! the name of musgrove would have told him enough . “ well , it would serve to cure him of an absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn , which he had adopted , when quite a young man , on the principal of its being very ungenteel to be curious .
austen	persuasion	“ the notions of a young man of one or two and twenty , ” said he , “ as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing , are more absurd , i believe , than those of any other set of beings in the world . the folly of the means they often employ is only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view . ”
austen	persuasion	but he must not be addressing his reflections to anne alone : he knew it ; he was soon diffused again among the others , and it was only at intervals that he could return to lyme .
austen	persuasion	his enquiries , however , produced at length an account of the scene she had been engaged in there , soon after his leaving the place . having alluded to “ an accident , ” he must hear the whole . when he questioned , sir walter and elizabeth began to question also , but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt . she could only compare mr elliot to lady russell , in the wish of really comprehending what had passed , and in the degree of concern for what she must have suffered in witnessing it .
austen	persuasion	he staid an hour with them . the elegant little clock on the mantel-piece had struck “ eleven with its silver sounds , ” and the watchman was beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale , before mr elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long .
austen	persuasion	anne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in camden place could have passed so well ! chapter xvi . there was one point which anne , on returning to her family , would have been more thankful to ascertain even than mr elliot ’ s being in love with elizabeth , which was , her father ’ s not being in love with mrs clay ; and she was very far from easy about it , when she had been at home a few hours . on going down to breakfast the next morning , she found there had just been a decent pretence on the lady ’ s side of meaning to leave them . she could imagine mrs clay to have said , that “ now miss anne was come , she could not suppose herself at all wanted ; ” for elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper , “ that must not be any reason , indeed . i assure you i feel it none . she is nothing to me , compared with you ; ” and she was in full time to hear her father say , “ my dear madam , this must not be . as yet , you have seen nothing of bath . you have been here only to be useful . you must not run away from us now . you must stay to be acquainted with mrs wallis , the beautiful mrs wallis . to your fine mind , i well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification . ”
austen	persuasion	he spoke and looked so much in earnest , that anne was not surprised to see mrs clay stealing a glance at elizabeth and herself . her countenance , perhaps , might express some watchfulness ; but the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought in her sister . the lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties , and promise to stay .
austen	persuasion	in the course of the same morning , anne and her father chancing to be alone together , he began to compliment her on her improved looks ; he thought her “ less thin in her person , in her cheeks ; her skin , her complexion , greatly improved ; clearer , fresher . had she been using any thing in particular ? ” “ no , nothing. ” “ merely gowland , ” he supposed . “ no , nothing at all. ” “ ha ! he was surprised at that ; ” and added , “ certainly you can not do better than to continue as you are ; you can not be better than well ; or i should recommend gowland , the constant use of gowland , during the spring months . mrs clay has been using it at my recommendation , and you see what it has done for her . you see how it has carried away her freckles . ”
austen	persuasion	if elizabeth could but have heard this ! such personal praise might have struck her , especially as it did not appear to anne that the freckles were at all lessened . but everything must take its chance . the evil of a marriage would be much diminished , if elizabeth were also to marry . as for herself , she might always command a home with lady russell .
austen	persuasion	lady russell ’ s composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial on this point , in her intercourse in camden place . the sight of mrs clay in such favour , and of anne so overlooked , was a perpetual provocation to her there ; and vexed her as much when she was away , as a person in bath who drinks the water , gets all the new publications , and has a very large acquaintance , has time to be vexed .
austen	persuasion	as mr elliot became known to her , she grew more charitable , or more indifferent , towards the others . his manners were an immediate recommendation ; and on conversing with him she found the solid so fully supporting the superficial , that she was at first , as she told anne , almost ready to exclaim , “ can this be mr elliot ? ” and could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable or estimable man . everything united in him ; good understanding , correct opinions , knowledge of the world , and a warm heart . he had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour , without pride or weakness ; he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune , without display ; he judged for himself in everything essential , without defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum . he was steady , observant , moderate , candid ; never run away with by spirits or by selfishness , which fancied itself strong feeling ; and yet , with a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely , and a value for all the felicities of domestic life , which characters of fancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess . she was sure that he had not been happy in marriage . colonel wallis said it , and lady russell saw it ; but it had been no unhappiness to sour his mind , nor ( she began pretty soon to suspect ) to prevent his thinking of a second choice . her satisfaction in mr elliot outweighed all the plague of mrs clay .
austen	persuasion	it was now some years since anne had begun to learn that she and her excellent friend could sometimes think differently ; and it did not surprise her , therefore , that lady russell should see nothing suspicious or inconsistent , nothing to require more motives than appeared , in mr elliot ’ s great desire of a reconciliation . in lady russell ’ s view , it was perfectly natural that mr elliot , at a mature time of life , should feel it a most desirable object , and what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people , to be on good terms with the head of his family ; the simplest process in the world of time upon a head naturally clear , and only erring in the heyday of youth . anne presumed , however , still to smile about it , and at last to mention “ elizabeth. ” lady russell listened , and looked , and made only this cautious reply : — “ elizabeth ! very well ; time will explain . ”
austen	persuasion	it was a reference to the future , which anne , after a little observation , felt she must submit to . she could determine nothing at present . in that house elizabeth must be first ; and she was in the habit of such general observance as “ miss elliot , ” that any particularity of attention seemed almost impossible . mr elliot , too , it must be remembered , had not been a widower seven months . a little delay on his side might be very excusable . in fact , anne could never see the crape round his hat , without fearing that she was the inexcusable one , in attributing to him such imaginations ; for though his marriage had not been very happy , still it had existed so many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery from the awful impression of its being dissolved .
austen	persuasion	however it might end , he was without any question their pleasantest acquaintance in bath : she saw nobody equal to him ; and it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about lyme , which he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again , and to see more of , as herself . they went through the particulars of their first meeting a great many times . he gave her to understand that he had looked at her with some earnestness . she knew it well ; and she remembered another person ’ s look also .
austen	persuasion	they did not always think alike . his value for rank and connexion she perceived was greater than hers . it was not merely complaisance , it must be a liking to the cause , which made him enter warmly into her father and sister ’ s solicitudes on a subject which she thought unworthy to excite them . the bath paper one morning announced the arrival of the dowager viscountess dalrymple , and her daughter , the honourable miss carteret ; and all the comfort of no . — , camden place , was swept away for many days ; for the dalrymples ( in anne ’ s opinion , most unfortunately ) were cousins of the elliots ; and the agony was how to introduce themselves properly .
austen	persuasion	anne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility , and she must acknowledge herself disappointed . she had hoped better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life , and was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen ; a wish that they had more pride ; for “ our cousins lady dalrymple and miss carteret ; ” “ our cousins , the dalrymples , ” sounded in her ears all day long .
austen	persuasion	sir walter had once been in company with the late viscount , but had never seen any of the rest of the family ; and the difficulties of the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse by letters of ceremony , ever since the death of that said late viscount , when , in consequence of a dangerous illness of sir walter ’ s at the same time , there had been an unlucky omission at kellynch . no letter of condolence had been sent to ireland . the neglect had been visited on the head of the sinner ; for when poor lady elliot died herself , no letter of condolence was received at kellynch , and , consequently , there was but too much reason to apprehend that the dalrymples considered the relationship as closed . how to have this anxious business set to rights , and be admitted as cousins again , was the question : and it was a question which , in a more rational manner , neither lady russell nor mr elliot thought unimportant . “ family connexions were always worth preserving , good company always worth seeking ; lady dalrymple had taken a house , for three months , in laura place , and would be living in style . she had been at bath the year before , and lady russell had heard her spoken of as a charming woman . it was very desirable that the connexion should be renewed , if it could be done , without any compromise of propriety on the side of the elliots . ”
austen	persuasion	sir walter , however , would choose his own means , and at last wrote a very fine letter of ample explanation , regret , and entreaty , to his right honourable cousin . neither lady russell nor mr elliot could admire the letter ; but it did all that was wanted , in bringing three lines of scrawl from the dowager viscountess . “ she was very much honoured , and should be happy in their acquaintance. ” the toils of the business were over , the sweets began . they visited in laura place , they had the cards of dowager viscountess dalrymple , and the honourable miss carteret , to be arranged wherever they might be most visible : and “ our cousins in laura place , ” — “ our cousin , lady dalrymple and miss carteret , ” were talked of to everybody .
austen	persuasion	anne was ashamed . had lady dalrymple and her daughter even been very agreeable , she would still have been ashamed of the agitation they created , but they were nothing . there was no superiority of manner , accomplishment , or understanding . lady dalrymple had acquired the name of “ a charming woman , ” because she had a smile and a civil answer for everybody . miss carteret , with still less to say , was so plain and so awkward , that she would never have been tolerated in camden place but for her birth .
austen	persuasion	lady russell confessed she had expected something better ; but yet “ it was an acquaintance worth having ; ” and when anne ventured to speak her opinion of them to mr elliot , he agreed to their being nothing in themselves , but still maintained that , as a family connexion , as good company , as those who would collect good company around them , they had their value . anne smiled and said ,
austen	persuasion	“ my idea of good company , mr elliot , is the company of clever , well-informed people , who have a great deal of conversation ; that is what i call good company. ” “ you are mistaken , ” said he gently , “ that is not good company ; that is the best . good company requires only birth , education , and manners , and with regard to education is not very nice . birth and good manners are essential ; but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing in good company ; on the contrary , it will do very well . my cousin anne shakes her head . she is not satisfied . she is fastidious . my dear cousin ” ( sitting down by her ) , “ you have a better right to be fastidious than almost any other woman i know ; but will it answer ? will it make you happy ? will it not be wiser to accept the society of those good ladies in laura place , and enjoy all the advantages of the connexion as far as possible ? you may depend upon it , that they will move in the first set in bath this winter , and as rank is rank , your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family ( our family let me say ) in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for . ”
austen	persuasion	“ yes , ” sighed anne , “ we shall , indeed , be known to be related to them ! ” then recollecting herself , and not wishing to be answered , she added , “ i certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to procure the acquaintance . i suppose ” ( smiling ) “ i have more pride than any of you ; but i confess it does vex me , that we should be so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged , which we may be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them . ”
austen	persuasion	“ pardon me , dear cousin , you are unjust in your own claims . in london , perhaps , in your present quiet style of living , it might be as you say : but in bath ; sir walter elliot and his family will always be worth knowing : always acceptable as acquaintance . ”
austen	persuasion	“ well , ” said anne , “ i certainly am proud , too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon place. ” “ i love your indignation , ” said he ; “ it is very natural . but here you are in bath , and the object is to be established here with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to sir walter elliot . you talk of being proud ; i am called proud , i know , and i shall not wish to believe myself otherwise ; for our pride , if investigated , would have the same object , i have no doubt , though the kind may seem a little different . in one point , i am sure , my dear cousin , ” ( he continued , speaking lower , though there was no one else in the room ) “ in one point , i am sure , we must feel alike . we must feel that every addition to your father ’ s society , among his equals or superiors , may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him . ”
austen	persuasion	he looked , as he spoke , to the seat which mrs clay had been lately occupying : a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant ; and though anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride , she was pleased with him for not liking mrs clay ; and her conscience admitted that his wishing to promote her father ’ s getting great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her .
austen	persuasion	chapter xvii . while sir walter and elizabeth were assiduously pushing their good fortune in laura place , anne was renewing an acquaintance of a very different description . she had called on her former governess , and had heard from her of there being an old school-fellow in bath , who had the two strong claims on her attention of past kindness and present suffering . miss hamilton , now mrs smith , had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life when it had been most valuable . anne had gone unhappy to school , grieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved , feeling her separation from home , and suffering as a girl of fourteen , of strong sensibility and not high spirits , must suffer at such a time ; and miss hamilton , three years older than herself , but still from the want of near relations and a settled home , remaining another year at school , had been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened her misery , and could never be remembered with indifference .
austen	persuasion	miss hamilton had left school , had married not long afterwards , was said to have married a man of fortune , and this was all that anne had known of her , till now that their governess ’ s account brought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form .
austen	persuasion	she was a widow and poor . her husband had been extravagant ; and at his death , about two years before , had left his affairs dreadfully involved . she had had difficulties of every sort to contend with , and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted with a severe rheumatic fever , which , finally settling in her legs , had made her for the present a cripple . she had come to bath on that account , and was now in lodgings near the hot baths , living in a very humble way , unable even to afford herself the comfort of a servant , and of course almost excluded from society .
austen	persuasion	their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit from miss elliot would give mrs smith , and anne therefore lost no time in going . she mentioned nothing of what she had heard , or what she intended , at home . it would excite no proper interest there . she only consulted lady russell , who entered thoroughly into her sentiments , and was most happy to convey her as near to mrs smith ’ s lodgings in westgate buildings , as anne chose to be taken .
austen	persuasion	the visit was paid , their acquaintance re-established , their interest in each other more than re-kindled . the first ten minutes had its awkwardness and its emotion . twelve years were gone since they had parted , and each presented a somewhat different person from what the other had imagined . twelve years had changed anne from the blooming , silent , unformed girl of fifteen , to the elegant little woman of seven-and-twenty , with every beauty except bloom , and with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle ; and twelve years had transformed the fine-looking , well-grown miss hamilton , in all the glow of health and confidence of superiority , into a poor , infirm , helpless widow , receiving the visit of her former protegee as a favour ; but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon passed away , and left only the interesting charm of remembering former partialities and talking over old times .
austen	persuasion	anne found in mrs smith the good sense and agreeable manners which she had almost ventured to depend on , and a disposition to converse and be cheerful beyond her expectation . neither the dissipations of the past—and she had lived very much in the world—nor the restrictions of the present , neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have closed her heart or ruined her spirits .
austen	persuasion	in the course of a second visit she talked with great openness , and anne ’ s astonishment increased . she could scarcely imagine a more cheerless situation in itself than mrs smith ’ s . she had been very fond of her husband : she had buried him . she had been used to affluence : it was gone . she had no child to connect her with life and happiness again , no relations to assist in the arrangement of perplexed affairs , no health to make all the rest supportable . her accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour , and a dark bedroom behind , with no possibility of moving from one to the other without assistance , which there was only one servant in the house to afford , and she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath . yet , in spite of all this , anne had reason to believe that she had moments only of languor and depression , to hours of occupation and enjoyment . how could it be ? she watched , observed , reflected , and finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude or of resignation only . a submissive spirit might be patient , a strong understanding would supply resolution , but here was something more ; here was that elasticity of mind , that disposition to be comforted , that power of turning readily from evil to good , and of finding employment which carried her out of herself , which was from nature alone . it was the choicest gift of heaven ; and anne viewed her friend as one of those instances in which , by a merciful appointment , it seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want .
austen	persuasion	there had been a time , mrs smith told her , when her spirits had nearly failed . she could not call herself an invalid now , compared with her state on first reaching bath . then she had , indeed , been a pitiable object ; for she had caught cold on the journey , and had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain ; and all this among strangers , with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse , and finances at that moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense . she had weathered it , however , and could truly say that it had done her good . it had increased her comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands . she had seen too much of the world , to expect sudden or disinterested attachment anywhere , but her illness had proved to her that her landlady had a character to preserve , and would not use her ill ; and she had been particularly fortunate in her nurse , as a sister of her landlady , a nurse by profession , and who had always a home in that house when unemployed , chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her . “ and she , ” said mrs smith , “ besides nursing me most admirably , has really proved an invaluable acquaintance . as soon as i could use my hands she taught me to knit , which has been a great amusement ; and she put me in the way of making these little thread-cases , pin-cushions and card-racks , which you always find me so busy about , and which supply me with the means of doing a little good to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood . she had a large acquaintance , of course professionally , among those who can afford to buy , and she disposes of my merchandise . she always takes the right time for applying . everybody ’ s heart is open , you know , when they have recently escaped from severe pain , or are recovering the blessing of health , and nurse rooke thoroughly understands when to speak . she is a shrewd , intelligent , sensible woman . hers is a line for seeing human nature ; and she has a fund of good sense and observation , which , as a companion , make her infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received ‘ the best education in the world , ’ know nothing worth attending to . call it gossip , if you will , but when nurse rooke has half an hour ’ s leisure to bestow on me , she is sure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable : something that makes one know one ’ s species better . one likes to hear what is going on , to be _au fait_ as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly . to me , who live so much alone , her conversation , i assure you , is a treat . ”
austen	persuasion	anne , far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure , replied , “ i can easily believe it . women of that class have great opportunities , and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to . such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing ! and it is not merely in its follies , that they are well read ; for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting . what instances must pass before them of ardent , disinterested , self-denying attachment , of heroism , fortitude , patience , resignation : of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices that ennoble us most . a sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volumes . ”
austen	persuasion	“ yes , ” said mrs smith more doubtingly , “ sometimes it may , though i fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe . here and there , human nature may be great in times of trial ; but generally speaking , it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a sick chamber : it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity and fortitude , that one hears of . there is so little real friendship in the world ! and unfortunately ” ( speaking low and tremulously ) “ there are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late . ”
austen	persuasion	anne saw the misery of such feelings . the husband had not been what he ought , and the wife had been led among that part of mankind which made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved . it was but a passing emotion however with mrs smith ; she shook it off , and soon added in a different tone—
austen	persuasion	“ i do not suppose the situation my friend mrs rooke is in at present , will furnish much either to interest or edify me . she is only nursing mrs wallis of marlborough buildings ; a mere pretty , silly , expensive , fashionable woman , i believe ; and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and finery . i mean to make my profit of mrs wallis , however . she has plenty of money , and i intend she shall buy all the high-priced things i have in hand now . ”
austen	persuasion	anne had called several times on her friend , before the existence of such a person was known in camden place . at last , it became necessary to speak of her . sir walter , elizabeth and mrs clay , returned one morning from laura place , with a sudden invitation from lady dalrymple for the same evening , and anne was already engaged , to spend that evening in westgate buildings . she was not sorry for the excuse . they were only asked , she was sure , because lady dalrymple being kept at home by a bad cold , was glad to make use of the relationship which had been so pressed on her ; and she declined on her own account with great alacrity— “ she was engaged to spend the evening with an old schoolfellow. ” they were not much interested in anything relative to anne ; but still there were questions enough asked , to make it understood what this old schoolfellow was ; and elizabeth was disdainful , and sir walter severe .
austen	persuasion	“ westgate buildings ! ” said he , “ and who is miss anne elliot to be visiting in westgate buildings ? a mrs smith . a widow mrs smith ; and who was her husband ? one of five thousand mr smiths whose names are to be met with everywhere . and what is her attraction ? that she is old and sickly . upon my word , miss anne elliot , you have the most extraordinary taste ! everything that revolts other people , low company , paltry rooms , foul air , disgusting associations are inviting to you . but surely you may put off this old lady till to-morrow : she is not so near her end , i presume , but that she may hope to see another day . what is her age ? forty ? ”
austen	persuasion	“ no , sir , she is not one-and-thirty ; but i do not think i can put off my engagement , because it is the only evening for some time which will at once suit her and myself . she goes into the warm bath to-morrow , and for the rest of the week , you know , we are engaged . ”
austen	persuasion	“ but what does lady russell think of this acquaintance ? ” asked elizabeth . “ she sees nothing to blame in it , ” replied anne ; “ on the contrary , she approves it , and has generally taken me when i have called on mrs smith . ”
austen	persuasion	“ westgate buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance of a carriage drawn up near its pavement , ” observed sir walter . “ sir henry russell ’ s widow , indeed , has no honours to distinguish her arms , but still it is a handsome equipage , and no doubt is well known to convey a miss elliot . a widow mrs smith lodging in westgate buildings ! a poor widow barely able to live , between thirty and forty ; a mere mrs smith , an every-day mrs smith , of all people and all names in the world , to be the chosen friend of miss anne elliot , and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility of england and ireland ! mrs smith ! such a name ! ”
austen	persuasion	mrs clay , who had been present while all this passed , now thought it advisable to leave the room , and anne could have said much , and did long to say a little in defence of _her_ friend ’ s not very dissimilar claims to theirs , but her sense of personal respect to her father prevented her . she made no reply . she left it to himself to recollect , that mrs smith was not the only widow in bath between thirty and forty , with little to live on , and no surname of dignity .
austen	persuasion	anne kept her appointment ; the others kept theirs , and of course she heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening . she had been the only one of the set absent , for sir walter and elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship ’ s service themselves , but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others , and had been at the trouble of inviting both lady russell and mr elliot ; and mr elliot had made a point of leaving colonel wallis early , and lady russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements in order to wait on her . anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could supply from lady russell . to her , its greatest interest must be , in having been very much talked of between her friend and mr elliot ; in having been wished for , regretted , and at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause . her kind , compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow , sick and reduced , seemed to have quite delighted mr elliot . he thought her a most extraordinary young woman ; in her temper , manners , mind , a model of female excellence . he could meet even lady russell in a discussion of her merits ; and anne could not be given to understand so much by her friend , could not know herself to be so highly rated by a sensible man , without many of those agreeable sensations which her friend meant to create .
austen	persuasion	lady russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of mr elliot . she was as much convinced of his meaning to gain anne in time as of his deserving her , and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks which would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood , and leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing . she would not speak to anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject , she would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter , of a possible attachment on his side , of the desirableness of the alliance , supposing such attachment to be real and returned . anne heard her , and made no violent exclamations ; she only smiled , blushed , and gently shook her head .
austen	persuasion	“ i am no match-maker , as you well know , ” said lady russell , “ being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations . i only mean that if mr elliot should some time hence pay his addresses to you , and if you should be disposed to accept him , i think there would be every possibility of your being happy together . a most suitable connection everybody must consider it , but i think it might be a very happy one . ”
austen	persuasion	“ mr elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man , and in many respects i think highly of him , ” said anne ; “ but we should not suit. ” lady russell let this pass , and only said in rejoinder , “ i own that to be able to regard you as the future mistress of kellynch , the future lady elliot , to look forward and see you occupying your dear mother ’ s place , succeeding to all her rights , and all her popularity , as well as to all her virtues , would be the highest possible gratification to me . you are your mother ’ s self in countenance and disposition ; and if i might be allowed to fancy you such as she was , in situation and name , and home , presiding and blessing in the same spot , and only superior to her in being more highly valued ! my dearest anne , it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time of life ! ”
austen	persuasion	anne was obliged to turn away , to rise , to walk to a distant table , and , leaning there in pretended employment , try to subdue the feelings this picture excited . for a few moments her imagination and her heart were bewitched . the idea of becoming what her mother had been ; of having the precious name of “ lady elliot ” first revived in herself ; of being restored to kellynch , calling it her home again , her home for ever , was a charm which she could not immediately resist . lady russell said not another word , willing to leave the matter to its own operation ; and believing that , could mr elliot at that moment with propriety have spoken for himself ! —she believed , in short , what anne did not believe . the same image of mr elliot speaking for himself brought anne to composure again . the charm of kellynch and of “ lady elliot ” all faded away . she never could accept him . and it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man save one ; her judgement , on a serious consideration of the possibilities of such a case , was against mr elliot .
austen	persuasion	though they had now been acquainted a month , she could not be satisfied that she really knew his character . that he was a sensible man , an agreeable man , that he talked well , professed good opinions , seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle , this was all clear enough . he certainly knew what was right , nor could she fix on any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed ; but yet she would have been afraid to answer for his conduct . she distrusted the past , if not the present . the names which occasionally dropt of former associates , the allusions to former practices and pursuits , suggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been . she saw that there had been bad habits ; that sunday travelling had been a common thing ; that there had been a period of his life ( and probably not a short one ) when he had been , at least , careless in all serious matters ; and , though he might now think very differently , who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever , cautious man , grown old enough to appreciate a fair character ? how could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed ?
austen	persuasion	mr elliot was rational , discreet , polished , but he was not open . there was never any burst of feeling , any warmth of indignation or delight , at the evil or good of others . this , to anne , was a decided imperfection . her early impressions were incurable . she prized the frank , the open-hearted , the eager character beyond all others . warmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still . she felt that she could so much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked or said a careless or a hasty thing , than of those whose presence of mind never varied , whose tongue never slipped .
austen	persuasion	mr elliot was too generally agreeable . various as were the tempers in her father ’ s house , he pleased them all . he endured too well , stood too well with every body . he had spoken to her with some degree of openness of mrs clay ; had appeared completely to see what mrs clay was about , and to hold her in contempt ; and yet mrs clay found him as agreeable as any body .
austen	persuasion	lady russell saw either less or more than her young friend , for she saw nothing to excite distrust . she could not imagine a man more exactly what he ought to be than mr elliot ; nor did she ever enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive the hand of her beloved anne in kellynch church , in the course of the following autumn .
austen	persuasion	chapter xviii . it was the beginning of february ; and anne , having been a month in bath , was growing very eager for news from uppercross and lyme . she wanted to hear much more than mary had communicated . it was three weeks since she had heard at all . she only knew that henrietta was at home again ; and that louisa , though considered to be recovering fast , was still in lyme ; and she was thinking of them all very intently one evening , when a thicker letter than usual from mary was delivered to her ; and , to quicken the pleasure and surprise , with admiral and mrs croft ’ s compliments .
austen	persuasion	the crofts must be in bath ! a circumstance to interest her . they were people whom her heart turned to very naturally . “ what is this ? ” cried sir walter . “ the crofts have arrived in bath ? the crofts who rent kellynch ? what have they brought you ? ”
austen	persuasion	“ a letter from uppercross cottage , sir. ” “ oh ! those letters are convenient passports . they secure an introduction . i should have visited admiral croft , however , at any rate . i know what is due to my tenant . ”
austen	persuasion	anne could listen no longer ; she could not even have told how the poor admiral ’ s complexion escaped ; her letter engrossed her . it had been begun several days back . “ february 1st .
austen	persuasion	“ my dear anne , i make no apology for my silence , because i know how little people think of letters in such a place as bath . you must be a great deal too happy to care for uppercross , which , as you well know , affords little to write about . we have had a very dull christmas ; mr and mrs musgrove have not had one dinner party all the holidays . i do not reckon the hayters as anybody . the holidays , however , are over at last : i believe no children ever had such long ones . i am sure i had not . the house was cleared yesterday , except of the little harvilles ; but you will be surprised to hear they have never gone home . mrs harville must be an odd mother to part with them so long . i do not understand it . they are not at all nice children , in my opinion ; but mrs musgrove seems to like them quite as well , if not better , than her grandchildren . what dreadful weather we have had ! it may not be felt in bath , with your nice pavements ; but in the country it is of some consequence . i have not had a creature call on me since the second week in january , except charles hayter , who had been calling much oftener than was welcome . between ourselves , i think it a great pity henrietta did not remain at lyme as long as louisa ; it would have kept her a little out of his way . the carriage is gone to-day , to bring louisa and the harvilles to-morrow . we are not asked to dine with them , however , till the day after , mrs musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey , which is not very likely , considering the care that will be taken of her ; and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to-morrow . i am glad you find mr elliot so agreeable , and wish i could be acquainted with him too ; but i have my usual luck : i am always out of the way when any thing desirable is going on ; always the last of my family to be noticed . what an immense time mrs clay has been staying with elizabeth ! does she never mean to go away ? but perhaps if she were to leave the room vacant , we might not be invited . let me know what you think of this . i do not expect my children to be asked , you know . i can leave them at the great house very well , for a month or six weeks . i have this moment heard that the crofts are going to bath almost immediately ; they think the admiral gouty . charles heard it quite by chance ; they have not had the civility to give me any notice , or of offering to take anything . i do not think they improve at all as neighbours . we see nothing of them , and this is really an instance of gross inattention . charles joins me in love , and everything proper . yours affectionately ,
austen	persuasion	“ mary m——. ” “ i am sorry to say that i am very far from well ; and jemima has just told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore-throat very much about . i dare say i shall catch it ; and my sore-throats , you know , are always worse than anybody ’ s . ”
austen	persuasion	so ended the first part , which had been afterwards put into an envelope , containing nearly as much more . “ i kept my letter open , that i might send you word how louisa bore her journey , and now i am extremely glad i did , having a great deal to add . in the first place , i had a note from mrs croft yesterday , offering to convey anything to you ; a very kind , friendly note indeed , addressed to me , just as it ought ; i shall therefore be able to make my letter as long as i like . the admiral does not seem very ill , and i sincerely hope bath will do him all the good he wants . i shall be truly glad to have them back again . our neighbourhood can not spare such a pleasant family . but now for louisa . i have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little . she and the harvilles came on tuesday very safely , and in the evening we went to ask her how she did , when we were rather surprised not to find captain benwick of the party , for he had been invited as well as the harvilles ; and what do you think was the reason ? neither more nor less than his being in love with louisa , and not choosing to venture to uppercross till he had had an answer from mr musgrove ; for it was all settled between him and her before she came away , and he had written to her father by captain harville . true , upon my honour ! are not you astonished ? i shall be surprised at least if you ever received a hint of it , for i never did . mrs musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter . we are all very well pleased , however , for though it is not equal to her marrying captain wentworth , it is infinitely better than charles hayter ; and mr musgrove has written his consent , and captain benwick is expected to-day . mrs harville says her husband feels a good deal on his poor sister ’ s account ; but , however , louisa is a great favourite with both . indeed , mrs harville and i quite agree that we love her the better for having nursed her . charles wonders what captain wentworth will say ; but if you remember , i never thought him attached to louisa ; i never could see anything of it . and this is the end , you see , of captain benwick ’ s being supposed to be an admirer of yours . how charles could take such a thing into his head was always incomprehensible to me . i hope he will be more agreeable now . certainly not a great match for louisa musgrove , but a million times better than marrying among the hayters . ”
austen	persuasion	mary need not have feared her sister ’ s being in any degree prepared for the news . she had never in her life been more astonished . captain benwick and louisa musgrove ! it was almost too wonderful for belief , and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain in the room , preserve an air of calmness , and answer the common questions of the moment . happily for her , they were not many . sir walter wanted to know whether the crofts travelled with four horses , and whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of bath as it might suit miss elliot and himself to visit in ; but had little curiosity beyond .
austen	persuasion	“ how is mary ? ” said elizabeth ; and without waiting for an answer , “ and pray what brings the crofts to bath ? ” “ they come on the admiral ’ s account . he is thought to be gouty . ”
austen	persuasion	“ gout and decrepitude ! ” said sir walter . “ poor old gentleman. ” “ have they any acquaintance here ? ” asked elizabeth . “ i do not know ; but i can hardly suppose that , at admiral croft ’ s time of life , and in his profession , he should not have many acquaintance in such a place as this . ”
austen	persuasion	“ i suspect , ” said sir walter coolly , “ that admiral croft will be best known in bath as the renter of kellynch hall . elizabeth , may we venture to present him and his wife in laura place ? ”
austen	persuasion	“ oh , no ! i think not . situated as we are with lady dalrymple , cousins , we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance she might not approve . if we were not related , it would not signify ; but as cousins , she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours . we had better leave the crofts to find their own level . there are several odd-looking men walking about here , who , i am told , are sailors . the crofts will associate with them . ”
austen	persuasion	this was sir walter and elizabeth ’ s share of interest in the letter ; when mrs clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention , in an enquiry after mrs charles musgrove , and her fine little boys , anne was at liberty .
austen	persuasion	in her own room , she tried to comprehend it . well might charles wonder how captain wentworth would feel ! perhaps he had quitted the field , had given louisa up , had ceased to love , had found he did not love her . she could not endure the idea of treachery or levity , or anything akin to ill usage between him and his friend . she could not endure that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly .
austen	persuasion	captain benwick and louisa musgrove ! the high-spirited , joyous-talking louisa musgrove , and the dejected , thinking , feeling , reading , captain benwick , seemed each of them everything that would not suit the other . their minds most dissimilar ! where could have been the attraction ? the answer soon presented itself . it had been in situation . they had been thrown together several weeks ; they had been living in the same small family party : since henrietta ’ s coming away , they must have been depending almost entirely on each other , and louisa , just recovering from illness , had been in an interesting state , and captain benwick was not inconsolable . that was a point which anne had not been able to avoid suspecting before ; and instead of drawing the same conclusion as mary , from the present course of events , they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some dawning of tenderness toward herself . she did not mean , however , to derive much more from it to gratify her vanity , than mary might have allowed . she was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have received the same compliment . he had an affectionate heart . he must love somebody .
austen	persuasion	she saw no reason against their being happy . louisa had fine naval fervour to begin with , and they would soon grow more alike . he would gain cheerfulness , and she would learn to be an enthusiast for scott and lord byron ; nay , that was probably learnt already ; of course they had fallen in love over poetry . the idea of louisa musgrove turned into a person of literary taste , and sentimental reflection was amusing , but she had no doubt of its being so . the day at lyme , the fall from the cobb , might influence her health , her nerves , her courage , her character to the end of her life , as thoroughly as it appeared to have influenced her fate .
austen	persuasion	the conclusion of the whole was , that if the woman who had been sensible of captain wentworth ’ s merits could be allowed to prefer another man , there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder ; and if captain wentworth lost no friend by it , certainly nothing to be regretted . no , it was not regret which made anne ’ s heart beat in spite of herself , and brought the colour into her cheeks when she thought of captain wentworth unshackled and free . she had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate . they were too much like joy , senseless joy !
austen	persuasion	she longed to see the crofts ; but when the meeting took place , it was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them . the visit of ceremony was paid and returned ; and louisa musgrove was mentioned , and captain benwick , too , without even half a smile .
austen	persuasion	the crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in gay street , perfectly to sir walter ’ s satisfaction . he was not at all ashamed of the acquaintance , and did , in fact , think and talk a great deal more about the admiral , than the admiral ever thought or talked about him .
austen	persuasion	the crofts knew quite as many people in bath as they wished for , and considered their intercourse with the elliots as a mere matter of form , and not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure . they brought with them their country habit of being almost always together . he was ordered to walk to keep off the gout , and mrs croft seemed to go shares with him in everything , and to walk for her life to do him good . anne saw them wherever she went . lady russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning , and she never failed to think of them , and never failed to see them . knowing their feelings as she did , it was a most attractive picture of happiness to her . she always watched them as long as she could , delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of , as they walked along in happy independence , or equally delighted to see the admiral ’ s hearty shake of the hand when he encountered an old friend , and observe their eagerness of conversation when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy , mrs croft looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her .
austen	persuasion	anne was too much engaged with lady russell to be often walking herself ; but it so happened that one morning , about a week or ten days after the croft ’ s arrival , it suited her best to leave her friend , or her friend ’ s carriage , in the lower part of the town , and return alone to camden place , and in walking up milsom street she had the good fortune to meet with the admiral . he was standing by himself at a printshop window , with his hands behind him , in earnest contemplation of some print , and she not only might have passed him unseen , but was obliged to touch as well as address him before she could catch his notice . when he did perceive and acknowledge her , however , it was done with all his usual frankness and good humour . “ ha ! is it you ? thank you , thank you . this is treating me like a friend . here i am , you see , staring at a picture . i can never get by this shop without stopping . but what a thing here is , by way of a boat ! do look at it . did you ever see the like ? what queer fellows your fine painters must be , to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless old cockleshell as that ? and yet here are two gentlemen stuck up in it mightily at their ease , and looking about them at the rocks and mountains , as if they were not to be upset the next moment , which they certainly must be . i wonder where that boat was built ! ” ( laughing heartily ) ; “ i would not venture over a horsepond in it . well , ” ( turning away ) , “ now , where are you bound ? can i go anywhere for you , or with you ? can i be of any use ? ”
austen	persuasion	“ none , i thank you , unless you will give me the pleasure of your company the little way our road lies together . i am going home. ” “ that i will , with all my heart , and farther , too . yes , yes we will have a snug walk together , and i have something to tell you as we go along . there , take my arm ; that ’ s right ; i do not feel comfortable if i have not a woman there . lord ! what a boat it is ! ” taking a last look at the picture , as they began to be in motion .
austen	persuasion	“ did you say that you had something to tell me , sir ? ” “ yes , i have , presently . but here comes a friend , captain brigden ; i shall only say , ‘ how d ’ ye do ? ’ as we pass , however . i shall not stop . ‘ how d ’ ye do ? ’ brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife . she , poor soul , is tied by the leg . she has a blister on one of her heels , as large as a three-shilling piece . if you look across the street , you will see admiral brand coming down and his brother . shabby fellows , both of them ! i am glad they are not on this side of the way . sophy can not bear them . they played me a pitiful trick once : got away with some of my best men . i will tell you the whole story another time . there comes old sir archibald drew and his grandson . look , he sees us ; he kisses his hand to you ; he takes you for my wife . ah ! the peace has come too soon for that younker . poor old sir archibald ! how do you like bath , miss elliot ? it suits us very well . we are always meeting with some old friend or other ; the streets full of them every morning ; sure to have plenty of chat ; and then we get away from them all , and shut ourselves in our lodgings , and draw in our chairs , and are as snug as if we were at kellynch , ay , or as we used to be even at north yarmouth and deal . we do not like our lodgings here the worse , i can tell you , for putting us in mind of those we first had at north yarmouth . the wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way . ”
austen	persuasion	when they were got a little farther , anne ventured to press again for what he had to communicate . she hoped when clear of milsom street to have her curiosity gratified ; but she was still obliged to wait , for the admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had gained the greater space and quiet of belmont ; and as she was not really mrs croft , she must let him have his own way . as soon as they were fairly ascending belmont , he began—
austen	persuasion	“ well , now you shall hear something that will surprise you . but first of all , you must tell me the name of the young lady i am going to talk about . that young lady , you know , that we have all been so concerned for . the miss musgrove , that all this has been happening to . her christian name : i always forget her christian name . ”
austen	persuasion	anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really did ; but now she could safely suggest the name of “ louisa. ” “ ay , ay , miss louisa musgrove , that is the name . i wish young ladies had not such a number of fine christian names . i should never be out if they were all sophys , or something of that sort . well , this miss louisa , we all thought , you know , was to marry frederick . he was courting her week after week . the only wonder was , what they could be waiting for , till the business at lyme came ; then , indeed , it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain was set to right . but even then there was something odd in their way of going on . instead of staying at lyme , he went off to plymouth , and then he went off to see edward . when we came back from minehead he was gone down to edward ’ s , and there he has been ever since . we have seen nothing of him since november . even sophy could not understand it . but now , the matter has taken the strangest turn of all ; for this young lady , the same miss musgrove , instead of being to marry frederick , is to marry james benwick . you know james benwick . ”
austen	persuasion	“ a little . i am a little acquainted with captain benwick. ” “ well , she is to marry him . nay , most likely they are married already , for i do not know what they should wait for . ”
austen	persuasion	“ i thought captain benwick a very pleasing young man , ” said anne , “ and i understand that he bears an excellent character. ” “ oh ! yes , yes , there is not a word to be said against james benwick . he is only a commander , it is true , made last summer , and these are bad times for getting on , but he has not another fault that i know of . an excellent , good-hearted fellow , i assure you ; a very active , zealous officer too , which is more than you would think for , perhaps , for that soft sort of manner does not do him justice . ”
austen	persuasion	“ indeed you are mistaken there , sir ; i should never augur want of spirit from captain benwick ’ s manners . i thought them particularly pleasing , and i will answer for it , they would generally please . ”
austen	persuasion	“ well , well , ladies are the best judges ; but james benwick is rather too piano for me ; and though very likely it is all our partiality , sophy and i can not help thinking frederick ’ s manners better than his . there is something about frederick more to our taste . ”
austen	persuasion	anne was caught . she had only meant to oppose the too common idea of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other , not at all to represent captain benwick ’ s manners as the very best that could possibly be ; and , after a little hesitation , she was beginning to say , “ i was not entering into any comparison of the two friends , ” but the admiral interrupted her with—
austen	persuasion	“ and the thing is certainly true . it is not a mere bit of gossip . we have it from frederick himself . his sister had a letter from him yesterday , in which he tells us of it , and he had just had it in a letter from harville , written upon the spot , from uppercross . i fancy they are all at uppercross . ”
austen	persuasion	this was an opportunity which anne could not resist ; she said , therefore , “ i hope , admiral , i hope there is nothing in the style of captain wentworth ’ s letter to make you and mrs croft particularly uneasy . it did seem , last autumn , as if there were an attachment between him and louisa musgrove ; but i hope it may be understood to have worn out on each side equally , and without violence . i hope his letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill-used man . ”
austen	persuasion	“ not at all , not at all ; there is not an oath or a murmur from beginning to end. ” anne looked down to hide her smile . “ no , no ; frederick is not a man to whine and complain ; he has too much spirit for that . if the girl likes another man better , it is very fit she should have him . ”
austen	persuasion	“ certainly . but what i mean is , that i hope there is nothing in captain wentworth ’ s manner of writing to make you suppose he thinks himself ill-used by his friend , which might appear , you know , without its being absolutely said . i should be very sorry that such a friendship as has subsisted between him and captain benwick should be destroyed , or even wounded , by a circumstance of this sort . ”
austen	persuasion	“ yes , yes , i understand you . but there is nothing at all of that nature in the letter . he does not give the least fling at benwick ; does not so much as say , ‘ i wonder at it , i have a reason of my own for wondering at it. ’ no , you would not guess , from his way of writing , that he had ever thought of this miss ( what ’ s her name ? ) for himself . he very handsomely hopes they will be happy together ; and there is nothing very unforgiving in that , i think . ”
austen	persuasion	anne did not receive the perfect conviction which the admiral meant to convey , but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther . she therefore satisfied herself with common-place remarks or quiet attention , and the admiral had it all his own way .
austen	persuasion	“ poor frederick ! ” said he at last . “ now he must begin all over again with somebody else . i think we must get him to bath . sophy must write , and beg him to come to bath . here are pretty girls enough , i am sure . it would be of no use to go to uppercross again , for that other miss musgrove , i find , is bespoke by her cousin , the young parson . do not you think , miss elliot , we had better try to get him to bath ? ”
austen	persuasion	chapter xix . while admiral croft was taking this walk with anne , and expressing his wish of getting captain wentworth to bath , captain wentworth was already on his way thither . before mrs croft had written , he was arrived , and the very next time anne walked out , she saw him .
austen	persuasion	mr elliot was attending his two cousins and mrs clay . they were in milsom street . it began to rain , not much , but enough to make shelter desirable for women , and quite enough to make it very desirable for miss elliot to have the advantage of being conveyed home in lady dalrymple ’ s carriage , which was seen waiting at a little distance ; she , anne , and mrs clay , therefore , turned into molland ’ s , while mr elliot stepped to lady dalrymple , to request her assistance . he soon joined them again , successful , of course ; lady dalrymple would be most happy to take them home , and would call for them in a few minutes .
austen	persuasion	her ladyship ’ s carriage was a barouche , and did not hold more than four with any comfort . miss carteret was with her mother ; consequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation for all the three camden place ladies . there could be no doubt as to miss elliot . whoever suffered inconvenience , she must suffer none , but it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility between the other two . the rain was a mere trifle , and anne was most sincere in preferring a walk with mr elliot . but the rain was also a mere trifle to mrs clay ; she would hardly allow it even to drop at all , and her boots were so thick ! much thicker than miss anne ’ s ; and , in short , her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left to walk with mr elliot as anne could be , and it was discussed between them with a generosity so polite and so determined , that the others were obliged to settle it for them ; miss elliot maintaining that mrs clay had a little cold already , and mr elliot deciding on appeal , that his cousin anne ’ s boots were rather the thickest .
austen	persuasion	it was fixed accordingly , that mrs clay should be of the party in the carriage ; and they had just reached this point , when anne , as she sat near the window , descried , most decidedly and distinctly , captain wentworth walking down the street .
austen	persuasion	her start was perceptible only to herself ; but she instantly felt that she was the greatest simpleton in the world , the most unaccountable and absurd ! for a few minutes she saw nothing before her ; it was all confusion . she was lost , and when she had scolded back her senses , she found the others still waiting for the carriage , and mr elliot ( always obliging ) just setting off for union street on a commission of mrs clay ’ s .
austen	persuasion	she now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door ; she wanted to see if it rained . why was she to suspect herself of another motive ? captain wentworth must be out of sight . she left her seat , she would go ; one half of her should not be always so much wiser than the other half , or always suspecting the other of being worse than it was . she would see if it rained . she was sent back , however , in a moment by the entrance of captain wentworth himself , among a party of gentlemen and ladies , evidently his acquaintance , and whom he must have joined a little below milsom street . he was more obviously struck and confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before ; he looked quite red . for the first time , since their renewed acquaintance , she felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two . she had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments . all the overpowering , blinding , bewildering , first effects of strong surprise were over with her . still , however , she had enough to feel ! it was agitation , pain , pleasure , a something between delight and misery .
austen	persuasion	he spoke to her , and then turned away . the character of his manner was embarrassment . she could not have called it either cold or friendly , or anything so certainly as embarrassed .
austen	persuasion	after a short interval , however , he came towards her , and spoke again . mutual enquiries on common subjects passed : neither of them , probably , much the wiser for what they heard , and anne continuing fully sensible of his being less at ease than formerly . they had by dint of being so very much together , got to speak to each other with a considerable portion of apparent indifference and calmness ; but he could not do it now . time had changed him , or louisa had changed him . there was consciousness of some sort or other . he looked very well , not as if he had been suffering in health or spirits , and he talked of uppercross , of the musgroves , nay , even of louisa , and had even a momentary look of his own arch significance as he named her ; but yet it was captain wentworth not comfortable , not easy , not able to feign that he was .
austen	persuasion	it did not surprise , but it grieved anne to observe that elizabeth would not know him . she saw that he saw elizabeth , that elizabeth saw him , that there was complete internal recognition on each side ; she was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance , expecting it , and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away with unalterable coldness .
austen	persuasion	lady dalrymple ’ s carriage , for which miss elliot was growing very impatient , now drew up ; the servant came in to announce it . it was beginning to rain again , and altogether there was a delay , and a bustle , and a talking , which must make all the little crowd in the shop understand that lady dalrymple was calling to convey miss elliot . at last miss elliot and her friend , unattended but by the servant , ( for there was no cousin returned ) , were walking off ; and captain wentworth , watching them , turned again to anne , and by manner , rather than words , was offering his services to her .
austen	persuasion	“ i am much obliged to you , ” was her answer , “ but i am not going with them . the carriage would not accommodate so many . i walk : i prefer walking. ” “ but it rains . ”
austen	persuasion	“ oh ! very little , nothing that i regard. ” after a moment ’ s pause he said : “ though i came only yesterday , i have equipped myself properly for bath already , you see , ” ( pointing to a new umbrella ) ; “ i wish you would make use of it , if you are determined to walk ; though i think it would be more prudent to let me get you a chair . ”
austen	persuasion	she was very much obliged to him , but declined it all , repeating her conviction , that the rain would come to nothing at present , and adding , “ i am only waiting for mr elliot . he will be here in a moment , i am sure . ”
austen	persuasion	she had hardly spoken the words when mr elliot walked in . captain wentworth recollected him perfectly . there was no difference between him and the man who had stood on the steps at lyme , admiring anne as she passed , except in the air and look and manner of the privileged relation and friend . he came in with eagerness , appeared to see and think only of her , apologised for his stay , was grieved to have kept her waiting , and anxious to get her away without further loss of time and before the rain increased ; and in another moment they walked off together , her arm under his , a gentle and embarrassed glance , and a “ good morning to you ! ” being all that she had time for , as she passed away .
austen	persuasion	as soon as they were out of sight , the ladies of captain wentworth ’ s party began talking of them . “ mr elliot does not dislike his cousin , i fancy ? ” “ oh ! no , that is clear enough . one can guess what will happen there . he is always with them ; half lives in the family , i believe . what a very good-looking man ! ”
austen	persuasion	“ yes , and miss atkinson , who dined with him once at the wallises , says he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with. ” “ she is pretty , i think ; anne elliot ; very pretty , when one comes to look at her . it is not the fashion to say so , but i confess i admire her more than her sister . ”
austen	persuasion	“ oh ! so do i. ” “ and so do i . no comparison . but the men are all wild after miss elliot . anne is too delicate for them. ” anne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin , if he would have walked by her side all the way to camden place , without saying a word . she had never found it so difficult to listen to him , though nothing could exceed his solicitude and care , and though his subjects were principally such as were wont to be always interesting : praise , warm , just , and discriminating , of lady russell , and insinuations highly rational against mrs clay . but just now she could think only of captain wentworth . she could not understand his present feelings , whether he were really suffering much from disappointment or not ; and till that point were settled , she could not be quite herself .
austen	persuasion	she hoped to be wise and reasonable in time ; but alas ! alas ! she must confess to herself that she was not wise yet . another circumstance very essential for her to know , was how long he meant to be in bath ; he had not mentioned it , or she could not recollect it . he might be only passing through . but it was more probable that he should be come to stay . in that case , so liable as every body was to meet every body in bath , lady russell would in all likelihood see him somewhere . would she recollect him ? how would it all be ?
austen	persuasion	she had already been obliged to tell lady russell that louisa musgrove was to marry captain benwick . it had cost her something to encounter lady russell ’ s surprise ; and now , if she were by any chance to be thrown into company with captain wentworth , her imperfect knowledge of the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him .
austen	persuasion	the following morning anne was out with her friend , and for the first hour , in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain ; but at last , in returning down pulteney street , she distinguished him on the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view the greater part of the street . there were many other men about him , many groups walking the same way , but there was no mistaking him . she looked instinctively at lady russell ; but not from any mad idea of her recognising him so soon as she did herself . no , it was not to be supposed that lady russell would perceive him till they were nearly opposite . she looked at her however , from time to time , anxiously ; and when the moment approached which must point him out , though not daring to look again ( for her own countenance she knew was unfit to be seen ) , she was yet perfectly conscious of lady russell ’ s eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him—of her being , in short , intently observing him . she could thoroughly comprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over lady russell ’ s mind , the difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes , the astonishment she must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him , and in foreign climes and in active service too , without robbing him of one personal grace !
austen	persuasion	at last , lady russell drew back her head . “ now , how would she speak of him ? ” “ you will wonder , ” said she , “ what has been fixing my eye so long ; but i was looking after some window-curtains , which lady alicia and mrs frankland were telling me of last night . they described the drawing-room window-curtains of one of the houses on this side of the way , and this part of the street , as being the handsomest and best hung of any in bath , but could not recollect the exact number , and i have been trying to find out which it could be ; but i confess i can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description . ”
austen	persuasion	anne sighed and blushed and smiled , in pity and disdain , either at her friend or herself . the part which provoked her most , was that in all this waste of foresight and caution , she should have lost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them .
austen	persuasion	a day or two passed without producing anything . the theatre or the rooms , where he was most likely to be , were not fashionable enough for the elliots , whose evening amusements were solely in the elegant stupidity of private parties , in which they were getting more and more engaged ; and anne , wearied of such a state of stagnation , sick of knowing nothing , and fancying herself stronger because her strength was not tried , was quite impatient for the concert evening . it was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by lady dalrymple . of course they must attend . it was really expected to be a good one , and captain wentworth was very fond of music . if she could only have a few minutes conversation with him again , she fancied she should be satisfied ; and as to the power of addressing him , she felt all over courage if the opportunity occurred . elizabeth had turned from him , lady russell overlooked him ; her nerves were strengthened by these circumstances ; she felt that she owed him attention .
austen	persuasion	she had once partly promised mrs smith to spend the evening with her ; but in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off , with the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow . mrs smith gave a most good-humoured acquiescence .
austen	persuasion	“ by all means , ” said she ; “ only tell me all about it , when you do come . who is your party ? ” anne named them all . mrs smith made no reply ; but when she was leaving her said , and with an expression half serious , half arch , “ well , i heartily wish your concert may answer ; and do not fail me to-morrow if you can come ; for i begin to have a foreboding that i may not have many more visits from you . ”
austen	persuasion	anne was startled and confused ; but after standing in a moment ’ s suspense , was obliged , and not sorry to be obliged , to hurry away . chapter xx . sir walter , his two daughters , and mrs clay , were the earliest of all their party at the rooms in the evening ; and as lady dalrymple must be waited for , they took their station by one of the fires in the octagon room . but hardly were they so settled , when the door opened again , and captain wentworth walked in alone . anne was the nearest to him , and making yet a little advance , she instantly spoke . he was preparing only to bow and pass on , but her gentle “ how do you do ? ” brought him out of the straight line to stand near her , and make enquiries in return , in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground . their being in the back ground was a support to anne ; she knew nothing of their looks , and felt equal to everything which she believed right to be done .
austen	persuasion	while they were speaking , a whispering between her father and elizabeth caught her ear . she could not distinguish , but she must guess the subject ; and on captain wentworth ’ s making a distant bow , she comprehended that her father had judged so well as to give him that simple acknowledgement of acquaintance , and she was just in time by a side glance to see a slight curtsey from elizabeth herself . this , though late , and reluctant , and ungracious , was yet better than nothing , and her spirits improved .
austen	persuasion	after talking , however , of the weather , and bath , and the concert , their conversation began to flag , and so little was said at last , that she was expecting him to go every moment , but he did not ; he seemed in no hurry to leave her ; and presently with renewed spirit , with a little smile , a little glow , he said—
austen	persuasion	“ i have hardly seen you since our day at lyme . i am afraid you must have suffered from the shock , and the more from its not overpowering you at the time . ”
austen	persuasion	she assured him that she had not . “ it was a frightful hour , ” said he , “ a frightful day ! ” and he passed his hand across his eyes , as if the remembrance were still too painful , but in a moment , half smiling again , added , “ the day has produced some effects however ; has had some consequences which must be considered as the very reverse of frightful . when you had the presence of mind to suggest that benwick would be the properest person to fetch a surgeon , you could have little idea of his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery . ”
austen	persuasion	“ certainly i could have none . but it appears—i should hope it would be a very happy match . there are on both sides good principles and good temper. ” “ yes , ” said he , looking not exactly forward ; “ but there , i think , ends the resemblance . with all my soul i wish them happy , and rejoice over every circumstance in favour of it . they have no difficulties to contend with at home , no opposition , no caprice , no delays . the musgroves are behaving like themselves , most honourably and kindly , only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter ’ s comfort . all this is much , very much in favour of their happiness ; more than perhaps— ”
austen	persuasion	he stopped . a sudden recollection seemed to occur , and to give him some taste of that emotion which was reddening anne ’ s cheeks and fixing her eyes on the ground . after clearing his throat , however , he proceeded thus—
austen	persuasion	“ i confess that i do think there is a disparity , too great a disparity , and in a point no less essential than mind . i regard louisa musgrove as a very amiable , sweet-tempered girl , and not deficient in understanding , but benwick is something more . he is a clever man , a reading man ; and i confess , that i do consider his attaching himself to her with some surprise . had it been the effect of gratitude , had he learnt to love her , because he believed her to be preferring him , it would have been another thing . but i have no reason to suppose it so . it seems , on the contrary , to have been a perfectly spontaneous , untaught feeling on his side , and this surprises me . a man like him , in his situation ! with a heart pierced , wounded , almost broken ! fanny harville was a very superior creature , and his attachment to her was indeed attachment . a man does not recover from such a devotion of the heart to such a woman . he ought not ; he does not . ”
austen	persuasion	either from the consciousness , however , that his friend had recovered , or from other consciousness , he went no farther ; and anne who , in spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered , and in spite of all the various noises of the room , the almost ceaseless slam of the door , and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through , had distinguished every word , was struck , gratified , confused , and beginning to breathe very quick , and feel an hundred things in a moment . it was impossible for her to enter on such a subject ; and yet , after a pause , feeling the necessity of speaking , and having not the smallest wish for a total change , she only deviated so far as to say—
austen	persuasion	“ you were a good while at lyme , i think ? ” “ about a fortnight . i could not leave it till louisa ’ s doing well was quite ascertained . i had been too deeply concerned in the mischief to be soon at peace . it had been my doing , solely mine . she would not have been obstinate if i had not been weak . the country round lyme is very fine . i walked and rode a great deal ; and the more i saw , the more i found to admire . ”
austen	persuasion	“ i should very much like to see lyme again , ” said anne . “ indeed ! i should not have supposed that you could have found anything in lyme to inspire such a feeling . the horror and distress you were involved in , the stretch of mind , the wear of spirits ! i should have thought your last impressions of lyme must have been strong disgust . ”
austen	persuasion	“ the last hours were certainly very painful , ” replied anne ; “ but when pain is over , the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure . one does not love a place the less for having suffered in it , unless it has been all suffering , nothing but suffering , which was by no means the case at lyme . we were only in anxiety and distress during the last two hours , and previously there had been a great deal of enjoyment . so much novelty and beauty ! i have travelled so little , that every fresh place would be interesting to me ; but there is real beauty at lyme ; and in short ” ( with a faint blush at some recollections ) , “ altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable . ”
austen	persuasion	as she ceased , the entrance door opened again , and the very party appeared for whom they were waiting . “ lady dalrymple , lady dalrymple , ” was the rejoicing sound ; and with all the eagerness compatible with anxious elegance , sir walter and his two ladies stepped forward to meet her . lady dalrymple and miss carteret , escorted by mr elliot and colonel wallis , who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant , advanced into the room . the others joined them , and it was a group in which anne found herself also necessarily included . she was divided from captain wentworth . their interesting , almost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time , but slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on ! she had learnt , in the last ten minutes , more of his feelings towards louisa , more of all his feelings than she dared to think of ; and she gave herself up to the demands of the party , to the needful civilities of the moment , with exquisite , though agitated sensations . she was in good humour with all . she had received ideas which disposed her to be courteous and kind to all , and to pity every one , as being less happy than herself .
austen	persuasion	the delightful emotions were a little subdued , when on stepping back from the group , to be joined again by captain wentworth , she saw that he was gone . she was just in time to see him turn into the concert room . he was gone ; he had disappeared , she felt a moment ’ s regret . but “ they should meet again . he would look for her , he would find her out before the evening were over , and at present , perhaps , it was as well to be asunder . she was in need of a little interval for recollection . ”
austen	persuasion	upon lady russell ’ s appearance soon afterwards , the whole party was collected , and all that remained was to marshal themselves , and proceed into the concert room ; and be of all the consequence in their power , draw as many eyes , excite as many whispers , and disturb as many people as they could .
austen	persuasion	very , very happy were both elizabeth and anne elliot as they walked in . elizabeth arm in arm with miss carteret , and looking on the broad back of the dowager viscountess dalrymple before her , had nothing to wish for which did not seem within her reach ; and anne—but it would be an insult to the nature of anne ’ s felicity , to draw any comparison between it and her sister ’ s ; the origin of one all selfish vanity , of the other all generous attachment .
austen	persuasion	anne saw nothing , thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room . her happiness was from within . her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed ; but she knew nothing about it . she was thinking only of the last half hour , and as they passed to their seats , her mind took a hasty range over it . his choice of subjects , his expressions , and still more his manner and look , had been such as she could see in only one light . his opinion of louisa musgrove ’ s inferiority , an opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give , his wonder at captain benwick , his feelings as to a first , strong attachment ; sentences begun which he could not finish , his half averted eyes and more than half expressive glance , all , all declared that he had a heart returning to her at least ; that anger , resentment , avoidance , were no more ; and that they were succeeded , not merely by friendship and regard , but by the tenderness of the past . yes , some share of the tenderness of the past . she could not contemplate the change as implying less . he must love her .
austen	persuasion	these were thoughts , with their attendant visions , which occupied and flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation ; and she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him , without even trying to discern him . when their places were determined on , and they were all properly arranged , she looked round to see if he should happen to be in the same part of the room , but he was not ; her eye could not reach him ; and the concert being just opening , she must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way .
austen	persuasion	the party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches : anne was among those on the foremost , and mr elliot had manœuvred so well , with the assistance of his friend colonel wallis , as to have a seat by her . miss elliot , surrounded by her cousins , and the principal object of colonel wallis ’ s gallantry , was quite contented .
austen	persuasion	anne ’ s mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment of the evening ; it was just occupation enough : she had feelings for the tender , spirits for the gay , attention for the scientific , and patience for the wearisome ; and had never liked a concert better , at least during the first act . towards the close of it , in the interval succeeding an italian song , she explained the words of the song to mr elliot . they had a concert bill between them .
austen	persuasion	“ this , ” said she , “ is nearly the sense , or rather the meaning of the words , for certainly the sense of an italian love-song must not be talked of , but it is as nearly the meaning as i can give ; for i do not pretend to understand the language . i am a very poor italian scholar . ”
austen	persuasion	“ yes , yes , i see you are . i see you know nothing of the matter . you have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight these inverted , transposed , curtailed italian lines , into clear , comprehensible , elegant english . you need not say anything more of your ignorance . here is complete proof . ”
austen	persuasion	“ i will not oppose such kind politeness ; but i should be sorry to be examined by a real proficient. ” “ i have not had the pleasure of visiting in camden place so long , ” replied he , “ without knowing something of miss anne elliot ; and i do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general to be aware of half her accomplishments , and too highly accomplished for modesty to be natural in any other woman . ”
austen	persuasion	“ for shame ! for shame ! this is too much flattery . i forget what we are to have next , ” turning to the bill . “ perhaps , ” said mr elliot , speaking low , “ i have had a longer acquaintance with your character than you are aware of . ”
austen	persuasion	“ indeed ! how so ? you can have been acquainted with it only since i came to bath , excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of in my own family. ” “ i knew you by report long before you came to bath . i had heard you described by those who knew you intimately . i have been acquainted with you by character many years . your person , your disposition , accomplishments , manner ; they were all present to me . ”
austen	persuasion	mr elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise . no one can withstand the charm of such a mystery . to have been described long ago to a recent acquaintance , by nameless people , is irresistible ; and anne was all curiosity . she wondered , and questioned him eagerly ; but in vain . he delighted in being asked , but he would not tell .
austen	persuasion	“ no , no , some time or other , perhaps , but not now . he would mention no names now ; but such , he could assure her , had been the fact . he had many years ago received such a description of miss anne elliot as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit , and excited the warmest curiosity to know her . ”
austen	persuasion	anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with partiality of her many years ago as the mr wentworth of monkford , captain wentworth ’ s brother . he might have been in mr elliot ’ s company , but she had not courage to ask the question .
austen	persuasion	“ the name of anne elliot , ” said he , “ has long had an interesting sound to me . very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy ; and , if i dared , i would breathe my wishes that the name might never change . ”
austen	persuasion	such , she believed , were his words ; but scarcely had she received their sound , than her attention was caught by other sounds immediately behind her , which rendered every thing else trivial . her father and lady dalrymple were speaking .
austen	persuasion	“ a well-looking man , ” said sir walter , “ a very well-looking man. ” “ a very fine young man indeed ! ” said lady dalrymple . “ more air than one often sees in bath . irish , i dare say . ”
austen	persuasion	“ no , i just know his name . a bowing acquaintance . wentworth ; captain wentworth of the navy . his sister married my tenant in somersetshire , the croft , who rents kellynch. ” before sir walter had reached this point , anne ’ s eyes had caught the right direction , and distinguished captain wentworth standing among a cluster of men at a little distance . as her eyes fell on him , his seemed to be withdrawn from her . it had that appearance . it seemed as if she had been one moment too late ; and as long as she dared observe , he did not look again : but the performance was recommencing , and she was forced to seem to restore her attention to the orchestra and look straight forward .
austen	persuasion	when she could give another glance , he had moved away . he could not have come nearer to her if he would ; she was so surrounded and shut in : but she would rather have caught his eye .
austen	persuasion	mr elliot ’ s speech , too , distressed her . she had no longer any inclination to talk to him . she wished him not so near her . the first act was over . now she hoped for some beneficial change ; and , after a period of nothing-saying amongst the party , some of them did decide on going in quest of tea . anne was one of the few who did not choose to move . she remained in her seat , and so did lady russell ; but she had the pleasure of getting rid of mr elliot ; and she did not mean , whatever she might feel on lady russell ’ s account , to shrink from conversation with captain wentworth , if he gave her the opportunity . she was persuaded by lady russell ’ s countenance that she had seen him .
austen	persuasion	he did not come however . anne sometimes fancied she discerned him at a distance , but he never came . the anxious interval wore away unproductively . the others returned , the room filled again , benches were reclaimed and repossessed , and another hour of pleasure or of penance was to be sat out , another hour of music was to give delight or the gapes , as real or affected taste for it prevailed . to anne , it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation . she could not quit that room in peace without seeing captain wentworth once more , without the interchange of one friendly look .
austen	persuasion	in re-settling themselves there were now many changes , the result of which was favourable for her . colonel wallis declined sitting down again , and mr elliot was invited by elizabeth and miss carteret , in a manner not to be refused , to sit between them ; and by some other removals , and a little scheming of her own , anne was enabled to place herself much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before , much more within reach of a passer-by . she could not do so , without comparing herself with miss larolles , the inimitable miss larolles ; but still she did it , and not with much happier effect ; though by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication in her next neighbours , she found herself at the very end of the bench before the concert closed .
austen	persuasion	such was her situation , with a vacant space at hand , when captain wentworth was again in sight . she saw him not far off . he saw her too ; yet he looked grave , and seemed irresolute , and only by very slow degrees came at last near enough to speak to her . she felt that something must be the matter . the change was indubitable . the difference between his present air and what it had been in the octagon room was strikingly great . why was it ? she thought of her father , of lady russell . could there have been any unpleasant glances ? he began by speaking of the concert gravely , more like the captain wentworth of uppercross ; owned himself disappointed , had expected singing ; and in short , must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over . anne replied , and spoke in defence of the performance so well , and yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly , that his countenance improved , and he replied again with almost a smile . they talked for a few minutes more ; the improvement held ; he even looked down towards the bench , as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying ; when at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged anne to turn round . it came from mr elliot . he begged her pardon , but she must be applied to , to explain italian again . miss carteret was very anxious to have a general idea of what was next to be sung . anne could not refuse ; but never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit .
austen	persuasion	a few minutes , though as few as possible , were inevitably consumed ; and when her own mistress again , when able to turn and look as she had done before , she found herself accosted by captain wentworth , in a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell . “ he must wish her good night ; he was going ; he should get home as fast as he could . ”
austen	persuasion	“ is not this song worth staying for ? ” said anne , suddenly struck by an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging . “ no ! ” he replied impressively , “ there is nothing worth my staying for ; ” and he was gone directly .
austen	persuasion	jealousy of mr elliot ! it was the only intelligible motive . captain wentworth jealous of her affection ! could she have believed it a week ago ; three hours ago ! for a moment the gratification was exquisite . but , alas ! there were very different thoughts to succeed . how was such jealousy to be quieted ? how was the truth to reach him ? how , in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations , would he ever learn of her real sentiments ? it was misery to think of mr elliot ’ s attentions . their evil was incalculable .
austen	persuasion	chapter xxi . anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise of going to mrs smith , meaning that it should engage her from home at the time when mr elliot would be most likely to call ; for to avoid mr elliot was almost a first object .
austen	persuasion	she felt a great deal of good-will towards him . in spite of the mischief of his attentions , she owed him gratitude and regard , perhaps compassion . she could not help thinking much of the extraordinary circumstances attending their acquaintance , of the right which he seemed to have to interest her , by everything in situation , by his own sentiments , by his early prepossession . it was altogether very extraordinary ; flattering , but painful . there was much to regret . how she might have felt had there been no captain wentworth in the case , was not worth enquiry ; for there was a captain wentworth ; and be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad , her affection would be his for ever . their union , she believed , could not divide her more from other men , than their final separation .
austen	persuasion	prettier musings of high-wrought love and eternal constancy , could never have passed along the streets of bath , than anne was sporting with from camden place to westgate buildings . it was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way .
austen	persuasion	she was sure of a pleasant reception ; and her friend seemed this morning particularly obliged to her for coming , seemed hardly to have expected her , though it had been an appointment .
austen	persuasion	an account of the concert was immediately claimed ; and anne ’ s recollections of the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features and make her rejoice to talk of it . all that she could tell she told most gladly , but the all was little for one who had been there , and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as mrs smith , who had already heard , through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter , rather more of the general success and produce of the evening than anne could relate , and who now asked in vain for several particulars of the company . everybody of any consequence or notoriety in bath was well know by name to mrs smith .
austen	persuasion	“ the little durands were there , i conclude , ” said she , “ with their mouths open to catch the music , like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed . they never miss a concert. ” “ yes ; i did not see them myself , but i heard mr elliot say they were in the room . ”
austen	persuasion	“ the ibbotsons , were they there ? and the two new beauties , with the tall irish officer , who is talked of for one of them. ” “ i do not know . i do not think they were . ”
austen	persuasion	“ old lady mary maclean ? i need not ask after her . she never misses , i know ; and you must have seen her . she must have been in your own circle ; for as you went with lady dalrymple , you were in the seats of grandeur , round the orchestra , of course . ”
austen	persuasion	“ no , that was what i dreaded . it would have been very unpleasant to me in every respect . but happily lady dalrymple always chooses to be farther off ; and we were exceedingly well placed , that is , for hearing ; i must not say for seeing , because i appear to have seen very little . ”
austen	persuasion	“ oh ! you saw enough for your own amusement . i can understand . there is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd , and this you had . you were a large party in yourselves , and you wanted nothing beyond . ”
austen	persuasion	“ but i ought to have looked about me more , ” said anne , conscious while she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about , that the object only had been deficient .
austen	persuasion	“ no , no ; you were better employed . you need not tell me that you had a pleasant evening . i see it in your eye . i perfectly see how the hours passed : that you had always something agreeable to listen to . in the intervals of the concert it was conversation . ”
austen	persuasion	anne half smiled and said , “ do you see that in my eye ? ” “ yes , i do . your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in the world , the person who interests you at this present time more than all the rest of the world put together . ”
austen	persuasion	a blush overspread anne ’ s cheeks . she could say nothing . “ and such being the case , ” continued mrs smith , after a short pause , “ i hope you believe that i do know how to value your kindness in coming to me this morning . it is really very good of you to come and sit with me , when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your time . ”
austen	persuasion	anne heard nothing of this . she was still in the astonishment and confusion excited by her friend ’ s penetration , unable to imagine how any report of captain wentworth could have reached her . after another short silence—
austen	persuasion	“ pray , ” said mrs smith , “ is mr elliot aware of your acquaintance with me ? does he know that i am in bath ? ” “ mr elliot ! ” repeated anne , looking up surprised . a moment ’ s reflection shewed her the mistake she had been under . she caught it instantaneously ; and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety , soon added , more composedly , “ are you acquainted with mr elliot ? ”
austen	persuasion	“ i have been a good deal acquainted with him , ” replied mrs smith , gravely , “ but it seems worn out now . it is a great while since we met. ” “ i was not at all aware of this . you never mentioned it before . had i known it , i would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you . ”
austen	persuasion	“ to confess the truth , ” said mrs smith , assuming her usual air of cheerfulness , “ that is exactly the pleasure i want you to have . i want you to talk about me to mr elliot . i want your interest with him . he can be of essential service to me ; and if you would have the goodness , my dear miss elliot , to make it an object to yourself , of course it is done . ”
austen	persuasion	“ i should be extremely happy ; i hope you can not doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you , ” replied anne ; “ but i suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on mr elliot , a greater right to influence him , than is really the case . i am sure you have , somehow or other , imbibed such a notion . you must consider me only as mr elliot ’ s relation . if in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him , i beg you would not hesitate to employ me . ”
austen	persuasion	mrs smith gave her a penetrating glance , and then , smiling , said— “ i have been a little premature , i perceive ; i beg your pardon . i ought to have waited for official information . but now , my dear miss elliot , as an old friend , do give me a hint as to when i may speak . next week ? to be sure by next week i may be allowed to think it all settled , and build my own selfish schemes on mr elliot ’ s good fortune . ”
austen	persuasion	“ no , ” replied anne , “ nor next week , nor next , nor next . i assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week . i am not going to marry mr elliot . i should like to know why you imagine i am ? ”
austen	persuasion	mrs smith looked at her again , looked earnestly , smiled , shook her head , and exclaimed— “ now , how i do wish i understood you ! how i do wish i knew what you were at ! i have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel , when the right moment occurs . till it does come , you know , we women never mean to have anybody . it is a thing of course among us , that every man is refused , till he offers . but why should you be cruel ? let me plead for my—present friend i can not call him , but for my former friend . where can you look for a more suitable match ? where could you expect a more gentlemanlike , agreeable man ? let me recommend mr elliot . i am sure you hear nothing but good of him from colonel wallis ; and who can know him better than colonel wallis ? ”
austen	persuasion	“ my dear mrs smith , mr elliot ’ s wife has not been dead much above half a year . he ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses to any one . ”
austen	persuasion	“ oh ! if these are your only objections , ” cried mrs smith , archly , “ mr elliot is safe , and i shall give myself no more trouble about him . do not forget me when you are married , that ’ s all . let him know me to be a friend of yours , and then he will think little of the trouble required , which it is very natural for him now , with so many affairs and engagements of his own , to avoid and get rid of as he can ; very natural , perhaps . ninety-nine out of a hundred would do the same . of course , he can not be aware of the importance to me . well , my dear miss elliot , i hope and trust you will be very happy . mr elliot has sense to understand the value of such a woman . your peace will not be shipwrecked as mine has been . you are safe in all worldly matters , and safe in his character . he will not be led astray ; he will not be misled by others to his ruin . ”
austen	persuasion	“ no , ” said anne , “ i can readily believe all that of my cousin . he seems to have a calm decided temper , not at all open to dangerous impressions . i consider him with great respect . i have no reason , from any thing that has fallen within my observation , to do otherwise . but i have not known him long ; and he is not a man , i think , to be known intimately soon . will not this manner of speaking of him , mrs smith , convince you that he is nothing to me ? surely this must be calm enough . and , upon my word , he is nothing to me . should he ever propose to me ( which i have very little reason to imagine he has any thought of doing ) , i shall not accept him . i assure you i shall not . i assure you , mr elliot had not the share which you have been supposing , in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford : not mr elliot ; it is not mr elliot that— ”
austen	persuasion	she stopped , regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much ; but less would hardly have been sufficient . mrs smith would hardly have believed so soon in mr elliot ’ s failure , but from the perception of there being a somebody else . as it was , she instantly submitted , and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond ; and anne , eager to escape farther notice , was impatient to know why mrs smith should have fancied she was to marry mr elliot ; where she could have received the idea , or from whom she could have heard it .
austen	persuasion	“ do tell me how it first came into your head. ” “ it first came into my head , ” replied mrs smith , “ upon finding how much you were together , and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you ; and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in the same way . but i never heard it spoken of till two days ago . ”
austen	persuasion	“ and has it indeed been spoken of ? ” “ did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when you called yesterday ? ” “ no . was not it mrs speed , as usual , or the maid ? i observed no one in particular . ”
austen	persuasion	“ it was my friend mrs rooke ; nurse rooke ; who , by-the-bye , had a great curiosity to see you , and was delighted to be in the way to let you in . she came away from marlborough buildings only on sunday ; and she it was who told me you were to marry mr elliot . she had had it from mrs wallis herself , which did not seem bad authority . she sat an hour with me on monday evening , and gave me the whole history. ” “ the whole history , ” repeated anne , laughing . “ she could not make a very long history , i think , of one such little article of unfounded news . ”
austen	persuasion	mrs smith said nothing . “ but , ” continued anne , presently , “ though there is no truth in my having this claim on mr elliot , i should be extremely happy to be of use to you in any way that i could . shall i mention to him your being in bath ? shall i take any message ? ”
austen	persuasion	“ no , i thank you : no , certainly not . in the warmth of the moment , and under a mistaken impression , i might , perhaps , have endeavoured to interest you in some circumstances ; but not now . no , i thank you , i have nothing to trouble you with . ”
austen	persuasion	“ i think you spoke of having known mr elliot many years ? ” “ i did. ” “ not before he was married , i suppose ? ” “ yes ; he was not married when i knew him first . ”
austen	persuasion	“ and—were you much acquainted ? ” “ intimately. ” “ indeed ! then do tell me what he was at that time of life . i have a great curiosity to know what mr elliot was as a very young man . was he at all such as he appears now ? ”
austen	persuasion	“ i have not seen mr elliot these three years , ” was mrs smith ’ s answer , given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther ; and anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity . they were both silent : mrs smith very thoughtful . at last—
austen	persuasion	“ i beg your pardon , my dear miss elliot , ” she cried , in her natural tone of cordiality , “ i beg your pardon for the short answers i have been giving you , but i have been uncertain what i ought to do . i have been doubting and considering as to what i ought to tell you . there were many things to be taken into the account . one hates to be officious , to be giving bad impressions , making mischief . even the smooth surface of family-union seems worth preserving , though there may be nothing durable beneath . however , i have determined ; i think i am right ; i think you ought to be made acquainted with mr elliot ’ s real character . though i fully believe that , at present , you have not the smallest intention of accepting him , there is no saying what may happen . you might , some time or other , be differently affected towards him . hear the truth , therefore , now , while you are unprejudiced . mr elliot is a man without heart or conscience ; a designing , wary , cold-blooded being , who thinks only of himself ; whom for his own interest or ease , would be guilty of any cruelty , or any treachery , that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character . he has no feeling for others . those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin , he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction . he is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion . oh ! he is black at heart , hollow and black ! ”
austen	persuasion	anne ’ s astonished air , and exclamation of wonder , made her pause , and in a calmer manner , she added , “ my expressions startle you . you must allow for an injured , angry woman . but i will try to command myself . i will not abuse him . i will only tell you what i have found him . facts shall speak . he was the intimate friend of my dear husband , who trusted and loved him , and thought him as good as himself . the intimacy had been formed before our marriage . i found them most intimate friends ; and i , too , became excessively pleased with mr elliot , and entertained the highest opinion of him . at nineteen , you know , one does not think very seriously ; but mr elliot appeared to me quite as good as others , and much more agreeable than most others , and we were almost always together . we were principally in town , living in very good style . he was then the inferior in circumstances ; he was then the poor one ; he had chambers in the temple , and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman . he had always a home with us whenever he chose it ; he was always welcome ; he was like a brother . my poor charles , who had the finest , most generous spirit in the world , would have divided his last farthing with him ; and i know that his purse was open to him ; i know that he often assisted him . ”
austen	persuasion	“ this must have been about that very period of mr elliot ’ s life , ” said anne , “ which has always excited my particular curiosity . it must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister . i never knew him myself ; i only heard of him ; but there was a something in his conduct then , with regard to my father and sister , and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage , which i never could quite reconcile with present times . it seemed to announce a different sort of man . ”
austen	persuasion	“ i know it all , i know it all , ” cried mrs smith . “ he had been introduced to sir walter and your sister before i was acquainted with him , but i heard him speak of them for ever . i know he was invited and encouraged , and i know he did not choose to go . i can satisfy you , perhaps , on points which you would little expect ; and as to his marriage , i knew all about it at the time . i was privy to all the fors and againsts ; i was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans ; and though i did not know his wife previously , her inferior situation in society , indeed , rendered that impossible , yet i knew her all her life afterwards , or at least till within the last two years of her life , and can answer any question you may wish to put . ”
austen	persuasion	“ nay , ” said anne , “ i have no particular enquiry to make about her . i have always understood they were not a happy couple . but i should like to know why , at that time of his life , he should slight my father ’ s acquaintance as he did . my father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him . why did mr elliot draw back ? ”
austen	persuasion	“ mr elliot , ” replied mrs smith , “ at that period of his life , had one object in view : to make his fortune , and by a rather quicker process than the law . he was determined to make it by marriage . he was determined , at least , not to mar it by an imprudent marriage ; and i know it was his belief ( whether justly or not , of course i can not decide ) , that your father and sister , in their civilities and invitations , were designing a match between the heir and the young lady , and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence . that was his motive for drawing back , i can assure you . he told me the whole story . he had no concealments with me . it was curious , that having just left you behind me in bath , my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin ; and that , through him , i should be continually hearing of your father and sister . he described one miss elliot , and i thought very affectionately of the other . ”
austen	persuasion	“ perhaps , ” cried anne , struck by a sudden idea , “ you sometimes spoke of me to mr elliot ? ” “ to be sure i did ; very often . i used to boast of my own anne elliot , and vouch for your being a very different creature from— ”
austen	persuasion	she checked herself just in time . “ this accounts for something which mr elliot said last night , ” cried anne . “ this explains it . i found he had been used to hear of me . i could not comprehend how . what wild imaginations one forms where dear self is concerned ! how sure to be mistaken ! but i beg your pardon ; i have interrupted you . mr elliot married then completely for money ? the circumstances , probably , which first opened your eyes to his character . ”
austen	persuasion	mrs smith hesitated a little here . “ oh ! those things are too common . when one lives in the world , a man or woman ’ s marrying for money is too common to strike one as it ought . i was very young , and associated only with the young , and we were a thoughtless , gay set , without any strict rules of conduct . we lived for enjoyment . i think differently now ; time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions ; but at that period i must own i saw nothing reprehensible in what mr elliot was doing . ‘ to do the best for himself , ’ passed as a duty . ”
austen	persuasion	“ but was not she a very low woman ? ” “ yes ; which i objected to , but he would not regard . money , money , was all that he wanted . her father was a grazier , her grandfather had been a butcher , but that was all nothing . she was a fine woman , had had a decent education , was brought forward by some cousins , thrown by chance into mr elliot ’ s company , and fell in love with him ; and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side , with respect to her birth . all his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount of her fortune , before he committed himself . depend upon it , whatever esteem mr elliot may have for his own situation in life now , as a young man he had not the smallest value for it . his chance for the kellynch estate was something , but all the honour of the family he held as cheap as dirt . i have often heard him declare , that if baronetcies were saleable , anybody should have his for fifty pounds , arms and motto , name and livery included ; but i will not pretend to repeat half that i used to hear him say on that subject . it would not be fair ; and yet you ought to have proof , for what is all this but assertion , and you shall have proof . ”
austen	persuasion	“ indeed , my dear mrs smith , i want none , ” cried anne . “ you have asserted nothing contradictory to what mr elliot appeared to be some years ago . this is all in confirmation , rather , of what we used to hear and believe . i am more curious to know why he should be so different now . ”
austen	persuasion	“ but for my satisfaction , if you will have the goodness to ring for mary ; stay : i am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom , and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet . ”
austen	persuasion	anne , seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it , did as she was desired . the box was brought and placed before her , and mrs smith , sighing over it as she unlocked it , said—
austen	persuasion	“ this is full of papers belonging to him , to my husband ; a small portion only of what i had to look over when i lost him . the letter i am looking for was one written by mr elliot to him before our marriage , and happened to be saved ; why , one can hardly imagine . but he was careless and immethodical , like other men , about those things ; and when i came to examine his papers , i found it with others still more trivial , from different people scattered here and there , while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed . here it is ; i would not burn it , because being even then very little satisfied with mr elliot , i was determined to preserve every document of former intimacy . i have now another motive for being glad that i can produce it . ”
austen	persuasion	this was the letter , directed to “ charles smith , esq . tunbridge wells , ” and dated from london , as far back as july , 1803 : — “ dear smith , “ i have received yours . your kindness almost overpowers me . i wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common , but i have lived three-and-twenty years in the world , and have seen none like it . at present , believe me , i have no need of your services , being in cash again . give me joy : i have got rid of sir walter and miss . they are gone back to kellynch , and almost made me swear to visit them this summer ; but my first visit to kellynch will be with a surveyor , to tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer . the baronet , nevertheless , is not unlikely to marry again ; he is quite fool enough . if he does , however , they will leave me in peace , which may be a decent equivalent for the reversion . he is worse than last year .
austen	persuasion	“ i wish i had any name but elliot . i am sick of it . the name of walter i can drop , thank god ! and i desire you will never insult me with my second w. again , meaning , for the rest of my life , to be only yours truly ,
austen	persuasion	“ wm . elliot. ” such a letter could not be read without putting anne in a glow ; and mrs smith , observing the high colour in her face , said— “ the language , i know , is highly disrespectful . though i have forgot the exact terms , i have a perfect impression of the general meaning . but it shows you the man . mark his professions to my poor husband . can any thing be stronger ? ”
austen	persuasion	anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of finding such words applied to her father . she was obliged to recollect that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour , that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies , that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others , before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter which she had been meditating over , and say—
austen	persuasion	“ thank you . this is full proof undoubtedly ; proof of every thing you were saying . but why be acquainted with us now ? ” “ i can explain this too , ” cried mrs smith , smiling .
austen	persuasion	“ can you really ? ” “ yes . i have shewn you mr elliot as he was a dozen years ago , and i will shew him as he is now . i can not produce written proof again , but i can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire , of what he is now wanting , and what he is now doing . he is no hypocrite now . he truly wants to marry you . his present attentions to your family are very sincere : quite from the heart . i will give you my authority : his friend colonel wallis . ”
austen	persuasion	“ colonel wallis ! you are acquainted with him ? ” “ no . it does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that ; it takes a bend or two , but nothing of consequence . the stream is as good as at first ; the little rubbish it collects in the turnings is easily moved away . mr elliot talks unreservedly to colonel wallis of his views on you , which said colonel wallis , i imagine to be , in himself , a sensible , careful , discerning sort of character ; but colonel wallis has a very pretty silly wife , to whom he tells things which he had better not , and he repeats it all to her . she in the overflowing spirits of her recovery , repeats it all to her nurse ; and the nurse knowing my acquaintance with you , very naturally brings it all to me . on monday evening , my good friend mrs rooke let me thus much into the secrets of marlborough buildings . when i talked of a whole history , therefore , you see i was not romancing so much as you supposed . ”
austen	persuasion	“ my dear mrs smith , your authority is deficient . this will not do . mr elliot ’ s having any views on me will not in the least account for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father . that was all prior to my coming to bath . i found them on the most friendly terms when i arrived . ”
austen	persuasion	“ i know you did ; i know it all perfectly , but— ” “ indeed , mrs smith , we must not expect to get real information in such a line . facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so many , to be misconceived by folly in one , and ignorance in another , can hardly have much truth left . ”
austen	persuasion	“ only give me a hearing . you will soon be able to judge of the general credit due , by listening to some particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm . nobody supposes that you were his first inducement . he had seen you indeed , before he came to bath , and admired you , but without knowing it to be you . so says my historian , at least . is this true ? did he see you last summer or autumn , ‘ somewhere down in the west , ’ to use her own words , without knowing it to be you ? ”
austen	persuasion	“ he certainly did . so far it is very true . at lyme . i happened to be at lyme. ” “ well , ” continued mrs smith , triumphantly , “ grant my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first point asserted . he saw you then at lyme , and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in camden place , as miss anne elliot , and from that moment , i have no doubt , had a double motive in his visits there . but there was another , and an earlier , which i will now explain . if there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable , stop me . my account states , that your sister ’ s friend , the lady now staying with you , whom i have heard you mention , came to bath with miss elliot and sir walter as long ago as september ( in short when they first came themselves ) , and has been staying there ever since ; that she is a clever , insinuating , handsome woman , poor and plausible , and altogether such in situation and manner , as to give a general idea , among sir walter ’ s acquaintance , of her meaning to be lady elliot , and as general a surprise that miss elliot should be apparently , blind to the danger . ”
austen	persuasion	here mrs smith paused a moment ; but anne had not a word to say , and she continued— “ this was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family , long before you returned to it ; and colonel wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it , though he did not then visit in camden place ; but his regard for mr elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there , and when mr elliot came to bath for a day or two , as he happened to do a little before christmas , colonel wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things , and the reports beginning to prevail . now you are to understand , that time had worked a very material change in mr elliot ’ s opinions as to the value of a baronetcy . upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man . having long had as much money as he could spend , nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence , he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to . i thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased , but it is now a confirmed feeling . he can not bear the idea of not being sir william . you may guess , therefore , that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable , and you may guess what it produced ; the resolution of coming back to bath as soon as possible , and of fixing himself here for a time , with the view of renewing his former acquaintance , and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger , and of circumventing the lady if he found it material . this was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done ; and colonel wallis was to assist in every way that he could . he was to be introduced , and mrs wallis was to be introduced , and everybody was to be introduced . mr elliot came back accordingly ; and on application was forgiven , as you know , and re-admitted into the family ; and there it was his constant object , and his only object ( till your arrival added another motive ) , to watch sir walter and mrs clay . he omitted no opportunity of being with them , threw himself in their way , called at all hours ; but i need not be particular on this subject . you can imagine what an artful man would do ; and with this guide , perhaps , may recollect what you have seen him do . ”
austen	persuasion	“ yes , ” said anne , “ you tell me nothing which does not accord with what i have known , or could imagine . there is always something offensive in the details of cunning . the manœuvres of selfishness and duplicity must ever be revolting , but i have heard nothing which really surprises me . i know those who would be shocked by such a representation of mr elliot , who would have difficulty in believing it ; but i have never been satisfied . i have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared . i should like to know his present opinion , as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of ; whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not . ”
austen	persuasion	“ lessening , i understand , ” replied mrs smith . “ he thinks mrs clay afraid of him , aware that he sees through her , and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence . but since he must be absent some time or other , i do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence . mrs wallis has an amusing idea , as nurse tells me , that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and mr elliot marry , that your father is not to marry mrs clay . a scheme , worthy of mrs wallis ’ s understanding , by all accounts ; but my sensible nurse rooke sees the absurdity of it . ‘ why , to be sure , ma ’ am , ’ said she , ‘ it would not prevent his marrying anybody else. ’ and , indeed , to own the truth , i do not think nurse , in her heart , is a very strenuous opposer of sir walter ’ s making a second match . she must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony , you know ; and ( since self will intrude ) who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next lady elliot , through mrs wallis ’ s recommendation ? ”
austen	persuasion	“ i am very glad to know all this , ” said anne , after a little thoughtfulness . “ it will be more painful to me in some respects to be in company with him , but i shall know better what to do . my line of conduct will be more direct . mr elliot is evidently a disingenuous , artificial , worldly man , who has never had any better principle to guide him than selfishness . ”
austen	persuasion	but mr elliot was not done with . mrs smith had been carried away from her first direction , and anne had forgotten , in the interest of her own family concerns , how much had been originally implied against him ; but her attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints , and she listened to a recital which , if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of mrs smith , proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her ; very deficient both in justice and compassion .
austen	persuasion	she learned that ( the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by mr elliot ’ s marriage ) they had been as before always together , and mr elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune . mrs smith did not want to take blame to herself , and was most tender of throwing any on her husband ; but anne could collect that their income had never been equal to their style of living , and that from the first there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance . from his wife ’ s account of him she could discern mr smith to have been a man of warm feelings , easy temper , careless habits , and not strong understanding , much more amiable than his friend , and very unlike him , led by him , and probably despised by him . mr elliot , raised by his marriage to great affluence , and disposed to every gratification of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself , ( for with all his self-indulgence he had become a prudent man ) , and beginning to be rich , just as his friend ought to have found himself to be poor , seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend ’ s probable finances , but , on the contrary , had been prompting and encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin ; and the smiths accordingly had been ruined .
austen	persuasion	the husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it . they had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship of their friends , and to prove that mr elliot ’ s had better not be tried ; but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs was fully known . with a confidence in mr elliot ’ s regard , more creditable to his feelings than his judgement , mr smith had appointed him the executor of his will ; but mr elliot would not act , and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her , in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation , had been such as could not be related without anguish of spirit , or listened to without corresponding indignation .
austen	persuasion	anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion , answers to urgent applications from mrs smith , which all breathed the same stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble , and , under a cold civility , the same hard-hearted indifference to any of the evils it might bring on her . it was a dreadful picture of ingratitude and inhumanity ; and anne felt , at some moments , that no flagrant open crime could have been worse . she had a great deal to listen to ; all the particulars of past sad scenes , all the minutiae of distress upon distress , which in former conversations had been merely hinted at , were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence . anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief , and was only the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend ’ s usual state of mind .
austen	persuasion	there was one circumstance in the history of her grievances of particular irritation . she had good reason to believe that some property of her husband in the west indies , which had been for many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment of its own incumbrances , might be recoverable by proper measures ; and this property , though not large , would be enough to make her comparatively rich . but there was nobody to stir in it . mr elliot would do nothing , and she could do nothing herself , equally disabled from personal exertion by her state of bodily weakness , and from employing others by her want of money . she had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel , and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law . this was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means . to feel that she ought to be in better circumstances , that a little trouble in the right place might do it , and to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims , was hard to bear .
austen	persuasion	it was on this point that she had hoped to engage anne ’ s good offices with mr elliot . she had previously , in the anticipation of their marriage , been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it ; but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature , since he did not even know her to be in bath , it immediately occurred , that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman he loved , and she had been hastily preparing to interest anne ’ s feelings , as far as the observances due to mr elliot ’ s character would allow , when anne ’ s refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of everything ; and while it took from her the new-formed hope of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety , left her at least the comfort of telling the whole story her own way .
austen	persuasion	after listening to this full description of mr elliot , anne could not but express some surprise at mrs smith ’ s having spoken of him so favourably in the beginning of their conversation . “ she had seemed to recommend and praise him ! ”
austen	persuasion	“ my dear , ” was mrs smith ’ s reply , “ there was nothing else to be done . i considered your marrying him as certain , though he might not yet have made the offer , and i could no more speak the truth of him , than if he had been your husband . my heart bled for you , as i talked of happiness ; and yet he is sensible , he is agreeable , and with such a woman as you , it was not absolutely hopeless . he was very unkind to his first wife . they were wretched together . but she was too ignorant and giddy for respect , and he had never loved her . i was willing to hope that you must fare better . ”
austen	persuasion	anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having been induced to marry him , as made her shudder at the idea of the misery which must have followed . it was just possible that she might have been persuaded by lady russell ! and under such a supposition , which would have been most miserable , when time had disclosed all , too late ?
austen	persuasion	it was very desirable that lady russell should be no longer deceived ; and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference , which carried them through the greater part of the morning , was , that anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend everything relative to mrs smith , in which his conduct was involved .
austen	persuasion	chapter xxii . anne went home to think over all that she had heard . in one point , her feelings were relieved by this knowledge of mr elliot . there was no longer anything of tenderness due to him . he stood as opposed to captain wentworth , in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness ; and the evil of his attentions last night , the irremediable mischief he might have done , was considered with sensations unqualified , unperplexed . pity for him was all over . but this was the only point of relief . in every other respect , in looking around her , or penetrating forward , she saw more to distrust and to apprehend . she was concerned for the disappointment and pain lady russell would be feeling ; for the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister , and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils , without knowing how to avert any one of them . she was most thankful for her own knowledge of him . she had never considered herself as entitled to reward for not slighting an old friend like mrs smith , but here was a reward indeed springing from it ! mrs smith had been able to tell her what no one else could have done . could the knowledge have been extended through her family ? but this was a vain idea . she must talk to lady russell , tell her , consult with her , and having done her best , wait the event with as much composure as possible ; and after all , her greatest want of composure would be in that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to lady russell ; in that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself .
austen	persuasion	she found , on reaching home , that she had , as she intended , escaped seeing mr elliot ; that he had called and paid them a long morning visit ; but hardly had she congratulated herself , and felt safe , when she heard that he was coming again in the evening .
austen	persuasion	“ i had not the smallest intention of asking him , ” said elizabeth , with affected carelessness , “ but he gave so many hints ; so mrs clay says , at least. ” “ indeed , i do say it . i never saw anybody in my life spell harder for an invitation . poor man ! i was really in pain for him ; for your hard-hearted sister , miss anne , seems bent on cruelty . ”
austen	persuasion	“ oh ! ” cried elizabeth , “ i have been rather too much used to the game to be soon overcome by a gentleman ’ s hints . however , when i found how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this morning , i gave way immediately , for i would never really omit an opportunity of bringing him and sir walter together . they appear to so much advantage in company with each other . each behaving so pleasantly . mr elliot looking up with so much respect . ”
austen	persuasion	“ quite delightful ! ” cried mrs clay , not daring , however , to turn her eyes towards anne . “ exactly like father and son ! dear miss elliot , may i not say father and son ? ” “ oh ! i lay no embargo on any body ’ s words . if you will have such ideas ! but , upon my word , i am scarcely sensible of his attentions being beyond those of other men . ”
austen	persuasion	“ my dear miss elliot ! ” exclaimed mrs clay , lifting her hands and eyes , and sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence . “ well , my dear penelope , you need not be so alarmed about him . i did invite him , you know . i sent him away with smiles . when i found he was really going to his friends at thornberry park for the whole day to-morrow , i had compassion on him . ”
austen	persuasion	anne admired the good acting of the friend , in being able to shew such pleasure as she did , in the expectation and in the actual arrival of the very person whose presence must really be interfering with her prime object . it was impossible but that mrs clay must hate the sight of mr elliot ; and yet she could assume a most obliging , placid look , and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license of devoting herself only half as much to sir walter as she would have done otherwise .
austen	persuasion	to anne herself it was most distressing to see mr elliot enter the room ; and quite painful to have him approach and speak to her . she had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere , but now she saw insincerity in everything . his attentive deference to her father , contrasted with his former language , was odious ; and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards mrs smith , she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness , or the sound of his artificial good sentiments .
austen	persuasion	she meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke a remonstrance on his side . it was a great object to her to escape all enquiry or eclat ; but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool to him as might be compatible with their relationship ; and to retrace , as quietly as she could , the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had been gradually led along . she was accordingly more guarded , and more cool , than she had been the night before .
austen	persuasion	he wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where he could have heard her formerly praised ; wanted very much to be gratified by more solicitation ; but the charm was broken : he found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary to kindle his modest cousin ’ s vanity ; he found , at least , that it was not to be done now , by any of those attempts which he could hazard among the too-commanding claims of the others . he little surmised that it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest , bringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct which were least excusable .
austen	persuasion	she had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of bath the next morning , going early , and that he would be gone the greater part of two days . he was invited again to camden place the very evening of his return ; but from thursday to saturday evening his absence was certain . it was bad enough that a mrs clay should be always before her ; but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party , seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort . it was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised on her father and elizabeth ; to consider the various sources of mortification preparing for them ! mrs clay ’ s selfishness was not so complicate nor so revolting as his ; and anne would have compounded for the marriage at once , with all its evils , to be clear of mr elliot ’ s subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it .
austen	persuasion	on friday morning she meant to go very early to lady russell , and accomplish the necessary communication ; and she would have gone directly after breakfast , but that mrs clay was also going out on some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble , which determined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion . she saw mrs clay fairly off , therefore , before she began to talk of spending the morning in rivers street .
austen	persuasion	“ very well , ” said elizabeth , “ i have nothing to send but my love . oh ! you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me , and pretend i have read it through . i really can not be plaguing myself for ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out . lady russell quite bores one with her new publications . you need not tell her so , but i thought her dress hideous the other night . i used to think she had some taste in dress , but i was ashamed of her at the concert . something so formal and _arrangé_ in her air ! and she sits so upright ! my best love , of course . ”
austen	persuasion	“ and mine , ” added sir walter . “ kindest regards . and you may say , that i mean to call upon her soon . make a civil message ; but i shall only leave my card . morning visits are never fair by women at her time of life , who make themselves up so little . if she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen ; but last time i called , i observed the blinds were let down immediately . ”
austen	persuasion	while her father spoke , there was a knock at the door . who could it be ? anne , remembering the preconcerted visits , at all hours , of mr elliot , would have expected him , but for his known engagement seven miles off . after the usual period of suspense , the usual sounds of approach were heard , and “ mr and mrs charles musgrove ” were ushered into the room .
austen	persuasion	surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance ; but anne was really glad to see them ; and the others were not so sorry but that they could put on a decent air of welcome ; and as soon as it became clear that these , their nearest relations , were not arrived with any views of accommodation in that house , sir walter and elizabeth were able to rise in cordiality , and do the honours of it very well . they were come to bath for a few days with mrs musgrove , and were at the white hart . so much was pretty soon understood ; but till sir walter and elizabeth were walking mary into the other drawing-room , and regaling themselves with her admiration , anne could not draw upon charles ’ s brain for a regular history of their coming , or an explanation of some smiling hints of particular business , which had been ostentatiously dropped by mary , as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of .
austen	persuasion	she then found that it consisted of mrs musgrove , henrietta , and captain harville , beside their two selves . he gave her a very plain , intelligible account of the whole ; a narration in which she saw a great deal of most characteristic proceeding . the scheme had received its first impulse by captain harville ’ s wanting to come to bath on business . he had begun to talk of it a week ago ; and by way of doing something , as shooting was over , charles had proposed coming with him , and mrs harville had seemed to like the idea of it very much , as an advantage to her husband ; but mary could not bear to be left , and had made herself so unhappy about it , that for a day or two everything seemed to be in suspense , or at an end . but then , it had been taken up by his father and mother . his mother had some old friends in bath whom she wanted to see ; it was thought a good opportunity for henrietta to come and buy wedding-clothes for herself and her sister ; and , in short , it ended in being his mother ’ s party , that everything might be comfortable and easy to captain harville ; and he and mary were included in it by way of general convenience . they had arrived late the night before . mrs harville , her children , and captain benwick , remained with mr musgrove and louisa at uppercross .
austen	persuasion	anne ’ s only surprise was , that affairs should be in forwardness enough for henrietta ’ s wedding-clothes to be talked of . she had imagined such difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent the marriage from being near at hand ; but she learned from charles that , very recently , ( since mary ’ s last letter to herself ) , charles hayter had been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth who could not possibly claim it under many years ; and that on the strength of his present income , with almost a certainty of something more permanent long before the term in question , the two families had consented to the young people ’ s wishes , and that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months , quite as soon as louisa ’ s . “ and a very good living it was , ” charles added : “ only five-and-twenty miles from uppercross , and in a very fine country : fine part of dorsetshire . in the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom , surrounded by three great proprietors , each more careful and jealous than the other ; and to two of the three at least , charles hayter might get a special recommendation . not that he will value it as he ought , ” he observed , “ charles is too cool about sporting . that ’ s the worst of him . ”
austen	persuasion	“ i am extremely glad , indeed , ” cried anne , “ particularly glad that this should happen ; and that of two sisters , who both deserve equally well , and who have always been such good friends , the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other—that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort . i hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both . ”
austen	persuasion	“ oh ! yes . my father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer , but he has no other fault to find . money , you know , coming down with money—two daughters at once—it can not be a very agreeable operation , and it streightens him as to many things . however , i do not mean to say they have not a right to it . it is very fit they should have daughters ’ shares ; and i am sure he has always been a very kind , liberal father to me . mary does not above half like henrietta ’ s match . she never did , you know . but she does not do him justice , nor think enough about winthrop . i can not make her attend to the value of the property . it is a very fair match , as times go ; and i have liked charles hayter all my life , and i shall not leave off now . ”
austen	persuasion	“ such excellent parents as mr and mrs musgrove , ” exclaimed anne , “ should be happy in their children ’ s marriages . they do everything to confer happiness , i am sure . what a blessing to young people to be in such hands ! your father and mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery , both in young and old . i hope you think louisa perfectly recovered now ? ”
austen	persuasion	he answered rather hesitatingly , “ yes , i believe i do ; very much recovered ; but she is altered ; there is no running or jumping about , no laughing or dancing ; it is quite different . if one happens only to shut the door a little hard , she starts and wriggles like a young dab-chick in the water ; and benwick sits at her elbow , reading verses , or whispering to her , all day long . ”
austen	persuasion	anne could not help laughing . “ that can not be much to your taste , i know , ” said she ; “ but i do believe him to be an excellent young man. ” “ to be sure he is . nobody doubts it ; and i hope you do not think i am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and pleasures as myself . i have a great value for benwick ; and when one can but get him to talk , he has plenty to say . his reading has done him no harm , for he has fought as well as read . he is a brave fellow . i got more acquainted with him last monday than ever i did before . we had a famous set-to at rat-hunting all the morning in my father ’ s great barns ; and he played his part so well that i have liked him the better ever since . ”
austen	persuasion	here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of charles ’ s following the others to admire mirrors and china ; but anne had heard enough to understand the present state of uppercross , and rejoice in its happiness ; and though she sighed as she rejoiced , her sigh had none of the ill-will of envy in it . she would certainly have risen to their blessings if she could , but she did not want to lessen theirs .
austen	persuasion	the visit passed off altogether in high good humour . mary was in excellent spirits , enjoying the gaiety and the change , and so well satisfied with the journey in her mother-in-law ’ s carriage with four horses , and with her own complete independence of camden place , that she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought , and enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house , as they were detailed to her . she had no demands on her father or sister , and her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome drawing-rooms .
austen	persuasion	elizabeth was , for a short time , suffering a good deal . she felt that mrs musgrove and all her party ought to be asked to dine with them ; but she could not bear to have the difference of style , the reduction of servants , which a dinner must betray , witnessed by those who had been always so inferior to the elliots of kellynch . it was a struggle between propriety and vanity ; but vanity got the better , and then elizabeth was happy again . these were her internal persuasions : “ old fashioned notions ; country hospitality ; we do not profess to give dinners ; few people in bath do ; lady alicia never does ; did not even ask her own sister ’ s family , though they were here a month : and i dare say it would be very inconvenient to mrs musgrove ; put her quite out of her way . i am sure she would rather not come ; she can not feel easy with us . i will ask them all for an evening ; that will be much better ; that will be a novelty and a treat . they have not seen two such drawing rooms before . they will be delighted to come to-morrow evening . it shall be a regular party , small , but most elegant. ” and this satisfied elizabeth : and when the invitation was given to the two present , and promised for the absent , mary was as completely satisfied . she was particularly asked to meet mr elliot , and be introduced to lady dalrymple and miss carteret , who were fortunately already engaged to come ; and she could not have received a more gratifying attention . miss elliot was to have the honour of calling on mrs musgrove in the course of the morning ; and anne walked off with charles and mary , to go and see her and henrietta directly .
austen	persuasion	her plan of sitting with lady russell must give way for the present . they all three called in rivers street for a couple of minutes ; but anne convinced herself that a day ’ s delay of the intended communication could be of no consequence , and hastened forward to the white hart , to see again the friends and companions of the last autumn , with an eagerness of good-will which many associations contributed to form .
austen	persuasion	they found mrs musgrove and her daughter within , and by themselves , and anne had the kindest welcome from each . henrietta was exactly in that state of recently-improved views , of fresh-formed happiness , which made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had ever liked before at all ; and mrs musgrove ’ s real affection had been won by her usefulness when they were in distress . it was a heartiness , and a warmth , and a sincerity which anne delighted in the more , from the sad want of such blessings at home . she was entreated to give them as much of her time as possible , invited for every day and all day long , or rather claimed as part of the family ; and , in return , she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance , and on charles ’ s leaving them together , was listening to mrs musgrove ’ s history of louisa , and to henrietta ’ s of herself , giving opinions on business , and recommendations to shops ; with intervals of every help which mary required , from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts ; from finding her keys , and assorting her trinkets , to trying to convince her that she was not ill-used by anybody ; which mary , well amused as she generally was , in her station at a window overlooking the entrance to the pump room , could not but have her moments of imagining .
austen	persuasion	a morning of thorough confusion was to be expected . a large party in an hotel ensured a quick-changing , unsettled scene . one five minutes brought a note , the next a parcel ; and anne had not been there half an hour , when their dining-room , spacious as it was , seemed more than half filled : a party of steady old friends were seated around mrs musgrove , and charles came back with captains harville and wentworth . the appearance of the latter could not be more than the surprise of the moment . it was impossible for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together again . their last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings ; she had derived from it a delightful conviction ; but she feared from his looks , that the same unfortunate persuasion , which had hastened him away from the concert room , still governed . he did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation .
austen	persuasion	she tried to be calm , and leave things to take their course , and tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence : — “ surely , if there be constant attachment on each side , our hearts must understand each other ere long . we are not boy and girl , to be captiously irritable , misled by every moment ’ s inadvertence , and wantonly playing with our own happiness. ” and yet , a few minutes afterwards , she felt as if their being in company with each other , under their present circumstances , could only be exposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most mischievous kind .
austen	persuasion	“ anne , ” cried mary , still at her window , “ there is mrs clay , i am sure , standing under the colonnade , and a gentleman with her . i saw them turn the corner from bath street just now . they seemed deep in talk . who is it ? come , and tell me . good heavens ! i recollect . it is mr elliot himself . ”
austen	persuasion	“ no , ” cried anne , quickly , “ it can not be mr elliot , i assure you . he was to leave bath at nine this morning , and does not come back till to-morrow. ” as she spoke , she felt that captain wentworth was looking at her , the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her , and made her regret that she had said so much , simple as it was .
austen	persuasion	mary , resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin , began talking very warmly about the family features , and protesting still more positively that it was mr elliot , calling again upon anne to come and look for herself , but anne did not mean to stir , and tried to be cool and unconcerned . her distress returned , however , on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between two or three of the lady visitors , as if they believed themselves quite in the secret . it was evident that the report concerning her had spread , and a short pause succeeded , which seemed to ensure that it would now spread farther .
austen	persuasion	“ do come , anne , ” cried mary , “ come and look yourself . you will be too late if you do not make haste . they are parting ; they are shaking hands . he is turning away . not know mr elliot , indeed ! you seem to have forgot all about lyme . ”
austen	persuasion	to pacify mary , and perhaps screen her own embarrassment , anne did move quietly to the window . she was just in time to ascertain that it really was mr elliot , which she had never believed , before he disappeared on one side , as mrs clay walked quickly off on the other ; and checking the surprise which she could not but feel at such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons of totally opposite interest , she calmly said , “ yes , it is mr elliot , certainly . he has changed his hour of going , i suppose , that is all , or i may be mistaken , i might not attend ; ” and walked back to her chair , recomposed , and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well .
austen	persuasion	the visitors took their leave ; and charles , having civilly seen them off , and then made a face at them , and abused them for coming , began with— “ well , mother , i have done something for you that you will like . i have been to the theatre , and secured a box for to-morrow night . a ’ n ’ t i a good boy ? i know you love a play ; and there is room for us all . it holds nine . i have engaged captain wentworth . anne will not be sorry to join us , i am sure . we all like a play . have not i done well , mother ? ”
austen	persuasion	mrs musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness for the play , if henrietta and all the others liked it , when mary eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming— “ good heavens , charles ! how can you think of such a thing ? take a box for to-morrow night ! have you forgot that we are engaged to camden place to-morrow night ? and that we were most particularly asked to meet lady dalrymple and her daughter , and mr elliot , and all the principal family connexions , on purpose to be introduced to them ? how can you be so forgetful ? ”
austen	persuasion	“ phoo ! phoo ! ” replied charles , “ what ’ s an evening party ? never worth remembering . your father might have asked us to dinner , i think , if he had wanted to see us . you may do as you like , but i shall go to the play . ”
austen	persuasion	“ oh ! charles , i declare it will be too abominable if you do , when you promised to go. ” “ no , i did not promise . i only smirked and bowed , and said the word ‘ happy. ’ there was no promise . ”
austen	persuasion	“ but you must go , charles . it would be unpardonable to fail . we were asked on purpose to be introduced . there was always such a great connexion between the dalrymples and ourselves . nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately . we are quite near relations , you know ; and mr elliot too , whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with ! every attention is due to mr elliot . consider , my father ’ s heir : the future representative of the family . ”
austen	persuasion	“ don ’ t talk to me about heirs and representatives , ” cried charles . “ i am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising sun . if i would not go for the sake of your father , i should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir . what is mr elliot to me ? ” the careless expression was life to anne , who saw that captain wentworth was all attention , looking and listening with his whole soul ; and that the last words brought his enquiring eyes from charles to herself .
austen	persuasion	charles and mary still talked on in the same style ; he , half serious and half jesting , maintaining the scheme for the play , and she , invariably serious , most warmly opposing it , and not omitting to make it known that , however determined to go to camden place herself , she should not think herself very well used , if they went to the play without her . mrs musgrove interposed .
austen	persuasion	“ we had better put it off . charles , you had much better go back and change the box for tuesday . it would be a pity to be divided , and we should be losing miss anne , too , if there is a party at her father ’ s ; and i am sure neither henrietta nor i should care at all for the play , if miss anne could not be with us . ”
austen	persuasion	anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness ; and quite as much so for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying— “ if it depended only on my inclination , ma ’ am , the party at home ( excepting on mary ’ s account ) would not be the smallest impediment . i have no pleasure in the sort of meeting , and should be too happy to change it for a play , and with you . but , it had better not be attempted , perhaps. ” she had spoken it ; but she trembled when it was done , conscious that her words were listened to , and daring not even to try to observe their effect .
austen	persuasion	it was soon generally agreed that tuesday should be the day ; charles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife , by persisting that he would go to the play to-morrow if nobody else would .
austen	persuasion	captain wentworth left his seat , and walked to the fire-place ; probably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards , and taking a station , with less bare-faced design , by anne .
austen	persuasion	“ you have not been long enough in bath , ” said he , “ to enjoy the evening parties of the place. ” “ oh ! no . the usual character of them has nothing for me . i am no card-player . ”
austen	persuasion	“ you were not formerly , i know . you did not use to like cards ; but time makes many changes. ” “ i am not yet so much changed , ” cried anne , and stopped , fearing she hardly knew what misconstruction . after waiting a few moments he said , and as if it were the result of immediate feeling , “ it is a period , indeed ! eight years and a half is a period . ”
austen	persuasion	whether he would have proceeded farther was left to anne ’ s imagination to ponder over in a calmer hour ; for while still hearing the sounds he had uttered , she was startled to other subjects by henrietta , eager to make use of the present leisure for getting out , and calling on her companions to lose no time , lest somebody else should come in .
austen	persuasion	they were obliged to move . anne talked of being perfectly ready , and tried to look it ; but she felt that could henrietta have known the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair , in preparing to quit the room , she would have found , in all her own sensations for her cousin , in the very security of his affection , wherewith to pity her .
austen	persuasion	their preparations , however , were stopped short . alarming sounds were heard ; other visitors approached , and the door was thrown open for sir walter and miss elliot , whose entrance seemed to give a general chill . anne felt an instant oppression , and wherever she looked saw symptoms of the same . the comfort , the freedom , the gaiety of the room was over , hushed into cold composure , determined silence , or insipid talk , to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister . how mortifying to feel that it was so !
austen	persuasion	her jealous eye was satisfied in one particular . captain wentworth was acknowledged again by each , by elizabeth more graciously than before . she even addressed him once , and looked at him more than once . elizabeth was , in fact , revolving a great measure . the sequel explained it . after the waste of a few minutes in saying the proper nothings , she began to give the invitation which was to comprise all the remaining dues of the musgroves . “ to-morrow evening , to meet a few friends : no formal party. ” it was all said very gracefully , and the cards with which she had provided herself , the “ miss elliot at home , ” were laid on the table , with a courteous , comprehensive smile to all , and one smile and one card more decidedly for captain wentworth . the truth was , that elizabeth had been long enough in bath to understand the importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his . the past was nothing . the present was that captain wentworth would move about well in her drawing-room . the card was pointedly given , and sir walter and elizabeth arose and disappeared .
austen	persuasion	the interruption had been short , though severe , and ease and animation returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out , but not to anne . she could think only of the invitation she had with such astonishment witnessed , and of the manner in which it had been received ; a manner of doubtful meaning , of surprise rather than gratification , of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance . she knew him ; she saw disdain in his eye , and could not venture to believe that he had determined to accept such an offering , as an atonement for all the insolence of the past . her spirits sank . he held the card in his hand after they were gone , as if deeply considering it .
austen	persuasion	“ only think of elizabeth ’ s including everybody ! ” whispered mary very audibly . “ i do not wonder captain wentworth is delighted ! you see he can not put the card out of his hand. ” anne caught his eye , saw his cheeks glow , and his mouth form itself into a momentary expression of contempt , and turned away , that she might neither see nor hear more to vex her .
austen	persuasion	the party separated . the gentlemen had their own pursuits , the ladies proceeded on their own business , and they met no more while anne belonged to them . she was earnestly begged to return and dine , and give them all the rest of the day , but her spirits had been so long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more , and fit only for home , where she might be sure of being as silent as she chose .
austen	persuasion	promising to be with them the whole of the following morning , therefore , she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to camden place , there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements of elizabeth and mrs clay for the morrow ’ s party , the frequent enumeration of the persons invited , and the continually improving detail of all the embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant of its kind in bath , while harassing herself with the never-ending question , of whether captain wentworth would come or not ? they were reckoning him as certain , but with her it was a gnawing solicitude never appeased for five minutes together . she generally thought he would come , because she generally thought he ought ; but it was a case which she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion , as inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings .
austen	persuasion	she only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation , to let mrs clay know that she had been seen with mr elliot three hours after his being supposed to be out of bath , for having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview from the lady herself , she determined to mention it , and it seemed to her there was guilt in mrs clay ’ s face as she listened . it was transient : cleared away in an instant ; but anne could imagine she read there the consciousness of having , by some complication of mutual trick , or some overbearing authority of his , been obliged to attend ( perhaps for half an hour ) to his lectures and restrictions on her designs on sir walter . she exclaimed , however , with a very tolerable imitation of nature : —
austen	persuasion	“ oh ! dear ! very true . only think , miss elliot , to my great surprise i met with mr elliot in bath street . i was never more astonished . he turned back and walked with me to the pump yard . he had been prevented setting off for thornberry , but i really forget by what ; for i was in a hurry , and could not much attend , and i can only answer for his being determined not to be delayed in his return . he wanted to know how early he might be admitted to-morrow . he was full of ‘ to-morrow , ’ and it is very evident that i have been full of it too , ever since i entered the house , and learnt the extension of your plan and all that had happened , or my seeing him could never have gone so entirely out of my head . ”
austen	persuasion	chapter xxiii . one day only had passed since anne ’ s conversation with mrs smith ; but a keener interest had succeeded , and she was now so little touched by mr elliot ’ s conduct , except by its effects in one quarter , that it became a matter of course the next morning , still to defer her explanatory visit in rivers street . she had promised to be with the musgroves from breakfast to dinner . her faith was plighted , and mr elliot ’ s character , like the sultaness scheherazade ’ s head , must live another day .
austen	persuasion	she could not keep her appointment punctually , however ; the weather was unfavourable , and she had grieved over the rain on her friends ’ account , and felt it very much on her own , before she was able to attempt the walk . when she reached the white hart , and made her way to the proper apartment , she found herself neither arriving quite in time , nor the first to arrive . the party before her were , mrs musgrove , talking to mrs croft , and captain harville to captain wentworth ; and she immediately heard that mary and henrietta , too impatient to wait , had gone out the moment it had cleared , but would be back again soon , and that the strictest injunctions had been left with mrs musgrove to keep her there till they returned . she had only to submit , sit down , be outwardly composed , and feel herself plunged at once in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of tasting a little before the morning closed . there was no delay , no waste of time . she was deep in the happiness of such misery , or the misery of such happiness , instantly . two minutes after her entering the room , captain wentworth said—
austen	persuasion	“ we will write the letter we were talking of , harville , now , if you will give me materials. ” materials were at hand , on a separate table ; he went to it , and nearly turning his back to them all , was engrossed by writing .
austen	persuasion	mrs musgrove was giving mrs croft the history of her eldest daughter ’ s engagement , and just in that inconvenient tone of voice which was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper . anne felt that she did not belong to the conversation , and yet , as captain harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk , she could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars ; such as , “ how mr musgrove and my brother hayter had met again and again to talk it over ; what my brother hayter had said one day , and what mr musgrove had proposed the next , and what had occurred to my sister hayter , and what the young people had wished , and what i said at first i never could consent to , but was afterwards persuaded to think might do very well , ” and a great deal in the same style of open-hearted communication : minutiae which , even with every advantage of taste and delicacy , which good mrs musgrove could not give , could be properly interesting only to the principals . mrs croft was attending with great good-humour , and whenever she spoke at all , it was very sensibly . anne hoped the gentlemen might each be too much self-occupied to hear .
austen	persuasion	“ and so , ma ’ am , all these thing considered , ” said mrs musgrove , in her powerful whisper , “ though we could have wished it different , yet , altogether , we did not think it fair to stand out any longer , for charles hayter was quite wild about it , and henrietta was pretty near as bad ; and so we thought they had better marry at once , and make the best of it , as many others have done before them . at any rate , said i , it will be better than a long engagement . ”
austen	persuasion	“ that is precisely what i was going to observe , ” cried mrs croft . “ i would rather have young people settle on a small income at once , and have to struggle with a few difficulties together , than be involved in a long engagement . i always think that no mutual— ”
austen	persuasion	“ oh ! dear mrs croft , ” cried mrs musgrove , unable to let her finish her speech , “ there is nothing i so abominate for young people as a long engagement . it is what i always protested against for my children . it is all very well , i used to say , for young people to be engaged , if there is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months , or even in twelve ; but a long engagement— ”
austen	persuasion	“ yes , dear ma ’ am , ” said mrs croft , “ or an uncertain engagement , an engagement which may be long . to begin without knowing that at such a time there will be the means of marrying , i hold to be very unsafe and unwise , and what i think all parents should prevent as far as they can . ”
austen	persuasion	anne found an unexpected interest here . she felt its application to herself , felt it in a nervous thrill all over her ; and at the same moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table , captain wentworth ’ s pen ceased to move , his head was raised , pausing , listening , and he turned round the next instant to give a look , one quick , conscious look at her .
austen	persuasion	the two ladies continued to talk , to re-urge the same admitted truths , and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation , but anne heard nothing distinctly ; it was only a buzz of words in her ear , her mind was in confusion .
austen	persuasion	captain harville , who had in truth been hearing none of it , now left his seat , and moved to a window , and anne seeming to watch him , though it was from thorough absence of mind , became gradually sensible that he was inviting her to join him where he stood . he looked at her with a smile , and a little motion of the head , which expressed , “ come to me , i have something to say ; ” and the unaffected , easy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance than he really was , strongly enforced the invitation . she roused herself and went to him . the window at which he stood was at the other end of the room from where the two ladies were sitting , and though nearer to captain wentworth ’ s table , not very near . as she joined him , captain harville ’ s countenance re-assumed the serious , thoughtful expression which seemed its natural character .
austen	persuasion	“ look here , ” said he , unfolding a parcel in his hand , and displaying a small miniature painting , “ do you know who that is ? ” “ certainly : captain benwick. ” “ yes , and you may guess who it is for . but , ” ( in a deep tone , ) “ it was not done for her . miss elliot , do you remember our walking together at lyme , and grieving for him ? i little thought then—but no matter . this was drawn at the cape . he met with a clever young german artist at the cape , and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister , sat to him , and was bringing it home for her ; and i have now the charge of getting it properly set for another ! it was a commission to me ! but who else was there to employ ? i hope i can allow for him . i am not sorry , indeed , to make it over to another . he undertakes it ; ” ( looking towards captain wentworth , ) “ he is writing about it now. ” and with a quivering lip he wound up the whole by adding , “ poor fanny ! she would not have forgotten him so soon ! ”
austen	persuasion	“ no , ” replied anne , in a low , feeling voice . “ that i can easily believe. ” “ it was not in her nature . she doted on him. ” “ it would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved . ”
austen	persuasion	captain harville smiled , as much as to say , “ do you claim that for your sex ? ” and she answered the question , smiling also , “ yes . we certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us . it is , perhaps , our fate rather than our merit . we can not help ourselves . we live at home , quiet , confined , and our feelings prey upon us . you are forced on exertion . you have always a profession , pursuits , business of some sort or other , to take you back into the world immediately , and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions . ”
austen	persuasion	“ granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men ( which , however , i do not think i shall grant ) , it does not apply to benwick . he has not been forced upon any exertion . the peace turned him on shore at the very moment , and he has been living with us , in our little family circle , ever since . ”
austen	persuasion	“ true , ” said anne , “ very true ; i did not recollect ; but what shall we say now , captain harville ? if the change be not from outward circumstances , it must be from within ; it must be nature , man ’ s nature , which has done the business for captain benwick . ”
austen	persuasion	“ no , no , it is not man ’ s nature . i will not allow it to be more man ’ s nature than woman ’ s to be inconstant and forget those they do love , or have loved . i believe the reverse . i believe in a true analogy between our bodily frames and our mental ; and that as our bodies are the strongest , so are our feelings ; capable of bearing most rough usage , and riding out the heaviest weather . ”
austen	persuasion	“ your feelings may be the strongest , ” replied anne , “ but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender . man is more robust than woman , but he is not longer lived ; which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments . nay , it would be too hard upon you , if it were otherwise . you have difficulties , and privations , and dangers enough to struggle with . you are always labouring and toiling , exposed to every risk and hardship . your home , country , friends , all quitted . neither time , nor health , nor life , to be called your own . it would be hard , indeed ” ( with a faltering voice ) , “ if woman ’ s feelings were to be added to all this . ”
austen	persuasion	“ we shall never agree upon this question , ” captain harville was beginning to say , when a slight noise called their attention to captain wentworth ’ s hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room . it was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down ; but anne was startled at finding him nearer than she had supposed , and half inclined to suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been occupied by them , striving to catch sounds , which yet she did not think he could have caught .
austen	persuasion	“ have you finished your letter ? ” said captain harville . “ not quite , a few lines more . i shall have done in five minutes. ” “ there is no hurry on my side . i am only ready whenever you are . i am in very good anchorage here , ” ( smiling at anne , ) “ well supplied , and want for nothing . no hurry for a signal at all . well , miss elliot , ” ( lowering his voice , ) “ as i was saying we shall never agree , i suppose , upon this point . no man and woman , would , probably . but let me observe that all histories are against you—all stories , prose and verse . if i had such a memory as benwick , i could bring you fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument , and i do not think i ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon woman ’ s inconstancy . songs and proverbs , all talk of woman ’ s fickleness . but perhaps you will say , these were all written by men . ”
austen	persuasion	“ perhaps i shall . yes , yes , if you please , no reference to examples in books . men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story . education has been theirs in so much higher a degree ; the pen has been in their hands . i will not allow books to prove anything . ”
austen	persuasion	“ but how shall we prove anything ? ” “ we never shall . we never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point . it is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof . we each begin , probably , with a little bias towards our own sex ; and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has occurred within our own circle ; many of which circumstances ( perhaps those very cases which strike us the most ) may be precisely such as can not be brought forward without betraying a confidence , or in some respect saying what should not be said . ”
austen	persuasion	“ ah ! ” cried captain harville , in a tone of strong feeling , “ if i could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes a last look at his wife and children , and watches the boat that he has sent them off in , as long as it is in sight , and then turns away and says , ‘ god knows whether we ever meet again ! ’ and then , if i could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does see them again ; when , coming back after a twelvemonth ’ s absence , perhaps , and obliged to put into another port , he calculates how soon it be possible to get them there , pretending to deceive himself , and saying , ‘ they can not be here till such a day , ’ but all the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner , and seeing them arrive at last , as if heaven had given them wings , by many hours sooner still ! if i could explain to you all this , and all that a man can bear and do , and glories to do , for the sake of these treasures of his existence ! i speak , you know , only of such men as have hearts ! ” pressing his own with emotion .
austen	persuasion	“ oh ! ” cried anne eagerly , “ i hope i do justice to all that is felt by you , and by those who resemble you . god forbid that i should undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow-creatures ! i should deserve utter contempt if i dared to suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman . no , i believe you capable of everything great and good in your married lives . i believe you equal to every important exertion , and to every domestic forbearance , so long as—if i may be allowed the expression—so long as you have an object . i mean while the woman you love lives , and lives for you . all the privilege i claim for my own sex ( it is not a very enviable one ; you need not covet it ) , is that of loving longest , when existence or when hope is gone . ”
austen	persuasion	she could not immediately have uttered another sentence ; her heart was too full , her breath too much oppressed . “ you are a good soul , ” cried captain harville , putting his hand on her arm , quite affectionately . “ there is no quarrelling with you . and when i think of benwick , my tongue is tied . ”
austen	persuasion	their attention was called towards the others . mrs croft was taking leave . “ here , frederick , you and i part company , i believe , ” said she . “ i am going home , and you have an engagement with your friend . to-night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party , ” ( turning to anne . ) “ we had your sister ’ s card yesterday , and i understood frederick had a card too , though i did not see it ; and you are disengaged , frederick , are you not , as well as ourselves ? ”
austen	persuasion	captain wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste , and either could not or would not answer fully . “ yes , ” said he , “ very true ; here we separate , but harville and i shall soon be after you ; that is , harville , if you are ready , i am in half a minute . i know you will not be sorry to be off . i shall be at your service in half a minute . ”
austen	persuasion	mrs croft left them , and captain wentworth , having sealed his letter with great rapidity , was indeed ready , and had even a hurried , agitated air , which shewed impatience to be gone . anne knew not how to understand it . she had the kindest “ good morning , god bless you ! ” from captain harville , but from him not a word , nor a look ! he had passed out of the room without a look !
austen	persuasion	she had only time , however , to move closer to the table where he had been writing , when footsteps were heard returning ; the door opened , it was himself . he begged their pardon , but he had forgotten his gloves , and instantly crossing the room to the writing table , he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper , placed it before anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her for a time , and hastily collecting his gloves , was again out of the room , almost before mrs musgrove was aware of his being in it : the work of an instant !
austen	persuasion	the revolution which one instant had made in anne , was almost beyond expression . the letter , with a direction hardly legible , to “ miss a. e.— , ” was evidently the one which he had been folding so hastily . while supposed to be writing only to captain benwick , he had been also addressing her ! on the contents of that letter depended all which this world could do for her . anything was possible , anything might be defied rather than suspense . mrs musgrove had little arrangements of her own at her own table ; to their protection she must trust , and sinking into the chair which he had occupied , succeeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written , her eyes devoured the following words :
austen	persuasion	“ i can listen no longer in silence . i must speak to you by such means as are within my reach . you pierce my soul . i am half agony , half hope . tell me not that i am too late , that such precious feelings are gone for ever . i offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it , eight years and a half ago . dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman , that his love has an earlier death . i have loved none but you . unjust i may have been , weak and resentful i have been , but never inconstant . you alone have brought me to bath . for you alone , i think and plan . have you not seen this ? can you fail to have understood my wishes ? i had not waited even these ten days , could i have read your feelings , as i think you must have penetrated mine . i can hardly write . i am every instant hearing something which overpowers me . you sink your voice , but i can distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others . too good , too excellent creature ! you do us justice , indeed . you do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men . believe it to be most fervent , most undeviating , in
austen	persuasion	f. w. “ i must go , uncertain of my fate ; but i shall return hither , or follow your party , as soon as possible . a word , a look , will be enough to decide whether i enter your father ’ s house this evening or never . ”
austen	persuasion	such a letter was not to be soon recovered from . half an hour ’ s solitude and reflection might have tranquillized her ; but the ten minutes only which now passed before she was interrupted , with all the restraints of her situation , could do nothing towards tranquillity . every moment rather brought fresh agitation . it was overpowering happiness . and before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation , charles , mary , and henrietta all came in .
austen	persuasion	the absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then an immediate struggle ; but after a while she could do no more . she began not to understand a word they said , and was obliged to plead indisposition and excuse herself . they could then see that she looked very ill , were shocked and concerned , and would not stir without her for the world . this was dreadful . would they only have gone away , and left her in the quiet possession of that room it would have been her cure ; but to have them all standing or waiting around her was distracting , and in desperation , she said she would go home .
austen	persuasion	“ by all means , my dear , ” cried mrs musgrove , “ go home directly , and take care of yourself , that you may be fit for the evening . i wish sarah was here to doctor you , but i am no doctor myself . charles , ring and order a chair . she must not walk . ”
austen	persuasion	but the chair would never do . worse than all ! to lose the possibility of speaking two words to captain wentworth in the course of her quiet , solitary progress up the town ( and she felt almost certain of meeting him ) could not be borne . the chair was earnestly protested against , and mrs musgrove , who thought only of one sort of illness , having assured herself with some anxiety , that there had been no fall in the case ; that anne had not at any time lately slipped down , and got a blow on her head ; that she was perfectly convinced of having had no fall ; could part with her cheerfully , and depend on finding her better at night .
austen	persuasion	anxious to omit no possible precaution , anne struggled , and said— “ i am afraid , ma ’ am , that it is not perfectly understood . pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening . i am afraid there had been some mistake ; and i wish you particularly to assure captain harville and captain wentworth , that we hope to see them both . ”
austen	persuasion	“ oh ! my dear , it is quite understood , i give you my word . captain harville has no thought but of going. ” “ do you think so ? but i am afraid ; and i should be so very sorry . will you promise me to mention it , when you see them again ? you will see them both this morning , i dare say . do promise me . ”
austen	persuasion	“ to be sure i will , if you wish it . charles , if you see captain harville anywhere , remember to give miss anne ’ s message . but indeed , my dear , you need not be uneasy . captain harville holds himself quite engaged , i ’ ll answer for it ; and captain wentworth the same , i dare say . ”
austen	persuasion	anne could do no more ; but her heart prophesied some mischance to damp the perfection of her felicity . it could not be very lasting , however . even if he did not come to camden place himself , it would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence by captain harville . another momentary vexation occurred . charles , in his real concern and good nature , would go home with her ; there was no preventing him . this was almost cruel . but she could not be long ungrateful ; he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith ’ s , to be of use to her ; and she set off with him , with no feeling but gratitude apparent .
austen	persuasion	they were on union street , when a quicker step behind , a something of familiar sound , gave her two moments ’ preparation for the sight of captain wentworth . he joined them ; but , as if irresolute whether to join or to pass on , said nothing , only looked . anne could command herself enough to receive that look , and not repulsively . the cheeks which had been pale now glowed , and the movements which had hesitated were decided . he walked by her side . presently , struck by a sudden thought , charles said—
austen	persuasion	“ captain wentworth , which way are you going ? only to gay street , or farther up the town ? ” “ i hardly know , ” replied captain wentworth , surprised . “ are you going as high as belmont ? are you going near camden place ? because , if you are , i shall have no scruple in asking you to take my place , and give anne your arm to her father ’ s door . she is rather done for this morning , and must not go so far without help , and i ought to be at that fellow ’ s in the market place . he promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off ; said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment , that i might see it ; and if i do not turn back now , i have no chance . by his description , a good deal like the second size double-barrel of mine , which you shot with one day round winthrop . ”
austen	persuasion	there could not be an objection . there could be only the most proper alacrity , a most obliging compliance for public view ; and smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture . in half a minute charles was at the bottom of union street again , and the other two proceeding together : and soon words enough had passed between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel walk , where the power of conversation would make the present hour a blessing indeed , and prepare it for all the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow . there they exchanged again those feelings and those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything , but which had been followed by so many , many years of division and estrangement . there they returned again into the past , more exquisitely happy , perhaps , in their re-union , than when it had been first projected ; more tender , more tried , more fixed in a knowledge of each other ’ s character , truth , and attachment ; more equal to act , more justified in acting . and there , as they slowly paced the gradual ascent , heedless of every group around them , seeing neither sauntering politicians , bustling housekeepers , flirting girls , nor nursery-maids and children , they could indulge in those retrospections and acknowledgements , and especially in those explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment , which were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest . all the little variations of the last week were gone through ; and of yesterday and today there could scarcely be an end .
austen	persuasion	she had not mistaken him . jealousy of mr elliot had been the retarding weight , the doubt , the torment . that had begun to operate in the very hour of first meeting her in bath ; that had returned , after a short suspension , to ruin the concert ; and that had influenced him in everything he had said and done , or omitted to say and do , in the last four-and-twenty hours . it had been gradually yielding to the better hopes which her looks , or words , or actions occasionally encouraged ; it had been vanquished at last by those sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked with captain harville ; and under the irresistible governance of which he had seized a sheet of paper , and poured out his feelings .
austen	persuasion	of what he had then written , nothing was to be retracted or qualified . he persisted in having loved none but her . she had never been supplanted . he never even believed himself to see her equal . thus much indeed he was obliged to acknowledge : that he had been constant unconsciously , nay unintentionally ; that he had meant to forget her , and believed it to be done . he had imagined himself indifferent , when he had only been angry ; and he had been unjust to her merits , because he had been a sufferer from them . her character was now fixed on his mind as perfection itself , maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude and gentleness ; but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at uppercross had he learnt to do her justice , and only at lyme had he begun to understand himself . at lyme , he had received lessons of more than one sort . the passing admiration of mr elliot had at least roused him , and the scenes on the cobb and at captain harville ’ s had fixed her superiority .
austen	persuasion	in his preceding attempts to attach himself to louisa musgrove ( the attempts of angry pride ) , he protested that he had for ever felt it to be impossible ; that he had not cared , could not care , for louisa ; though till that day , till the leisure for reflection which followed it , he had not understood the perfect excellence of the mind with which louisa ’ s could so ill bear a comparison , or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own . there , he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle and the obstinacy of self-will , between the darings of heedlessness and the resolution of a collected mind . there he had seen everything to exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost ; and there begun to deplore the pride , the folly , the madness of resentment , which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way .
austen	persuasion	from that period his penance had become severe . he had no sooner been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days of louisa ’ s accident , no sooner begun to feel himself alive again , than he had begun to feel himself , though alive , not at liberty .
austen	persuasion	“ i found , ” said he , “ that i was considered by harville an engaged man ! that neither harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment . i was startled and shocked . to a degree , i could contradict this instantly ; but , when i began to reflect that others might have felt the same—her own family , nay , perhaps herself—i was no longer at my own disposal . i was hers in honour if she wished it . i had been unguarded . i had not thought seriously on this subject before . i had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways ; and that i had no right to be trying whether i could attach myself to either of the girls , at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report , were there no other ill effects . i had been grossly wrong , and must abide the consequences . ”
austen	persuasion	he found too late , in short , that he had entangled himself ; and that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring for louisa at all , he must regard himself as bound to her , if her sentiments for him were what the harvilles supposed . it determined him to leave lyme , and await her complete recovery elsewhere . he would gladly weaken , by any fair means , whatever feelings or speculations concerning him might exist ; and he went , therefore , to his brother ’ s , meaning after a while to return to kellynch , and act as circumstances might require .
austen	persuasion	“ i was six weeks with edward , ” said he , “ and saw him happy . i could have no other pleasure . i deserved none . he enquired after you very particularly ; asked even if you were personally altered , little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter . ”
austen	persuasion	anne smiled , and let it pass . it was too pleasing a blunder for a reproach . it is something for a woman to be assured , in her eight-and-twentieth year , that she has not lost one charm of earlier youth ; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased to anne , by comparing it with former words , and feeling it to be the result , not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment .
austen	persuasion	he had remained in shropshire , lamenting the blindness of his own pride , and the blunders of his own calculations , till at once released from louisa by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement with benwick .
austen	persuasion	“ here , ” said he , “ ended the worst of my state ; for now i could at least put myself in the way of happiness ; i could exert myself ; i could do something . but to be waiting so long in inaction , and waiting only for evil , had been dreadful . within the first five minutes i said , ‘ i will be at bath on wednesday , ’ and i was . was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come ? and to arrive with some degree of hope ? you were single . it was possible that you might retain the feelings of the past , as i did ; and one encouragement happened to be mine . i could never doubt that you would be loved and sought by others , but i knew to a certainty that you had refused one man , at least , of better pretensions than myself ; and i could not help often saying , ‘ was this for me ? ’ ”
austen	persuasion	their first meeting in milsom street afforded much to be said , but the concert still more . that evening seemed to be made up of exquisite moments . the moment of her stepping forward in the octagon room to speak to him : the moment of mr elliot ’ s appearing and tearing her away , and one or two subsequent moments , marked by returning hope or increasing despondency , were dwelt on with energy .
austen	persuasion	“ to see you , ” cried he , “ in the midst of those who could not be my well-wishers ; to see your cousin close by you , conversing and smiling , and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match ! to consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to influence you ! even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent , to consider what powerful supports would be his ! was it not enough to make the fool of me which i appeared ? how could i look on without agony ? was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you , was not the recollection of what had been , the knowledge of her influence , the indelible , immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done—was it not all against me ? ”
austen	persuasion	“ you should have distinguished , ” replied anne . “ you should not have suspected me now ; the case is so different , and my age is so different . if i was wrong in yielding to persuasion once , remember that it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety , not of risk . when i yielded , i thought it was to duty , but no duty could be called in aid here . in marrying a man indifferent to me , all risk would have been incurred , and all duty violated . ”
austen	persuasion	“ perhaps i ought to have reasoned thus , ” he replied , “ but i could not . i could not derive benefit from the late knowledge i had acquired of your character . i could not bring it into play ; it was overwhelmed , buried , lost in those earlier feelings which i had been smarting under year after year . i could think of you only as one who had yielded , who had given me up , who had been influenced by any one rather than by me . i saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery . i had no reason to believe her of less authority now . the force of habit was to be added . ”
austen	persuasion	“ i should have thought , ” said anne , “ that my manner to yourself might have spared you much or all of this. ” “ no , no ! your manner might be only the ease which your engagement to another man would give . i left you in this belief ; and yet , i was determined to see you again . my spirits rallied with the morning , and i felt that i had still a motive for remaining here . ”
austen	persuasion	at last anne was at home again , and happier than any one in that house could have conceived . all the surprise and suspense , and every other painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation , she re-entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy in some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last . an interval of meditation , serious and grateful , was the best corrective of everything dangerous in such high-wrought felicity ; and she went to her room , and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness of her enjoyment .
austen	persuasion	the evening came , the drawing-rooms were lighted up , the company assembled . it was but a card party , it was but a mixture of those who had never met before , and those who met too often ; a commonplace business , too numerous for intimacy , too small for variety ; but anne had never found an evening shorter . glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness , and more generally admired than she thought about or cared for , she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her . mr elliot was there ; she avoided , but she could pity him . the wallises , she had amusement in understanding them . lady dalrymple and miss carteret—they would soon be innoxious cousins to her . she cared not for mrs clay , and had nothing to blush for in the public manners of her father and sister . with the musgroves , there was the happy chat of perfect ease ; with captain harville , the kind-hearted intercourse of brother and sister ; with lady russell , attempts at conversation , which a delicious consciousness cut short ; with admiral and mrs croft , everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest , which the same consciousness sought to conceal ; and with captain wentworth , some moments of communications continually occurring , and always the hope of more , and always the knowledge of his being there .
austen	persuasion	it was in one of these short meetings , each apparently occupied in admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants , that she said— “ i have been thinking over the past , and trying impartially to judge of the right and wrong , i mean with regard to myself ; and i must believe that i was right , much as i suffered from it , that i was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you do now . to me , she was in the place of a parent . do not mistake me , however . i am not saying that she did not err in her advice . it was , perhaps , one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides ; and for myself , i certainly never should , in any circumstance of tolerable similarity , give such advice . but i mean , that i was right in submitting to her , and that if i had done otherwise , i should have suffered more in continuing the engagement than i did even in giving it up , because i should have suffered in my conscience . i have now , as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature , nothing to reproach myself with ; and if i mistake not , a strong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman ’ s portion . ”
austen	persuasion	he looked at her , looked at lady russell , and looking again at her , replied , as if in cool deliberation— “ not yet . but there are hopes of her being forgiven in time . i trust to being in charity with her soon . but i too have been thinking over the past , and a question has suggested itself , whether there may not have been one person more my enemy even than that lady ? my own self . tell me if , when i returned to england in the year eight , with a few thousand pounds , and was posted into the laconia , if i had then written to you , would you have answered my letter ? would you , in short , have renewed the engagement then ? ”
austen	persuasion	“ would i ! ” was all her answer ; but the accent was decisive enough . “ good god ! ” he cried , “ you would ! it is not that i did not think of it , or desire it , as what could alone crown all my other success ; but i was proud , too proud to ask again . i did not understand you . i shut my eyes , and would not understand you , or do you justice . this is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one sooner than myself . six years of separation and suffering might have been spared . it is a sort of pain , too , which is new to me . i have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn every blessing that i enjoyed . i have valued myself on honourable toils and just rewards . like other great men under reverses , ” he added , with a smile . “ i must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune . i must learn to brook being happier than i deserve . ”
austen	persuasion	chapter xxiv . who can be in doubt of what followed ? when any two young people take it into their heads to marry , they are pretty sure by perseverance to carry their point , be they ever so poor , or ever so imprudent , or ever so little likely to be necessary to each other ’ s ultimate comfort . this may be bad morality to conclude with , but i believe it to be truth ; and if such parties succeed , how should a captain wentworth and an anne elliot , with the advantage of maturity of mind , consciousness of right , and one independent fortune between them , fail of bearing down every opposition ? they might in fact , have borne down a great deal more than they met with , for there was little to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth . sir walter made no objection , and elizabeth did nothing worse than look cold and unconcerned . captain wentworth , with five-and-twenty thousand pounds , and as high in his profession as merit and activity could place him , was no longer nobody . he was now esteemed quite worthy to address the daughter of a foolish , spendthrift baronet , who had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself in the situation in which providence had placed him , and who could give his daughter at present but a small part of the share of ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter .
austen	persuasion	sir walter , indeed , though he had no affection for anne , and no vanity flattered , to make him really happy on the occasion , was very far from thinking it a bad match for her . on the contrary , when he saw more of captain wentworth , saw him repeatedly by daylight , and eyed him well , he was very much struck by his personal claims , and felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced against her superiority of rank ; and all this , assisted by his well-sounding name , enabled sir walter at last to prepare his pen , with a very good grace , for the insertion of the marriage in the volume of honour .
austen	persuasion	the only one among them , whose opposition of feeling could excite any serious anxiety was lady russell . anne knew that lady russell must be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing mr elliot , and be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with , and do justice to captain wentworth . this however was what lady russell had now to do . she must learn to feel that she had been mistaken with regard to both ; that she had been unfairly influenced by appearances in each ; that because captain wentworth ’ s manners had not suited her own ideas , she had been too quick in suspecting them to indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity ; and that because mr elliot ’ s manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety and correctness , their general politeness and suavity , she had been too quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct opinions and well-regulated mind . there was nothing less for lady russell to do , than to admit that she had been pretty completely wrong , and to take up a new set of opinions and of hopes .
austen	persuasion	there is a quickness of perception in some , a nicety in the discernment of character , a natural penetration , in short , which no experience in others can equal , and lady russell had been less gifted in this part of understanding than her young friend . but she was a very good woman , and if her second object was to be sensible and well-judging , her first was to see anne happy . she loved anne better than she loved her own abilities ; and when the awkwardness of the beginning was over , found little hardship in attaching herself as a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child .
austen	persuasion	of all the family , mary was probably the one most immediately gratified by the circumstance . it was creditable to have a sister married , and she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental to the connexion , by keeping anne with her in the autumn ; and as her own sister must be better than her husband ’ s sisters , it was very agreeable that captain wentworth should be a richer man than either captain benwick or charles hayter . she had something to suffer , perhaps , when they came into contact again , in seeing anne restored to the rights of seniority , and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette ; but she had a future to look forward to , of powerful consolation . anne had no uppercross hall before her , no landed estate , no headship of a family ; and if they could but keep captain wentworth from being made a baronet , she would not change situations with anne .
austen	persuasion	it would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied with her situation , for a change is not very probable there . she had soon the mortification of seeing mr elliot withdraw , and no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise even the unfounded hopes which sunk with him .
austen	persuasion	the news of his cousin anne ’ s engagement burst on mr elliot most unexpectedly . it deranged his best plan of domestic happiness , his best hope of keeping sir walter single by the watchfulness which a son-in-law ’ s rights would have given . but , though discomfited and disappointed , he could still do something for his own interest and his own enjoyment . he soon quitted bath ; and on mrs clay ’ s quitting it soon afterwards , and being next heard of as established under his protection in london , it was evident how double a game he had been playing , and how determined he was to save himself from being cut out by one artful woman , at least .
austen	persuasion	mrs clay ’ s affections had overpowered her interest , and she had sacrificed , for the young man ’ s sake , the possibility of scheming longer for sir walter . she has abilities , however , as well as affections ; and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning , or hers , may finally carry the day ; whether , after preventing her from being the wife of sir walter , he may not be wheedled and caressed at last into making her the wife of sir william .
austen	persuasion	it can not be doubted that sir walter and elizabeth were shocked and mortified by the loss of their companion , and the discovery of their deception in her . they had their great cousins , to be sure , to resort to for comfort ; but they must long feel that to flatter and follow others , without being flattered and followed in turn , is but a state of half enjoyment .
austen	persuasion	anne , satisfied at a very early period of lady russell ’ s meaning to love captain wentworth as she ought , had no other alloy to the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness of having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value . there she felt her own inferiority very keenly . the disproportion in their fortune was nothing ; it did not give her a moment ’ s regret ; but to have no family to receive and estimate him properly , nothing of respectability , of harmony , of good will to offer in return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her in his brothers and sisters , was a source of as lively pain as her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise strong felicity . she had but two friends in the world to add to his list , lady russell and mrs smith . to those , however , he was very well disposed to attach himself . lady russell , in spite of all her former transgressions , he could now value from his heart . while he was not obliged to say that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them , he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour , and as for mrs smith , she had claims of various kinds to recommend her quickly and permanently .
austen	persuasion	her recent good offices by anne had been enough in themselves , and their marriage , instead of depriving her of one friend , secured her two . she was their earliest visitor in their settled life ; and captain wentworth , by putting her in the way of recovering her husband ’ s property in the west indies , by writing for her , acting for her , and seeing her through all the petty difficulties of the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man and a determined friend , fully requited the services which she had rendered , or ever meant to render , to his wife .
austen	persuasion	mrs smith ’ s enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income , with some improvement of health , and the acquisition of such friends to be often with , for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not fail her ; and while these prime supplies of good remained , she might have bid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity . she might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy , and yet be happy . her spring of felicity was in the glow of her spirits , as her friend anne ’ s was in the warmth of her heart . anne was tenderness itself , and she had the full worth of it in captain wentworth ’ s affection . his profession was all that could ever make her friends wish that tenderness less , the dread of a future war all that could dim her sunshine . she gloried in being a sailor ’ s wife , but she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession which is , if possible , more distinguished in its domestic virtues than in its national importance .

christie	links	1 a fellow traveller i believe that a well-known anecdote exists to the effect that a young writer , determined to make the commencement of his story forcible and original enough to catch and rivet the attention of the most blasé of editors , penned the following sentence :
christie	links	“ ‘ hell ! ’ said the duchess. ” strangely enough , this tale of mine opens in much the same fashion . only the lady who gave utterance to the exclamation was not a duchess ! it was a day in early june . i had been transacting some business in paris and was returning by the morning service to london where i was still sharing rooms with my old friend , the belgian ex-detective , hercule poirot .
christie	links	the calais express was singularly empty—in fact , my own compartment held only one other traveller . i had made a somewhat hurried departure from the hotel and was busy assuring myself that i had duly collected all my traps when the train started . up till then i had hardly noticed my companion , but i was now violently recalled to the fact of her existence . jumping up from her seat , she let down the window and stuck her head out , withdrawing it a moment later with the brief and forcible ejaculation “ hell ! ”
christie	links	now i am old-fashioned . a woman , i consider , should be womanly . i have no patience with the modern neurotic girl who jazzes from morning to night , smokes like a chimney , and uses language which would make a billingsgate fishwoman blush !
christie	links	i looked up now , frowning slightly , into a pretty , impudent face , surmounted by a rakish little red hat . a thick cluster of black curls hid each ear . i judged that she was little more than seventeen , but her face was covered with powder , and her lips were quite impossibly scarlet .
christie	links	nothing abashed , she returned my glance , and executed an expressive grimace . “ dear me , we ’ ve shocked the kind gentleman ! ” she observed to an imaginary audience . “ i apologize for my language ! most unladylike , and all that , but oh , lord , there ’ s reason enough for it ! do you know i ’ ve lost my only sister ? ”
christie	links	“ really ? ” i said politely . “ how unfortunate. ” “ he disapproves ! ” remarked the lady . “ he disapproves utterly—of me , and my sister—which last is unfair , because he hasn ’ t seen her ! ” i opened my mouth , but she forestalled me .
christie	links	“ say no more ! nobody loves me ! i shall go into the garden and eat worms ! boohoo ! i am crushed ! ” she buried herself behind a large comic french paper . in a minute or two i saw her eyes stealthily peeping at me over the top . in spite of myself i could not help smiling , and in a minute she had tossed the paper aside , and had burst into a merry peal of laughter .
christie	links	“ i knew you weren ’ t such a mutt as you looked , ” she cried . her laughter was so infectious that i could not help joining in , though i hardly cared for the word “ mutt. ” the girl was certainly all that i most disliked , but that was no reason why i should make myself ridiculous by my attitude . i prepared to unbend . after all , she was decidedly pretty.…
christie	links	“ there ! now we ’ re friends ! ” declared the minx . “ say you ’ re sorry about my sister— ” “ i am desolated ! ” “ that ’ s a good boy ! ” “ let me finish . i was going to add that , although i am desolated , i can manage to put up with her absence very well. ” i made a little bow .
christie	links	but this most unaccountable of damsels frowned and shook her head . “ cut it out . i prefer the ‘ dignified disapproval ’ stunt . oh , your face ! ‘ not one of us , ’ it said . and you were right there—though , mind you , it ’ s pretty hard to tell nowadays . it ’ s not every one who can distinguish between a demi and a duchess . there now , i believe i ’ ve shocked you again ! you ’ ve been dug out of the backwoods , you have . not that i mind that . we could do with a few more of your sort . i just hate a fellow who gets fresh . it makes me mad . ”
christie	links	she shook her head vigorously . “ what are you like when you ’ re mad ? ” i inquired with a smile . “ a regular little devil ! don ’ t care what i say , or what i do , either ! i nearly did a chap in once . yes , really . he ’ d have deserved it too . italian blood i ’ ve got . i shall get into trouble one of these days . ”
christie	links	“ well , ” i begged , “ don ’ t get mad with me. ” “ i shan ’ t . i like you—did the first moment i set eyes on you . but you looked so disapproving that i never thought we should make friends . ”
christie	links	“ well , we have . tell me something about yourself. ” “ i ’ m an actress . no—not the kind you ’ re thinking of , lunching at the savoy covered with jewellery , and with their photograph in every paper saying how much they love madame so and so ’ s face cream . i ’ ve been on the boards since i was a kid of six—tumbling . ”
christie	links	“ i beg your pardon , ” i said puzzled . “ haven ’ t you seen child acrobats ? ” “ oh , i understand. ” “ i ’ m american born , but i ’ ve spent most of my life in england . we got a new show now— ”
christie	links	“ we ? ” “ my sister and i . sort of song and dance , and a bit of patter , and a dash of the old business thrown in . it ’ s quite a new idea , and it hits them every time . there ’ s to be money in it— ”
christie	links	my new acquaintance leaned forward , and discoursed volubly , a great many of her terms being quite unintelligible to me . yet i found myself evincing an increasing interest in her . she seemed such a curious mixture of child and woman . though perfectly worldly-wise , and able , as she expressed it , to take care of herself , there was yet something curiously ingenuous in her single-minded attitude towards life , and her whole-hearted determination to “ make good. ” this glimpse of a world unknown to me was not without its charm , and i enjoyed seeing her vivid little face light up as she talked .
christie	links	we passed through amiens . the name awakened many memories . my companion seemed to have an intuitive knowledge of what was in my mind . “ thinking of the war ? ” i nodded . “ you were through it , i suppose ? ”
christie	links	“ pretty well . i was wounded once , and after the somme they invalided me out altogether . i had a half fledged army job for a bit . i ’ m a sort of private secretary now to an m. p . ”
christie	links	“ my ! that ’ s brainy ! ” “ no , it isn ’ t . there ’ s really awfully little to do . usually a couple of hours every day sees me through . it ’ s dull work too . in fact , i don ’ t know what i should do if i hadn ’ t got something to fall back upon . ”
christie	links	“ don ’ t say you collect bugs ! ” “ no . i share rooms with a very interesting man . he ’ s a belgian—an ex-detective . he ’ s set up as a private detective in london , and he ’ s doing extraordinarily well . he ’ s really a very marvellous little man . time and again he has proved to be right where the official police have failed . ”
christie	links	my companion listened with widening eyes . “ isn ’ t that interesting , now ? i just adore crime . i go to all the mysteries on the movies . and when there ’ s a murder on i just devour the papers . ”
christie	links	“ do you remember the styles case ? ” i asked . “ let me see , was that the old lady who was poisoned ? somewhere down in essex ? ” i nodded . “ that was poirot ’ s first big case . undoubtedly , but for him , the murderer would have escaped scot-free . it was a most wonderful bit of detective work . ”
christie	links	warming to my subject , i ran over the heads of the affair , working up to the triumphant and unexpected dénouement . the girl listened spellbound . in fact , we were so absorbed that the train drew into calais station before we realized it .
christie	links	“ my goodness gracious me ! ” cried my companion . “ where ’ s my powder-puff ? ” she proceeded to bedaub her face liberally , and then applied a stick of lip salve to her lips , observing the effect in a small pocket glass , and betraying not the faintest sign of self-consciousness .
christie	links	“ i say , ” i hesitated . “ i dare say it ’ s cheek on my part , but why do all that sort of thing ? ” the girl paused in her operations , and stared at me with undisguised surprise .
christie	links	“ it isn ’ t as though you weren ’ t so pretty that you can afford to do without it , ” i said stammeringly . “ my dear boy ! i ’ ve got to do it . all the girls do . think i want to look like a little frump up from the country ? ” she took one last look in the mirror , smiled approval , and put it and her vanity-box away in her bag . “ that ’ s better . keeping up appearances is a bit of a fag , i grant , but if a girl respects herself it ’ s up to her not to let herself get slack . ”
christie	links	to this essentially moral sentiment , i had no reply . a point of view makes a great difference . i secured a couple of porters , and we alighted on the platform . my companion held out her hand .
christie	links	“ good-bye , and i ’ ll mind my language better in future. ” “ oh , but surely you ’ ll let me look after you on the boat ? ” “ mayn ’ t be on the boat . i ’ ve got to see whether that sister of mine got aboard after all anywhere . but thanks all the same . ”
christie	links	“ oh , but we ’ re going to meet again , surely ? i— ” i hesitated . “ i want to meet your sister. ” we both laughed . “ that ’ s real nice of you . i ’ ll tell her what you say . but i don ’ t fancy we ’ ll meet again . you ’ ve been very good to me on the journey , especially after i cheeked you as i did . but what your face expressed first thing is quite true . i ’ m not your kind . and that brings trouble—_i___ know that well enough.… ”
christie	links	her face changed . for the moment all the light-hearted gaiety died out of it . it looked angry—revengeful.… “ so good-bye , ” she finished , in a lighter tone . “ aren ’ t you even going to tell me your name ? ” i cried , as she turned away .
christie	links	she looked over her shoulder . a dimple appeared in each cheek . she was like a lovely picture by greuze . “ cinderella , ” she said , and laughed . but little did i think when and how i should see cinderella again .
christie	links	2 an appeal for help it was five minutes past nine when i entered our joint sitting-room for breakfast on the following morning . my friend poirot , exact to the minute as usual , was just tapping the shell of his second egg .
christie	links	he beamed upon me as i entered . “ you have slept well , yes ? you have recovered from the crossing so terrible ? it is a marvel , almost you are exact this morning . _pardon___ , but your tie is not symmetrical . permit that i rearrange him . ”
christie	links	elsewhere , i have described hercule poirot . an extraordinary little man ! height , five feet four inches , egg-shaped head carried a little to one side , eyes that shone green when he was excited , stiff military moustache , air of dignity immense ! he was neat and dandified in appearance . for neatness of any kind , he had an absolute passion . to see an ornament set crooked , or a speck of dust , or a slight disarray in one ’ s attire , was torture to the little man until he could ease his feelings by remedying the matter . “ order ” and “ method ” were his gods . he had a certain disdain for tangible evidence , such as footprints and cigarette ash , and would maintain that , taken by themselves , they would never enable a detective to solve a problem . then he would tap his egg-shaped head with absurd complacency , and remark with great satisfaction : “ the true work , it is done from _within___ . _the little grey cells___—remember always the little grey cells , _mon ami ! ___ ”
christie	links	i slipped into my seat , and remarked idly , in answer to poirot ’ s greeting , that an hour ’ s sea passage from calais to dover could hardly be dignified by the epithet “ terrible . ”
christie	links	poirot waved his egg-spoon in vigorous refutation of my remark . “ _du tout ! ___ if for an hour one experiences sensations and emotions of the most terrible , one has lived many hours ! does not one of your english poets say that time is counted , not by hours , but by heart-beats ? ”
christie	links	“ i fancy browning was referring to something more romantic than sea sickness , though. ” “ because he was an englishman , an islander to whom _la manche___ was nothing . oh , you english ! with _nous autres___ it is different . figure to yourself that a lady of my acquaintance at the beginning of the war fled to ostend . there she had a terrible crisis of the nerves . impossible to escape further except by crossing the sea ! and she had a horror—_mais une horreur ! ___—of the sea ! what was she to do ? daily _les boches___ were drawing nearer . imagine to yourself the terrible situation ! ”
christie	links	“ what did she do ? ” i inquired curiously . “ fortunately her husband was _homme pratique___ . he was also very calm , the crises of the nerves , they affected him not . _il l ’ a emportée simplement ! ___ naturally when she reached england she was prostrate , but she still breathed . ”
christie	links	poirot shook his head seriously . i composed my face as best i could . suddenly he stiffened and pointed a dramatic finger at the toast rack . “ ah , par exemple , c ’ est trop fort ! ” he cried .
christie	links	“ what is it ? ” “ this piece of toast . you remark him not ? ” he whipped the offender out of the rack , and held it up for me to examine . “ is it square ? no . is it a triangle ? again no . is it even round ? no . is it of any shape remotely pleasing to the eye ? what symmetry have we here ? none . ”
christie	links	“ it ’ s cut from a cottage loaf , ” i explained soothingly . poirot threw me a withering glance . “ what an intelligence has my friend hastings ! ” he exclaimed sarcastically . “ comprehend you not that i have forbidden such a loaf—a loaf haphazard and shapeless , that no baker should permit himself to bake ! ”
christie	links	i endeavoured to distract his mind . “ anything interesting come by the post ? ” poirot shook his head with a dissatisfied air . “ i have not yet examined my letters , but nothing of interest arrives nowadays . the great criminals , the criminals of method , they do not exist . the cases i have been employed upon lately were _banal___ to the last degree . in verity i am reduced to recovering lost lap-dogs for fashionable ladies ! the last problem that presented any interest was that intricate little affair of the yardly diamond , and that was—how many months ago , my friend ? ”
christie	links	he shook his head despondently , and i roared with laughter . “ cheer up , poirot , the luck will change . open your letters . for all you know , there may be a great case looming on the horizon . ”
christie	links	poirot smiled , and taking up the neat little letter opener with which he opened his correspondence he slit the tops of the several envelopes that lay by his plate . “ a bill . another bill . it is that i grow extravagant in my old age . aha ! a note from japp . ”
christie	links	“ yes ? ” pricked up my ears . the scotland yard inspector had more than once introduced us to an interesting case . “ he merely thanks me ( in his fashion ) for a little point in the aberystwyth case on which i was able to set him right . i am delighted to have been of service to him . ”
christie	links	“ how does he thank you ? ” i asked curiously , for i knew my japp . “ he is kind enough to say that i am a wonderful sport for my age , and that he was glad to have had the chance of letting me in on the case . ”
christie	links	this was so typical of japp , that i could not forbear a chuckle . poirot continued to read his correspondence placidly . “ a suggestion that i should give a lecture to our local boy scouts . the countess of forfanock will be obliged if i will call and see her . another lap-dog without doubt ! and now for the last . ah— ”
christie	links	i looked up , quick to notice the change of tone . poirot was reading attentively . in a minute he tossed the sheet over to me . “ this is out of the ordinary , _mon ami___ . read for yourself . ”
christie	links	the letter was written on a foreign type of paper , in a bold characteristic hand : “ villa geneviève merlinville-sur-mer france “ _dear sir___ , “ i am in need of the services of a detective and , for reasons which i will give you later , do not wish to call in the official police . i have heard of you from several quarters , and all reports go to show that you are not only a man of decided ability , but one who also knows how to be discreet . i do not wish to trust details to the post , but , on account of a secret i possess , i go in daily fear of my life . i am convinced that the danger is imminent , and therefore i beg that you will lose no time in crossing to france . i will send a car to meet you at calais , if you will wire me when you are arriving . i shall be obliged if you will drop all cases you have on hand , and devote yourself solely to my interests . i am prepared to pay any compensation necessary . i shall probably need your services for a considerable period of time , as it may be necessary for you to go out to santiago , where i spent several years of my life . i shall be content for you to name your own fee . “ assuring you once more that the matter is _urgent___ ,
christie	links	“ yours faithfully “ p . t. renauld. ” below the signature was a hastily scrawled line , almost illegible : “ for god ’ s sake , come ! ” i handed the letter back with quickened pulses . “ at last ! ” i said . “ here is something distinctly out of the ordinary . ”
christie	links	“ yes , indeed , ” said poirot meditatively . “ you will go of course , ” i continued . poirot nodded . he was thinking deeply . finally he seemed to make up his mind , and glanced up at the clock . his face was very grave .
christie	links	“ see you , my friend , there is no time to lose . the continental express leaves victoria at 11 o ’ clock . do not agitate yourself . there is plenty of time . we can allow ten minutes for discussion . you accompany me , _n ’ est-ce pas ? ___ ”
christie	links	“ well— ” “ you told me yourself that your employer needed you not for the next few weeks. ” “ oh , that ’ s all right . but this mr. renauld hints strongly that his business is private . ”
christie	links	“ ta-ta-ta . i will manage m. renauld . by the way , i seem to know the name ? ” “ there ’ s a well-known south american millionaire fellow . his name ’ s renauld . i don ’ t know whether it could be the same . ”
christie	links	“ but without doubt . that explains the mention of santiago . santiago is in chile , and chile it is in south america ! ah , but we progress finely. ” “ dear me , poirot , ” i said , my excitement rising , “ i smell some goodly shekels in this . if we succeed , we shall make our fortunes ! ”
christie	links	“ do not be too sure of that , my friend . a rich man and his money are not so easily parted . me , i have seen a well-known millionaire turn out a tramful of people to seek for a dropped halfpenny . ”
christie	links	i acknowledged the wisdom of this . “ in any case , ” continued poirot , “ it is not the money which attracts me here . certainly it will be pleasant to have _carte blanche___ in our investigations ; one can be sure that way of wasting no time , but it is something a little bizarre in this problem which arouses my interest . you remarked the postscript ? how did it strike you ? ”
christie	links	i considered . “ clearly he wrote the letter keeping himself well in hand , but at the end his self-control snapped and , on the impulse of the moment , he scrawled those four desperate words . ”
christie	links	but my friend shook his head energetically . “ you are in error . see you not that while the ink of the signature is nearly black , that of the postscript is quite pale ? ”
christie	links	“ well ? ” i said puzzled . “ _mon dieu , mon ami___ , but use your little grey cells ! is it not obvious ? m. renauld wrote his letter . without blotting it , he reread it carefully . then , not on impulse , but deliberately , he added those last words , and blotted the sheet . ”
christie	links	“ but why ? ” “ _parbleu ! ___ so that it should produce the effect upon me that it has upon you. ” “ what ? ” “ _mais , oui___—to make sure of my coming ! he reread the letter and was dissatisfied . it was not strong enough ! ”
christie	links	he paused , and then added softly , his eyes shining with that green light that always betokened inward excitement : “ and so , _mon ami___ , since that postscript was added , not on impulse , but soberly , in cold blood , the urgency is very great , and we must reach him as soon as possible . ”
christie	links	“ merlinville , ” i murmured thoughtfully . “ i ’ ve heard of it , i think. ” poirot nodded . “ it is a quiet little place—but chic ! it lies about midway between bolougne and calais . it is rapidly becoming the fashion . rich english people who wish to be quiet are taking it up . m. renauld has a house in england , i suppose ? ”
christie	links	“ yes , in rutland gate , as far as i remember . also a big place in the country , somewhere in hertfordshire . but i really know very little about him , he doesn ’ t do much in a social way . i believe he has large south american interests in the city , and has spent most of his life out in chile and the argentino . ”
christie	links	“ well , we shall hear all details from the man himself . come , let us pack . a small suit-case each , and then a taxi to victoria. ” “ and the countess ? ” i inquired with a smile .
christie	links	“ ah ! _je m ’ en fiche ! ___ her case was certainly not interesting. ” “ why so sure of that ? ” “ because in that case she would have come , not written . a woman can not wait—always remember that , hastings . ”
christie	links	eleven o ’ clock saw our departure from victoria on our way to dover . before starting poirot had despatched a telegram to mr. renauld giving the time of our arrival at calais . “ i ’ m surprised you haven ’ t invested in a few bottles of some sea sick remedy , poirot , ” i observed maliciously , as i recalled our conversation at breakfast .
christie	links	my friend , who was anxiously scanning the weather , turned a reproachful face upon me . “ is it that you have forgotten the method most excellent of laverguier ? his system , i practise it always . one balances oneself , if you remember , turning the head from left to right , breathing in and out , counting six between each breath . ”
christie	links	“ h ’ m , ” i demurred . “ you ’ ll be rather tired of balancing yourself and counting six by the time you get to santiago , or buenos ayres , or wherever it is you land. ” “ _quelle idée ! ___ you do not figure to yourself that i shall go to santiago ? ”
christie	links	“ mr . renauld suggests it in his letter. ” “ he did not know the methods of hercule poirot . i do not run to and fro , making journeys , and agitating myself . my work is done from within—_here___— ” he tapped his forehead significantly .
christie	links	as usual , this remark roused my argumentative faculty . “ it ’ s all very well , poirot , but i think you are falling into the habit of despising certain things too much . a finger-print has led sometimes to the arrest and conviction of a murderer . ”
christie	links	“ and has , without doubt , hanged more than one innocent man , ” remarked poirot dryly . “ but surely the study of finger-prints and footprints , cigarette ash , different kinds of mud , and other clues that comprise the minute observation of details—all these are of vital importance ? ”
christie	links	“ but certainly . i have never said otherwise . the trained observer , the expert , without doubt he is useful ! but the others , the hercules poirots , they are above the experts ! to them the experts bring the facts , their business is the method of the crime , its logical deduction , the proper sequence and order of the facts ; above all , the true psychology of the case . you have hunted the fox , yes ? ”
christie	links	“ i have hunted a bit , now and again , ” i said , rather bewildered by this abrupt change of subject . “ why ? ” “ _eh bien___ , this hunting of the fox , you need the dogs , no ? ”
christie	links	“ hounds , ” i corrected gently . “ yes , of course. ” “ but yet , ” poirot wagged his finger at me . “ you did not descend from your horse and run along the ground smelling with your nose and uttering loud ow ows ? ”
christie	links	in spite of myself i laughed immoderately . poirot nodded in a satisfied manner . “ so . you leave the work of the d— hounds to the hounds . yet you demand that i , hercule poirot , should make myself ridiculous by lying down ( possibly on damp grass ) to study hypothetical footprints , and should scoop up cigarette ash when i do not know one kind from the other . remember the plymouth express mystery . the good japp departed to make a survey of the railway line . when he returned , i , without having moved from my apartments , was able to tell him exactly what he had found . ”
christie	links	“ so you are of the opinion that japp wasted his time. ” “ not at all , since his evidence confirmed my theory . but _i___ should have wasted my time if _i___ had gone . it is the same with so called ‘ experts. ’ remember the handwriting testimony in the cavendish case . one counsel ’ s questioning brings out testimony as to the resemblances , the defence brings evidence to show dissimilarity . all the language is very technical . and the result ? what we all knew in the first place . the writing was very like that of john cavendish . and the psychological mind is faced with the question ‘ why ? ’ because it was actually his ? or because some one wished us to think it was his ? i answered that question , _mon ami___ , and answered it correctly . ”
christie	links	and poirot , having effectually silenced , if not convinced me , leaned back with a satisfied air . on the boat , i knew better than to disturb my friend ’ s solitude . the weather was gorgeous , and the sea as smooth as the proverbial mill-pond , so i was hardly surprised to hear that laverguier ’ s method had once more justified itself when a smiling poirot joined me on disembarking at calais . a disappointment was in store for us , as no car had been sent to meet us , but poirot put this down to his telegram having been delayed in transit .
christie	links	“ since it is _carte blanche___ , we will hire a car , ” he said cheerfully . and a few minutes later saw us creaking and jolting along , in the most ramshackle of automobiles that ever plied for hire , in the direction of merlinville .
christie	links	my spirits were at their highest . “ what gorgeous air ! ” i exclaimed . “ this promises to be a delightful trip. ” “ for you , yes . for me , i have work to do , remember , at our journey ’ s end . ”
christie	links	“ bah ! ” i said cheerfully . “ you will discover all , ensure this mr. renauld ’ s safety , run the would-be assassins to earth , and all will finish in a blaze of glory. ” “ you are sanguine , my friend . ”
christie	links	“ yes , i feel absolutely assured of success . are you not the one and only hercule poirot ? ” but my little friend did not rise to the bait . he was observing me gravely .
christie	links	“ you are what the scotch people call ‘ fey , ’ hastings . it presages disaster. ” “ nonsense . at any rate , you do not share my feelings. ” “ no , but i am afraid. ” “ afraid of what ? ”
christie	links	“ i do not know . but i have a premonition—a _je ne sais quoi ! ___ ” he spoke so gravely , that i was impressed in spite of myself . “ i have a feeling , ” he said slowly , “ that this is going to be a big affair—a long , troublesome problem that will not be easy to work out . ”
christie	links	i would have questioned him further , but we were just coming into the little town of merlinville , and we slowed up to inquire the way to the villa geneviève . “ straight on , monsieur , through the town . the villa geneviève is about half a mile the other side . you can not miss it . a big villa , overlooking the sea . ”
christie	links	we thanked our informant , and drove on , leaving the town behind . a fork in the road brought us to a second halt . a peasant was trudging towards us , and we waited for him to come up to us in order to ask the way again . there was a tiny villa standing right by the road , but it was too small and dilapidated to be the one we wanted . as we waited , the gate of it swung open and a girl came out .
christie	links	the peasant was passing us now , and the driver leaned forward from his seat and asked for direction . “ the villa geneviève ? just a few steps up this road to the right , monsieur . you could see it if it were not for the curve . ”
christie	links	the chauffeur thanked him , and started the car again . my eyes were fascinated by the girl who still stood , with one hand on the gate , watching us . i am an admirer of beauty , and here was one whom nobody could have passed without remark . very tall , with the proportions of a young goddess , her uncovered golden head gleaming in the sunlight , i swore to myself that she was one of the most beautiful girls i had ever seen . as we swung up the rough road , i turned my head to look after her .
christie	links	“ by jove , poirot , ” i exclaimed , “ did you see that young goddess. ” poirot raised his eyebrows . “ _ça commence ! ___ ” he murmured . “ already you have seen a goddess ! ” “ but , hang it all , wasn ’ t she ? ”
christie	links	“ possibly . i did not remark the fact. ” “ surely you noticed her ? ” “ _mon ami___ , two people rarely see the same thing . you , for instance , saw a goddess . i— ” he hesitated . “ yes ? ”
christie	links	“ i saw only a girl with anxious eyes , ” said poirot gravely . but at that moment we drew up at a big green gate , and , simultaneously , we both uttered an exclamation . before it stood an imposing _sergent de ville___ . he held up his hand to bar our way .
christie	links	“ you can not pass , monsieurs. ” “ but we wish to see mr. renauld , ” i cried . “ we have an appointment . this is his villa , isn ’ t it ? ” “ yes , monsieur , but— ” poirot leaned forward . “ but what ? ”
christie	links	“ m . renauld was murdered this morning. ” 3 at the villa geneviève in a moment poirot had leapt from the car , his eyes blazing with excitement . he caught the man by the shoulder .
christie	links	“ what is that you say ? murdered ? when ? how ? ” the _sergent de ville___ drew himself up . “ i can not answer any questions , monsieur. ” “ true . i comprehend. ” poirot reflected for a minute . “ the commissary of police , he is without doubt within ? ”
christie	links	“ yes , monsieur. ” poirot took out a card , and scribbled a few words on it . “ _voilà ! ___ will you have the goodness to see that this card is sent in to the commissary at once ? ”
christie	links	the man took it and , turning his head over his shoulder , whistled . in a few seconds a comrade joined him and was handed poirot ’ s message . there was a wait of some minutes , and then a short stout man with a huge moustache came bustling down to the gate . the _sergent de ville___ saluted and stood aside .
christie	links	“ my dear m. poirot , ” cried the new-comer , “ i am delighted to see you . your arrival is most opportune. ” poirot ’ s face had lighted up . “ m . bex ! this is indeed a pleasure. ” he turned to me . “ this is an english friend of mine , captain hastings—m . lucien bex . ”
christie	links	the commissary and i bowed to each other ceremoniously , then m. bex turned once more to poirot . “ _mon vieux___ , i have not seen you since 1909 , that time in ostend . i heard that you had left the force ? ”
christie	links	“ so i have . i run a private business in london. ” “ and you say you have information to give which may assist us ? ” “ possibly you know it already . you were aware that i had been sent for ? ”
christie	links	“ no . by whom ? ” “ the dead man . it seems he knew an attempt was going to be made on his life . unfortunately he sent for me too late. ” “ _sacri tonnerre ! ___ ” ejaculated the frenchman . “ so he foresaw his own murder ? that upsets our theories considerably ! but come inside . ”
christie	links	he held the gate open , and we commenced walking towards the house . m. bex continued to talk : “ the examining magistrate , m. hautet , must hear of this at once . he has just finished examining the scene of the crime and is about to begin his interrogations . a charming man . you will like him . most sympathetic . original in his methods , but an excellent judge . ”
christie	links	“ when was the crime committed ? ” asked poirot . “ the body was discovered this morning about nine o ’ clock . madame renauld ’ s evidence , and that of the doctors goes to show that the death must have occurred about 2 a.m . but enter , i pray of you . ”
christie	links	we had arrived at the steps which led up to the front door of the villa . in the hall another _sergent de ville___ was sitting . he rose at sight of the commissary .
christie	links	“ where is m. hautet now ? ” inquired the latter . “ in the _salon___ , monsieur. ” m. bex opened a door to the left of the hall , and we passed in . m. hautet and his clerk were sitting at a big round table . they looked up as we entered . the commissary introduced us , and explained our presence .
christie	links	m. hautet , the juge d ’ instruction , was a tall , gaunt man , with piercing dark eyes , and a neatly cut grey beard , which he had a habit of caressing as he talked . standing by the mantelpiece was an elderly man , with slightly stooping shoulders , who was introduced to us as dr. durand .
christie	links	“ most extraordinary , ” remarked m. hautet , as the commissary finished speaking . “ you have the letter here , monsieur ? ” poirot handed it to him , and the magistrate read it . “ h ’ m . he speaks of a secret . what a pity he was not more explicit . we are much indebted to you , m. poirot . i hope you will do us the honour of assisting us in our investigations . or are you obliged to return to london ? ”
christie	links	“ m . le juge , i propose to remain . i did not arrive in time to prevent my client ’ s death , but i feel myself bound in honour to discover the assassin. ” the magistrate bowed .
christie	links	“ these sentiments do you honour . also , without doubt , madame renauld will wish to retain your services . we are expecting m. giraud from the sûreté in paris any moment , and i am sure that you and he will be able to give each other mutual assistance in your investigations . in the meantime , i hope that you will do me the honour to be present at my interrogations , and i need hardly say that if there is any assistance you require it is at your disposal . ”
christie	links	“ i thank you , monsieur . you will comprehend that at present i am completely in the dark . i know nothing whatever. ” m. hautet nodded to the commissary , and the latter took up the tale :
christie	links	“ this morning , the old servant françoise , on descending to start her work , found the front door ajar . feeling a momentary alarm as to burglars , she looked into the dining-room , but seeing the silver was safe she thought no more about it , concluding that her master had , without doubt , risen early , and gone for a stroll . ”
christie	links	“ pardon , monsieur , for interrupting , but was that a common practice of his ? ” “ no , it was not , but old françoise has the common idea as regards the english—that they are mad , and liable to do the most unaccountable things at any moment ! going to call her mistress as usual , a younger maid , léonie , was horrified to discover her gagged and bound , and almost at the same moment news was brought that m. renauld ’ s body had been discovered , stone dead , stabbed in the back . ”
christie	links	“ where ? ” “ that is one of the most extraordinary features of the case . m. poirot , the body was lying , face downwards , _in an open grave___. ” “ what ? ” “ yes . the pit was freshly dug—just a few yards outside the boundary of the villa grounds . ”
christie	links	“ and he had been dead—how long ? ” dr. durand answered this . “ i examined the body this morning at ten o ’ clock . death must have taken place at least seven , and possibly ten hours previously . ”
christie	links	“ h ’ m , that fixes it at between midnight and 3 a.m. ” “ exactly , and madame renauld ’ s evidence places it at after 2 a.m. which narrows the field still further . death must have been instantaneous , and naturally could not have been self-inflicted . ”
christie	links	poirot nodded , and the commissary resumed : “ madame renauld was hastily freed from the cords that bound her by the horrified servants . she was in a terrible condition of weakness , almost unconscious from the pain of her bonds . it appears that two masked men entered the bedroom , gagged and bound her , whilst forcibly abducting her husband . this we know at second hand from the servants . on hearing the tragic news , she fell at once into an alarming state of agitation . on arrival , dr. durand immediately prescribed a sedative , and we have not yet been able to question her . but without doubt she will awake more calm , and be equal to bearing the strain of the interrogation . ”
christie	links	the commissary paused . “ and the inmates of the house , monsieur ? ” “ there is old françoise , the housekeeper , she lived for many years with the former owners of the villa geneviève . then there are two young girls , sisters , denise and léonie oulard . their home is in merlinville , and they come of the most respectable parents . then there is the chauffeur whom m. renauld brought over from england with him , but he is away on a holiday . finally there are madame renauld and her son , m. jack renauld . he , too , is away from home at present . ”
christie	links	poirot bowed his head . m. hautet spoke : “ marchaud ! ” the _sergent de ville___ appeared . “ bring in the woman françoise. ” the man saluted , and disappeared . in a moment or two , he returned , escorting the frightened françoise .
christie	links	“ you name is françoise arrichet ? ” “ yes , monsieur. ” “ you have been a long time in service at the villa geneviève ? ” “ eleven years with madame la vicomtesse . then when she sold the villa this spring , i consented to remain on with the english milor . never did i imagine— ”
christie	links	the magistrate cut her short . “ without doubt , without doubt . now , françoise , in this matter of the front door , whose business was it to fasten it at night ? ” “ mine , monsieur . always i saw to it myself . ”
christie	links	“ and last night ? ” “ i fastened it as usual. ” “ you are sure of that ? ” “ i swear it by the blessed saints , monsieur. ” “ what time would that be ? ” “ the same time as usual , half-past ten , monsieur . ”
christie	links	“ what about the rest of the household , had they gone up to bed ? ” “ madame had retired some time before . denise and léonie went up with me . monsieur was still in his study . ”
christie	links	“ then , if any one unfastened the door afterwards , it must have been m. renauld himself ? ” françoise shrugged her broad shoulders . “ what should he do that for ? with robbers and assassins passing every minute ! a nice idea ! monsieur was not an imbecile . it is not as though he had had to let _cette dame___ out— ”
christie	links	the magistrate interrupted sharply : “ _cette dame ? ___ what lady do you mean ? ” “ why , the lady who came to see him. ” “ had a lady been to see him that evening ? ” “ but yes , monsieur—and many other evenings as well . ”
christie	links	“ who was she ? did you know her ? ” a rather cunning look spread over the woman ’ s face . “ how should i know who it was ? ” she grumbled . “ i did not let her in last night . ”
christie	links	“ aha ! ” roared the examining magistrate , bringing his hand down with a bang on the table . “ you would trifle with the police , would you ? i demand that you tell me at once the name of this woman who came to visit m. renauld in the evenings . ”
christie	links	“ the police—the police , ” grumbled françoise . “ never did i think that i should be mixed up with the police . but i know well enough who she was . it was madame daubreuil . ”
christie	links	the commissary uttered an exclamation , and leaned forward as though in utter astonishment . “ madame daubreuil—from the villa marguerite just down the road ? ” “ that is what i said , monsieur . oh , she is a pretty one , _cellela ! ___ ” the old woman tossed her head scornfully .
christie	links	“ madame daubreuil , ” murmured the commissary . “ impossible. ” “ _voilà , ___ ” grumbled françoise . “ that is all you get for telling the truth. ” “ not at all , ” said the examining magistrate soothingly . “ we were surprised , that is all . madame daubreuil then , and monsieur renauld , they were— ” he paused delicately . “ eh ? it was that without doubt ? ”
christie	links	“ how should i know ? but what will you ? monsieur , he was _milor anglais___—_trés riche___—and madame daubreuil , she was poor , that one—and _trés chic___ for all that she lives so quietly with her daughter . not a doubt of it , she has had her history ! she is no longer young , but _ma foi ! ___ i who speak to you have seen the men ’ s heads turn after her as she goes down the street . besides lately , she has had more money to spend—all the town knows it . the little economies , they are at an end. ” and françoise shook her head with an air of unalterable certainty .
christie	links	m. hautet stroked his beard reflectively . “ and madame renauld ? ” he asked at length . “ how did she take this—friendship. ” françoise shrugged her shoulders . “ she was always most amiable—most polite . one would say that she suspected nothing . but all the same , is it not so , the heart suffers , monsieur ? day by day , i have watched madame grow paler and thinner . she was not the same woman who arrived here a month ago . monsieur , too , has changed . he also has had his worries . one could see that he was on the brink of a crisis of the nerves . and who could wonder , with an affair conducted such a fashion ? no reticence , no discretion . _style anglais___ , without doubt ! ”
christie	links	i bounded indignantly in my seat , but the examining magistrate was continuing his questions , undistracted by side issues . “ you say that m. renauld had not to let madame daubreuil out ? had she left , then ? ”
christie	links	“ yes , monsieur . i heard them come out of the study and go to the door . monsieur said good night , and shut the door after her. ” “ what time was that ? ” “ about twenty-five minutes after ten , monsieur . ”
christie	links	“ do you know when m. renauld went to bed ? ” “ i heard him come up about ten minutes after we did . the stair creaks so that one hears every one who goes up and down . ”
christie	links	“ and that is all ? you heard no sound of disturbance during the night ? ” “ nothing whatever , monsieur. ” “ which of the servants came down the first in the morning ? ” “ i did , monsieur . at once i saw the door swinging open . ”
christie	links	“ what about the other downstairs windows , were they all fastened ? ” “ every one of them . there was nothing suspicious or out of place anywhere. ” “ good , françoise , you can go. ” the old woman shuffled towards the door . on the threshold she looked back .
christie	links	“ i will tell you one thing , monsieur . that madame daubreuil she is a bad one ! oh , yes , one woman knows about another . she is a bad one , remember that. ” and , shaking her head sagely , françoise left the room .
christie	links	“ léonie oulard , ” called the magistrate . léonie appeared dissolved in tears , and inclined to be hysterical . m. hautet dealt with her adroitly . her evidence was mainly concerned with the discovery of her mistress gagged and bound , of which she gave rather an exaggerated account . she , like françoise , had heard nothing during the night .
christie	links	her sister , denise , succeeded her . she agreed that her master had changed greatly of late . “ every day he became more and more morose . he ate less . he was always depressed. ” but denise had her own theory . “ without doubt it was the mafia he had on his track ! two masked men—who else could it be ? a terrible society that ! ”
christie	links	“ it is , of course , possible , ” said the magistrate smoothly . “ now , my girl , was it you who admitted madame daubreuil to the house last night ? ” “ not _last___ night , monsieur , the night before . ”
christie	links	“ but françoise has just told us that madame daubreuil was here last night ? ” “ no , monsieur . a lady _did___ come to see m. renauld last night , but it was not madame daubreuil . ”
christie	links	surprised , the magistrate insisted , but the girl held firm . she knew madame daubreuil perfectly by sight . this lady was dark also , but shorter , and much younger . nothing could shake her statement .
christie	links	“ had you ever seen this lady before ? ” “ never , monsieur. ” and then the girl added diffidently : “ but i think she was english. ” “ english ? ” “ yes , monsieur . she asked for m. renauld in quite good french , but the accent—one can always tell it , _n ’ est-ce pas ? ___ besides when they came out of the study they were speaking in english . ”
christie	links	“ did you hear what they said ? could you understand it , i mean ? ” “ me , i speak the english very well , ” said denise with pride . “ the lady was speaking too fast for me to catch what she said , but i heard monsieur ’ s last words as he opened the door for her. ” she paused , and then repeated carefully and laboriously :
christie	links	“ ‘ yeas—yeas—butt for gaud ’ s saike go nauw ! ’ ” “ yes , yes , but for god ’ s sake go now ! ” repeated the magistrate . he dismissed denise and , after a moment or two for consideration , recalled françoise . to her he propounded the question as to whether she had not made a mistake in fixing the night of madame daubreuil ’ s visit . françoise , however , proved unexpectedly obstinate . it was last night that madame daubreuil had come . without a doubt it was she . denise wished to make herself interesting , _voilà tout ! ___ so she had cooked up this fine tale about a strange lady . airing her knowledge of english too ! probably monsieur had never spoken that sentence in english at all , and even if he had , it proved nothing , for madame daubreuil spoke english perfectly , and generally used that language when talking to m. and madame renauld . “ you see , m. jack , the son of monsieur , was usually here , and he spoke the french very badly . ”
christie	links	the magistrate did not insist . instead he inquired about the chauffeur , and learned that only yesterday , m. renauld had declared that he was not likely to use the car , and that masters might just as well take a holiday .
christie	links	a perplexed frown was beginning to gather between poirot ’ s eyes . “ what is it ? ” i whispered . he shook his head impatiently , and asked a question : “ pardon , m. bex , but without doubt m. renauld could drive the car himself ? ”
christie	links	the commissary looked over at françoise , and the old woman replied promptly : “ no , monsieur did not drive himself. ” poirot ’ s frown deepened . “ i wish you would tell me what is worrying you , ” i said impatiently .
christie	links	“ see you not ? in his letter m. renauld speaks of sending the car for me to calais. ” “ perhaps he meant a hired car , ” i suggested . “ doubtless that is so . but why hire a car when you have one of your own . why choose yesterday to send away the chauffeur on a holiday—suddenly , at a moment ’ s notice ? was it that for some reason he wanted him out of the way before we arrived ? ”
christie	links	4 the letter signed “ bella ” françoise had left the room . the magistrate was drumming thoughtfully on the table . “ m . bex , ” he said at length , “ here we have directly conflicting testimony . which are we to believe , françoise or denise ? ”
christie	links	“ denise , ” said the commissary decidedly . “ it was she who let the visitor in . françoise is old and obstinate , and has evidently taken a dislike to madame daubreuil . besides , our own knowledge tends to show that renauld was entangled with another woman . ”
christie	links	“ _tiens ! ___ ” cried m. hautet . “ we have forgotten to inform m. poirot of that. ” he searched amongst the papers on the table , and finally handed the one he was in search of to my friend . “ this letter , m. poirot , we found in the pocket of the dead man ’ s overcoat . ”
christie	links	poirot took it and unfolded it . it was somewhat worn and crumbled , and was written in english in a rather unformed hand : “ _my dearest one : ___ ” why have you not written for so long ? you do love me still , don ’ t you ? your letters lately have been so different , cold and strange , and now this long silence . it makes me afraid . if you were to stop loving me ! but that ’ s impossible—what a silly kid i am—always imagining things ! but if you _did___ stop loving me , i don ’ t know what i should do—kill myself perhaps ! i couldn ’ t live without you . sometimes i fancy another woman is coming between us . let her look out , that ’ s all—and you too ! i ’ d as soon kill you as let her have you ! i mean it . “ but there , i ’ m writing high-flown nonsense . you love me , and i love you—yes , love you , love you , love you !
christie	links	“ your own adoring “ bella. ” there was no address or date . poirot handed it back with a grave face . “ and the assumption is , m. le juge— ? ” the examining magistrate shrugged his shoulders .
christie	links	“ obviously m. renauld was entangled with this englishwoman—bella . he comes over here , meets madame daubreuil , and starts an intrigue with her . he cools off to the other , and she instantly suspects something . this letter contains a distinct threat . m. poirot , at first sight the case seemed simplicity itself . jealousy ! the fact that m. renauld was stabbed in the back seemed to point distinctly to its being a woman ’ s crime . ”
christie	links	poirot nodded . “ the stab in the back , yes—but not the grave ! that was laborious work , hard work—no woman dug that grave , monsieur . that was a man ’ s doing. ” the commissary exclaimed excitedly : “ yes , yes , you are right . we did not think of that . ”
christie	links	“ as i said , ” continued m. hautet , “ at first sight the case seemed simple , but the masked men , and the letter you received from m. renauld complicate matters . here we seem to have an entirely different set of circumstances , with no relationship between the two . as regards the letter written to yourself , do you think it is possible that it referred in any way to this ‘ bella , ’ and her threats ? ”
christie	links	poirot shook his head . “ hardly . a man like m. renauld , who has led an adventurous life in out-of-the-way places , would not be likely to ask for protection against a woman . ”
christie	links	the examining magistrate nodded his head emphatically . “ my view exactly . then we must look for the explanation of the letter— ” “ in santiago , ” finished the commissary . “ i shall cable without delay to the police in that city , requesting full details of the murdered man ’ s life out there , his love affairs , his business transactions , his friendships , and any enmities he may have incurred . it will be strange if , after that , we do not hold a clue to his mysterious murder . ”
christie	links	the commissary looked round for approval . “ excellent , ” said poirot appreciatively . “ his wife , too , may be able to give us a pointer , ” added the magistrate . “ you have found no other letters from this bella amongst m. renauld ’ s effects ? ” asked poirot .
christie	links	“ no . of course one of our first proceedings was to search through his private papers in the study . we found nothing of interest , however . all seemed square and above-board . the only thing at all out of the ordinary was his will . here it is . ”
christie	links	poirot ran through the document . “ so . a legacy of a thousand pounds to mr. stonor—who is he , by the way ? ” “ m . renauld ’ s secretary . he remained in england , but was over here once or twice for a week-end . ”
christie	links	“ and everything else left unconditionally to his beloved wife , eloise . simply drawn up , but perfectly legal . witnessed by the two servants , denise and françoise . nothing so very unusual about that. ” he handed it back .
christie	links	“ perhaps , ” began bex , “ you did not notice— ” “ the date ? ” twinkled poirot . “ but yes , i noticed it . a fortnight ago . possibly it marks his first intimation of danger . many rich men die intestate through never considering the likelihood of their demise . but it is dangerous to draw conclusions prematurely . it points , however , to his having a real liking and fondness for his wife , in spite of his amorous intrigues . ”
christie	links	“ yes , ” said m. hautet doubtfully . “ but it is possibly a little unfair on his son , since it leaves him entirely dependent on his mother . if she were to marry again , and her second husband obtained an ascendancy over her , this boy might never touch a penny of his father ’ s money . ”
christie	links	poirot shrugged his shoulders . “ man is a vain animal . m. renauld figured to himself , without doubt , that his widow would never marry again . as to the son , it may have been a wise precaution to leave the money in his mother ’ s hands . the sons of rich men are proverbially wild . ”
christie	links	“ it may be as you say . now , m. poirot , you would without doubt like to visit the scene of the crime . i am sorry that the body has been removed , but of course photographs have been taken from every conceivable angle , and will be at your disposal as soon as they are available . ”
christie	links	“ i thank you , monsieur , for all your courtesy. ” the commissary rose . “ come with me , monsieurs. ” he opened the door , and bowed ceremoniously to poirot to precede him . poirot , with equal politeness , drew back and bowed to the commissary .
christie	links	“ monsieur. ” “ monsieur. ” at last they got out into the hall . “ that room there , it is the study , _hein ? ___ ” asked poirot suddenly , nodding towards the door opposite . “ yes . you would like to see it ? ” he threw the door open as he spoke , and we entered .
christie	links	the room which m. renauld had chosen for his own particular use was small , but furnished with great taste and comfort . a businesslike writing desk , with many pigeon holes , stood in the window . two large leather-covered armchairs faced the fireplace , and between them was a round table covered with the latest books and magazines . bookshelves lined two of the walls , and at the end of the room opposite the window there was a handsome oak sideboard with a tantalus on top . the curtains and _portière___ were of a soft dull green , and the carpet matched them in tone .
christie	links	poirot stood a moment taking in the room , then he stepped forward , passed his hand lightly over the backs of the leather chairs , picked up a magazine from the table , and drew a finger gingerly over the surface of the oak sideboard . his face expressed complete approval .
christie	links	“ no dust ? ” i asked , with a smile . he beamed on me , appreciative of my knowledge of his peculiarities . “ not a particle , _mon ami ! ___ and for once , perhaps , it is a pity . ”
christie	links	his sharp , birdlike eyes darted here and there . “ ah ! ” he remarked suddenly , with an intonation of relief . “ the hearth-rug is crooked , ” and he bent down to straighten it . suddenly he uttered an exclamation and rose . in his hand he held a small fragment of paper .
christie	links	“ in france , as in england , ” he remarked , “ the domestics omit to sweep under the mats ! ” bex took the fragment from him , and i came closer to examine it . “ you recognize it—eh , hastings ? ”
christie	links	i shook my head , puzzled—and yet that particular shade of pink paper was very familiar . the commissary ’ s mental processes were quicker than mine . “ a fragment of a cheque , ” he exclaimed .
christie	links	the piece of paper was roughly about two inches square . on it was written in ink the word “ duveen. ” “ _bien___ , ” said bex . “ this cheque was payable to , or drawn by , one named duveen . ”
christie	links	“ the former , i fancy , ” said poirot , “ for , if i am not mistaken , the handwriting is that of m. renauld. ” that was soon established , by comparing it with a memorandum from the desk .
christie	links	“ dear me , ” murmured the commissary , with a crestfallen air , “ i really can not imagine how i came to overlook this. ” poirot laughed . “ the moral of that is , always look under the mats ! my friend hastings here will tell you that anything in the least crooked is a torment to me . as soon as i saw that the hearth-rug was out of the straight , i said to myself : ‘ _tiens ! ___ the leg of the chair caught it in being pushed back . possibly there may be something beneath it which the good françoise overlooked . ’ ”
christie	links	“ françoise ? ” “ or denise , or léonie . whoever did this room . since there is no dust , the room _must___ have been done this morning . i reconstruct the incident like this . yesterday , possibly last night , m. renauld drew a cheque to the order of some one named duveen . afterwards it was torn up , and scattered on the floor . this morning— ” but m. bex was already pulling impatiently at the bell .
christie	links	françoise answered it . yes , there had been a lot of pieces of paper on the floor . what had she done with them ? put them in the kitchen stove of course ! what else ?
christie	links	with a gesture of despair , bex dismissed her . then , his face lightening , he ran to the desk . in a minute he was hunting through the dead man ’ s cheque book . then he repeated his former gesture . the last counterfoil was blank .
christie	links	“ courage ! ” cried poirot , clapping him on the back . “ without doubt , madame renauld will be able to tell us all about this mysterious person named duveen. ” the commissary ’ s face cleared . “ that is true . let us proceed . ”
christie	links	as we turned to leave the room , poirot remarked casually : “ it was here that m. renauld received his guest last night , eh ? ” “ it was—but how did you know ? ” “ by _this___ . i found it on the back of the leather chair . ”
christie	links	and he held up between his finger and thumb a long black hair—a woman ’ s hair ! m. bex took us out by the back of the house to where there was a small shed leaning against the house . he produced a key from his pocket and unlocked it .
christie	links	“ the body is here . we moved it from the scene of the crime just before you arrived , as the photographers had done with it. ” he opened the door and we passed in . the murdered man lay on the ground , with a sheet over him . m. bex dexterously whipped off the covering . renauld was a man of medium height , slender and lithe in figure . he looked about fifty years of age , and his dark hair was plentifully streaked with grey . he was clean shaven with a long thin nose , and eyes set rather close together , and his skin was deeply bronzed , as that of a man who had spent most of his life beneath tropical skies . his lips were drawn back from his teeth and an expression of absolute amazement and terror was stamped on the livid features .
christie	links	“ one can see by his face that he was stabbed in the back , ” remarked poirot . very gently , he turned the dead man over . there , between the shoulder-blades , staining the light fawn overcoat , was a round dark patch . in the middle of it there was a slit in the cloth . poirot examined it narrowly .
christie	links	“ have you any idea with what weapon the crime was committed ? ” “ it was left in the wound. ” the commissary reached down a large glass jar . in it was a small object that looked to me more like a paper-knife than anything else . it had a black handle , and a narrow shining blade . the whole thing was not more than ten inches long . poirot tested the discoloured point gingerly with his finger tip .
christie	links	“ _ma foi ! ___ but it is sharp ! a nice easy little tool for murder ! ” “ unfortunately , we could find no trace of fingerprints on it , ” remarked bex regretfully . “ the murderer must have worn gloves . ”
christie	links	“ of course he did , ” said poirot contemptuously . “ even in santiago they know enough for that . the veriest amateur of an english mees knows it—thanks to the publicity the bertillon system has been given in the press . all the same , it interests me very much that there were no finger-prints . it is so amazingly simple to leave the finger-prints of some one else ! and then the police are happy. ” he shook his head . “ i very much fear our criminal is not a man of method—either that or he was pressed for time . but we shall see . ”
christie	links	he let the body fall back into its original position . “ he wore only underclothes under his overcoat , i see , ” he remarked . “ yes , the examining magistrate thinks that is rather a curious point . ”
christie	links	at this minute there was a tap on the door which bex had closed after him . he strode forward and opened it . françoise was there . she endeavoured to peep in with ghoulish curiosity .
christie	links	“ well , what is it ? ” demanded bex impatiently . “ madame . she sends a message that she is much recovered , and is quite ready to receive the examining magistrate. ” “ good , ” said m. bex briskly . “ tell m. hautet and say that we will come at once . ”
christie	links	poirot lingered a moment , looking back towards the body . i thought for a moment that he was going to apostrophize it , to declare aloud his determination never to rest till he had discovered the murderer . but when he spoke , it was tamely and awkwardly , and his comment was ludicrously inappropriate to the solemnity of the moment .
christie	links	“ he wore his overcoat very long , ” he said constrainedly . 5 mrs. renauld ’ s story we found m. hautet awaiting us in the hall , and we all proceeded upstairs together , françoise marching ahead to show us the way . poirot went up in a zigzag fashion which puzzled me , until he whispered with a grimace :
christie	links	“ no wonder the servants heard m. renauld mounting the stairs ; not a board of them but creaks fit to wake the dead ! ” at the head of the staircase , a small passage branched off .
christie	links	“ the servants ’ quarters , ” explained bex . we continued along a corridor , and françoise tapped on the last door to the right of it . a faint voice bade us enter , and we passed into a large sunny apartment looking out towards the sea , which showed blue and sparkling about a quarter of a mile distant .
christie	links	on a couch , propped up with cushions , and attended by dr. durand , lay a tall , striking-looking woman . she was middle-aged , and her once dark hair was now almost entirely silvered , but the intense vitality and strength of her personality would have made itself felt anywhere . you knew at once that you were in the presence of what the french call “ _une maitresse femme___ . ”
christie	links	she greeted us with a dignified inclination of the head . “ pray be seated , monsieurs. ” we took chairs , and the magistrate ’ s clerk established himself at a round table . “ i hope , madame , ” began m. hautet , “ that it will not distress you unduly to relate to us what occurred last night ? ”
christie	links	“ not at all , monsieur . i know the value of time , if these scoundrelly assassins are to be caught and punished. ” “ very well , madame . it will fatigue you less , i think , if i ask you questions and you confine yourself to answering them . at what time did you go to bed last night ? ”
christie	links	“ at half-past nine , monsieur . i was tired. ” “ and your husband ? ” “ about an hour later , i fancy. ” “ did he seem disturbed—upset in any way ? ” “ no , not more than usual. ” “ what happened then ? ”
christie	links	“ we slept . i was awakened by a hand being pressed over my mouth . i tried to scream out , but the hand prevented me . there were two men in the room . they were both masked . ”
christie	links	“ can you describe them at all , madame ? ” “ one was very tall , and had a long black beard , the other was short and stout . his beard was reddish . they both wore hats pulled down over their eyes . ”
christie	links	“ h ’ m , ” said the magistrate thoughtfully , “ too much beard , i fear. ” “ you mean they were false ? ” “ yes , madame . but continue your story. ” “ it was the short man who was holding me . he forced a gag into my mouth , and then bound me with rope hand and foot . the other man was standing over my husband . he had caught up my little dagger paper-knife from the dressing-table and was holding it with the point just over his heart . when the short man had finished with me , he joined the other , and they forced my husband to get up and accompany them into the dressing-room next door . i was nearly fainting with terror , nevertheless i listened desperately .
christie	links	“ they were speaking in too low a tone for me to hear what they said . but i recognized the language , a bastard spanish such as is spoken in some parts of south america . they seemed to be demanding something from my husband , and presently they grew angry , and their voices rose a little . i think the tall man was speaking . ‘ you know what we want ! ’ he said . ‘ _the secret ! ___ where is it ? ’ i do not know what my husband answered , but the other replied fiercely : ‘ you lie ! we know you have it . where are your keys ? ’
christie	links	“ then i heard sounds of drawers being pulled out . there is a safe on the wall of my husband ’ s dressing-room in which he always keeps a fairly large amount of ready money . léonie tells me this has been rifled and the money taken , but evidently what they were looking for was not there , for presently i heard the tall man , with an oath , command my husband to dress himself . soon after that , i think some noise in the house must have disturbed them , for they hustled my husband out into my room only half dressed . ”
christie	links	“ _pardon___ , ” interrupted poirot , “ but is there then no other egress from the dressing-room ? ” “ no , monsieur , there is only the communicating door into my room . they hurried my husband through , the short man in front , and the tall man behind him with the dagger still in his hand . paul tried to break away to come to me . i saw his agonized eyes . he turned to his captors . ‘ i must speak to her , ’ he said . then , coming to the side of the bed , ‘ it is all right , eloise , ’ he said . ‘ do not be afraid . i shall return before morning. ’ but , although he tried to make his voice confident , i could see the terror in his eyes . then they hustled him out of the door , the tall man saying : ‘ one sound—and you are a dead man , remember . ’
christie	links	“ after that , ” continued mrs. renauld , “ i must have fainted . the next thing i recollect is léonie rubbing my wrists , and giving me brandy. ” “ madame renauld , ” said the magistrate , “ had you any idea what it was for which the assassins were searching ? ”
christie	links	“ none whatever , monsieur. ” “ had you any knowledge that your husband feared something ? ” “ yes . i had seen the change in him. ” “ how long ago was that ? ” mrs. renauld reflected . “ ten days perhaps . ”
christie	links	“ not longer ? ” “ possibly . i only noticed it then. ” “ did you question your husband at all as to the cause ? ” “ once . he put me off evasively . nevertheless , i was convinced that he was suffering some terrible anxiety . however , since he evidently wished to conceal the fact from me , i tried to pretend that i had noticed nothing . ”
christie	links	“ were you aware that he had called in the services of a detective ? ” “ a detective ? ” exclaimed mrs. renauld , very much surprised . “ yes , this gentleman—m . hercule poirot. ” poirot bowed . “ he arrived today in response to a summons from your husband. ” and taking the letter written by m. renauld from his pocket he handed it to the lady .
christie	links	she read it with apparently genuine astonishment . “ i had no idea of this . evidently he was fully cognizant of the danger. ” “ now , madame , i will beg of you to be frank with me . is there any incident in your husband ’ s past life in south america which might throw light on his murder ? ”
christie	links	mrs. renauld reflected deeply , but at last shook her head . “ i can think of none . certainly my husband had many enemies , people he had got the better of in some way or another , but i can think of no one distinctive case . i do not say there is no such incident—only that i am not aware of it . ”
christie	links	the examining magistrate stroked his beard disconsolately . “ and you can fix the time of this outrage ? ” “ yes , i distinctly remember hearing the clock on the mantelpiece strike two. ” she nodded towards an eight-day travelling clock in a leather case which stood in the centre of the chimney-piece .
christie	links	poirot rose from his seat , scrutinized the clock carefully , and nodded , satisfied . “ and here too , ” exclaimed m. bex , “ is a wrist watch , knocked off the dressing-table by the assassins , without doubt , and smashed to atoms . little did they know it would testify against them . ”
christie	links	gently he picked away the fragments of broken glass . suddenly his face changed to one of utter stupefaction . “ _mon dieu ! ___ ” he ejaculated . “ what is it ? ” “ the hands of the watch point to seven o ’ clock ! ”
christie	links	“ what ? ” cried the examining magistrate , astonished . but poirot , deft as ever , took the broken trinket from the startled commissary , and held it to his ear . then he smiled . “ the glass is broken , yes , but the watch itself is still going . ”
christie	links	the explanation of the mystery was greeted with a relieved smile . but the magistrate bethought him of another point . “ but surely it is not seven o ’ clock now ? ” “ no , ” said poirot gently , “ it is a few minutes after five . possibly the watch gains , is that so , madame ? ”
christie	links	mrs. renauld was frowning perplexedly . “ it does gain , ” she admitted , “ but i ’ ve never known it to gain quite so much as that. ” with a gesture of impatience , the magistrate left the matter of the watch and proceeded with his interrogatory .
christie	links	“ madame , the front door was found ajar . it seems almost certain that the murderers entered that way , yet it has not been forced at all . can you suggest any explanation ? ”
christie	links	“ possibly my husband went out for a stroll the last thing , and forgot to latch it when he came in. ” “ is that a likely thing to happen ? ” “ very . my husband was the most absent-minded of men . ”
christie	links	there was a slight frown on her brow as she spoke , as though this trait in the dead man ’ s character had at times vexed her . “ there is one inference i think we might draw , ” remarked the commissary suddenly . “ since the men insisted on m. renauld dressing himself , it looks as though the place they were taking him to , the place where ‘ the secret ’ was concealed , lay some distance away . ”
christie	links	the magistrate nodded . “ yes , far , and yet not too far , since he spoke of being back by morning. ” “ what times does the last train leave the station of merlinville ? ” asked poirot .
christie	links	“ eleven-fifty one way , and 12:17 the other , but it is more probable that they had a motor waiting. ” “ of course , ” agreed poirot , looking somewhat crestfallen . “ indeed , that might be one way of tracing them , ” continued the magistrate , brightening . “ a motor containing two foreigners is quite likely to have been noticed . that is an excellent point , m. bex . ”
christie	links	he smiled to himself , and then , becoming grave once more , he said to mrs. renauld : “ there is another question . do you know any one of the name of ‘ duveen ’ ? ” “ duveen ? ” mrs. renauld repeated , thoughtfully . “ no , for the moment , i can not say i do . ”
christie	links	“ you have never heard your husband mention any one of that name ? ” “ never. ” “ do you know any one whose christian name is bella ? ” he watched mrs. renauld narrowly as he spoke , seeking to surprise any signs of anger or consciousness , but she merely shook her head in quite a natural manner . he continued his questions .
christie	links	“ are you aware that your husband had a visitor last night ? ” now he saw the red mount slightly in her cheeks , but she replied composedly . “ no , who was that ? ” “ a lady . ”
christie	links	“ indeed ? ” but for the moment the magistrate was content to say no more . it seemed unlikely that madame daubreuil had any connection with the crime , and he was anxious not to upset mrs. renauld more than necessary .
christie	links	he made a sign to the commissary , and the latter replied with a nod . then rising , he went across the room , and returned with the glass jar we had seen in the outhouse in his hand . from this , he took the dagger .
christie	links	“ madame , ” he said gently , “ do you recognize this ? ” she gave a little cry . “ yes , that is my little dagger. ” then—she saw the stained point , and she drew back , her eyes widening with horror . “ is that—blood ? ”
christie	links	“ yes , madame . your husband was killed with this weapon. ” he removed it hastily from sight . “ you are quite sure about it ’ s being the one that was on your dressing-table last night ? ”
christie	links	“ oh , yes . it was a present from my son . he was in the air force during the war . he gave his age as older than it was. ” there was a touch of the proud mother in her voice . “ this was made from a streamline aeroplane wire , and was given to me by my son as a souvenir of the war . ”
christie	links	“ i see , madame . that brings us to another matter . your son , where is he now ? it is necessary that he should be telegraphed to without delay. ” “ jack ? he is on his way to buenos ayres . ”
christie	links	“ what ? ” “ yes . my husband telegraphed to him yesterday . he had sent him on business to paris , but yesterday he discovered that it would be necessary for him to proceed without delay to south america . there was a boat leaving cherbourg for buenos ayres last night , and he wired him to catch it . ”
christie	links	“ have you any knowledge of what the business in buenos ayres was ? ” “ no , monsieur , i know nothing of its nature , but buenos ayres is not my son ’ s final destination . he was going overland from there to santiago . ”
christie	links	and , in unison , the magistrate and the commissary exclaimed : “ santiago ! again santiago ! ” it was at this moment , when we were all stunned by the mention of that word , that poirot approached mrs. renauld . he had been standing by the window like a man lost in a dream , and i doubt if he had fully taken in what had passed . he paused by the lady ’ s side with a bow .
christie	links	“ _pardon___ , madame , but may i examine your wrists. ” though slightly surprised at the request , mrs. renauld held them out to him . round each of them was a cruel red mark where the cords had bitten into the flesh . as he examined them , i fancied that a momentary flicker of excitement i had seen in his eyes disappeared .
christie	links	“ they must cause you great pain , ” he said , and once more he looked puzzled . but the magistrate was speaking excitedly . “ young m. renauld must be communicated with at once by wireless . it is vital that we should know anything he can tell us about this trip to santiago. ” he hesitated . “ i hoped he might have been near at hand , so that we could have saved you pain , madame. ” he paused .
christie	links	“ you mean , ” she said in a low voice , “ the identification of my husband ’ s body ? ” the magistrate bowed his head . “ i am a strong woman , monsieur . i can bear all that is required of me . i am ready—now . ”
christie	links	“ oh , tomorrow will be quite soon enough , i assure you— ” “ i prefer to get it over , ” she said in a low tone , a spasm of pain crossing her face . “ if you will be so good as to give me your arm , doctor ? ”
christie	links	the doctor hastened forward , a cloak was thrown over mrs. renauld ’ s shoulders , and a slow procession went down the stairs . m. bex hurried on ahead to open the door of the shed . in a minute or two mrs. renauld appeared in the doorway . she was very pale , but resolute . behind her , m. hautet was clacking commiserations and apologies like an animated hen .
christie	links	she raised her hand to her face . “ a moment , messieurs , while i steel myself. ” she took her hand away and looked down at the dead man . then the marvellous self-control which had upheld her so far deserted her .
christie	links	“ paul ! ” she cried . “ husband ! oh , god ! ” and pitching forward she fell unconscious to the ground . instantly poirot was beside her , he raised the lid of her eye , felt her pulse . when he had satisfied himself that she had really fainted , he drew aside . he caught me by the arm .
christie	links	“ i am an imbecile , my friend ! if ever there was love and grief in a woman ’ s voice , i heard it then . my little idea was all wrong . _eh bien ! ___ i must start again ! ”
christie	links	6 the scene of the crime between them , the doctor and m. hautet carried the unconscious woman into the house . the commissary looked after them , shaking his head . “ _pauvre femme___ , ” he murmured to himself . “ the shock was too much for her . well , well , we can do nothing . now , m. poirot , shall we visit the place where the crime was committed ? ”
christie	links	“ if you please , m. bex. ” we passed through the house , and out by the front door . poirot had looked up at the staircase in passing , and shook his head in a dissatisfied manner .
christie	links	“ it is to me incredible that the servants heard nothing . the creaking of that staircase , with _three___ people descending it , would awaken the dead ! ” “ it was the middle of the night , remember . they were sound asleep by then . ”
christie	links	but poirot continued to shake his head as though not fully accepting the explanation . on the sweep of the drive , he paused , looking up at the house . “ what moved them in the first place to try if the front door were open ? it was a most unlikely thing that it should be . it was far more probable that they should at once try to force a window . ”
christie	links	“ but all the windows on the ground floor are barred with iron shutters , ” objected the commissary . poirot pointed to a window on the first floor . “ that is the window of the bedroom we have just come from , is it not ? and see—there is a tree by which it would be the easiest thing in the world to mount . ”
christie	links	“ possibly , ” admitted the other . “ but they could not have done so without leaving footprints in the flower-bed. ” i saw the justice of his words . there were two large oval flower-beds planted with scarlet geraniums , one each side of the steps leading up to the front door . the tree in question had its roots actually at the back of the bed itself , and it would have been impossible to reach it without stepping on the bed .
christie	links	“ you see , ” continued the commissary , “ owing to the dry weather no prints would show on the drive or paths ; but , on the soft mould of the flower-bed , it would have been a very different affair . ”
christie	links	poirot went close to the bed and studied it attentively . as bex had said , the mould was perfectly smooth . there was not an indentation on it anywhere . poirot nodded , as though convinced , and we turned away , but he suddenly darted off and began examining the other flower-bed .
christie	links	“ m . bex ! ” he called . “ see here . here are plenty of traces for you. ” the commissary joined him—and smiled . “ my dear m. poirot , those are without doubt the footprints of the gardener ’ s large hobnailed boots . in any case , it would have no importance , since this side we have no tree , and consequently no means of gaining access to the upper story . ”
christie	links	“ true , ” said poirot , evidently crestfallen . “ so you think these footprints are of no importance ? ” “ not the least in the world. ” then , to my utter astonishment , poirot pronounced these words : “ i do not agree with you . i have a little idea that these footprints are the most important things we have seen yet . ”
christie	links	m. bex said nothing , merely shrugged his shoulders . he was far too courteous to utter his real opinion . “ shall we proceed ? ” he asked instead . “ certainly . i can investigate this matter of the footprints later , ” said poirot cheerfully .
christie	links	instead of following the drive down to the gate , m. bex turned up a path that branched off at right angles . it led , up a slight incline , round to the right of the house , and was bordered on either side by a kind of shrubbery . suddenly it emerged into a little clearing from which one obtained a view of the sea . a seat had been placed here , and not far from it was a rather ramshackle shed . a few steps further on , a neat line of small bushes marked the boundary of the villa grounds . m. bex pushed his way through these and we found ourselves on a wide stretch of open downs . i looked round , and saw something that filled me with astonishment .
christie	links	“ why , this is a golf course , ” i cried . bex nodded . “ the limits are not completed yet , ” he explained . “ it is hoped to be able to open them sometime next month . it was some of the men working on them who discovered the body early this morning . ”
christie	links	i gave a gasp . a little to my left , where for the moment i had overlooked it , was a long narrow pit , and by it , face downwards , was the body of a man ! for a moment , my heart gave a terrible leap , and i had a wild fancy that the tragedy had been duplicated . but the commissary dispelled my illusion by moving forward with a sharp exclamation of annoyance :
christie	links	“ what have my police been about ? they had strict orders to allow no one near the place without proper credentials ! ” the man on the ground turned his head over his shoulder .
christie	links	“ but i have proper credentials , ” he remarked , and rose slowly to his feet . “ my dear m. giraud , ” cried the commissary . “ i had no idea that you had arrived , even . the examining magistrate has been awaiting you with the utmost impatience . ”
christie	links	as he spoke , i was scanning the new-comer with the keenest curiosity . the famous detective from the paris sûreté was familiar to me by name , and i was extremely interested to see him in the flesh . he was very tall , perhaps about thirty years of age , with auburn hair and moustache , and a military carriage . there was a trace of arrogance in his manner which showed that he was fully alive to his own importance . bex introduced us , presenting poirot as a colleague . a flicker of interest came into the detective ’ s eye .
christie	links	“ i know you by name , m. poirot , ” he said . “ you cut quite a figure in the old days , didn ’ t you ? but methods are very different now. ” “ crimes , though , are very much the same , ” remarked poirot gently .
christie	links	i saw at once that giraud was prepared to be hostile . he resented the other being associated with him , and i felt that if he came across any clue of importance he would be more than likely to keep it to himself .
christie	links	“ the examining magistrate— ” began bex again . but giraud interrupted him rudely : “ a fig for the examining magistrate ! the light is the important thing . for all practical purposes it will be gone in another half-hour or so . i know all about the case , and the people at the house will do very well until tomorrow , but , if we ’ re going to find a clue to the murderers , here is the spot we shall find it . is it your police who have been trampling all over the place ? i thought they knew better nowadays . ”
christie	links	“ assuredly they do . the marks you complain of were made by the workmen who discovered the body. ” the other grunted disgustedly . “ i can see the tracks where the three of them came through the hedge—but they were cunning . you can just recognize the centre footmarks as those of m. renauld , but those on either side have been carefully obliterated . not that there would really be much to see anyway on this hard ground , but they weren ’ t taking any chances . ”
christie	links	“ the external sign , ” said poirot . “ that is what you seek , eh ? ” the other detective stared . “ of course. ” a very faint smile came to poirot ’ s lips . he seemed about to speak , but checked himself . he bent down to where a spade was lying .
christie	links	“ that ’ s what the grave was dug with , right enough , ” said giraud . “ but you ’ ll get nothing from it . it was renauld ’ s own spade , and the man who used it wore gloves . here they are. ” he gesticulated with his foot to where two soiled earth-stained gloves were lying . “ and they ’ re renauld ’ s too—or at least his gardener ’ s . i tell you , the men who planned out this crime were taking no chances . the man was stabbed with his own dagger , and would have been buried with his own spade . they counted on leaving no traces ! but i ’ ll beat them . there ’ s always _something ! ___ and i mean to find it . ”
christie	links	but poirot was now apparently interested in something else , a short discoloured piece of lead-piping which lay beside the spade . he touched it delicately with his finger . “ and does this , too , belong to the murdered man ? ” he asked , and i thought i detected a subtle flavour of irony in the question .
christie	links	giraud shrugged his shoulders to indicate that he neither knew nor cared . “ may have been lying around here for weeks . anyway , it doesn ’ t interest me. ” “ i , on the contrary , find it very interesting , ” said poirot sweetly .
christie	links	i guessed that he was merely bent on annoying the paris detective and , if so , he succeeded . the other turned away rudely , remarking that he had no time to waste , and bending down he resumed his minute search of the ground .
christie	links	meanwhile poirot , as though struck by a sudden idea , stepped back over the boundary , and tried the door of the little shed . “ that ’ s locked , ” said giraud over his shoulder . “ but it ’ s only a place where the gardener keeps his rubbish . the spade didn ’ t come from there , but from the toolshed up by the house . ”
christie	links	“ marvellous , ” murmured m. bex , to me ecstatically . “ he has been here but half an hour , and he already knows everything ! what a man ! undoubtedly giraud is the greatest detective alive today . ”
christie	links	although i disliked the detective heartily , i nevertheless was secretly impressed . efficiency seemed to radiate from the man . i could not help feeling that , so far , poirot had not greatly distinguished himself , and it vexed me . he seemed to be directing his attention to all sorts of silly , puerile points that had nothing to do with the case . indeed , at this juncture , he suddenly asked :
christie	links	“ m . bex , tell me , i pray you , the meaning of this whitewashed line that extends all round the grave . is it a device of the police ? ” “ no , m. poirot , it is an affair of the golf course . it shows that there is here to be a ‘ bunkair , ’ as you call it . ”
christie	links	“ a bunkair ? ” poirot turned to me . “ that is the irregular hole filled with sand and a bank at one side , is it not ? ” i concurred . “ you do not play the golf , m. poirot ? ” inquired bex .
christie	links	“ i ? never ! what a game ! ” he became excited . “ figure to yourself , each hole it is of a different length . the obstacles , they are not arranged mathematically . even the greens are frequently up one side ! there is only one pleasing thing—the how do you call them ? —tee boxes ! they , at least , are symmetrical . ”
christie	links	i could not refrain from a laugh at the way the game appeared to poirot , and my little friend smiled at me affectionately , bearing no malice . then he asked : “ but m. renauld , without doubt he played the golf ? ”
christie	links	“ yes , he was a keen golfer . it ’ s mainly owing to him , and to his large subscriptions , that this work is being carried forward . he even had a say in the designing of it . ”
christie	links	poirot nodded thoughtfully . then he remarked : “ it was not a very good choice they made—of a spot to bury the body ? when the men began to dig up the ground , all would have been discovered . ”
christie	links	“ exactly , ” cried giraud triumphantly . “ and that _proves___ that they were strangers to the place . it ’ s an excellent piece of indirect evidence. ” “ yes , ” said poirot doubtfully . “ no one who knew would bury a body there—unless—unless—they _wanted___ it to be discovered . and that is clearly absurd , is it not ? ”
christie	links	giraud did not even trouble to reply . “ yes , ” said poirot , in a somewhat dissatisfied voice . “ yes—undoubtedly—absurd ! ” 7 the mysterious madame daubreuil as we retraced our steps to the house , m. bex excused himself for leaving us , explaining that he must immediately acquaint the examining magistrate with the fact of giraud ’ s arrival . giraud himself had been obviously delighted when poirot declared that he had seen all he wanted . the last thing we observed , as we left the spot , was giraud , crawling about on all fours , with a thoroughness in his search that i could not but admire . poirot guessed my thoughts , for as soon as we were alone he remarked ironically :
christie	links	“ at last you have seen the detective you admire—the human foxhound ! is it not so , my friend ? ” “ at any rate , he ’ s _doing___ something , ” i said , with asperity . “ if there ’ s anything to find , he ’ ll find it . now you— ”
christie	links	“ _eh bien ! ___ i also have found something ! a piece of lead-piping. ” “ nonsense , poirot . you know very well that ’ s got nothing to do with it . i meant _little___ things—traces that may lead us infallibly to the murderers . ”
christie	links	“ _mon ami___ , a clue of two feet long is every bit as valuable as one measuring two millimetres ! but it is the romantic idea that all important clues must be infinitesimal ! as to the piece of lead-piping having nothing to do with the crime , you say that because giraud told you so . no ” —as i was about to interpose a question— “ we will say no more . leave giraud to his search , and me to my ideas . the case seems straightforward enough—and yet—and yet , _mon ami___ , i am not satisfied ! and do you know why ? because of the wrist watch that is two hours fast . and then there are several curious little points that do not seem to fit in . for instance , if the object of the murderers was revenge , why did they not stab renauld in his sleep and have done with it ? ”
christie	links	“ they wanted the ‘ secret , ’ ” i reminded him . poirot brushed a speck of dust from his sleeve with a dissatisfied air . “ well , where is this ‘ secret ’ ? presumably some distance away , since they wish him to dress himself . yet he is found murdered close at hand , almost within ear-shot of the house . then again , it is pure chance that a weapon such as the dagger should be lying about casually , ready to hand . ”
christie	links	he paused frowning , and then went on : “ why did the servants hear nothing ? were they drugged ? was there an accomplice and did that accomplice see to it that the front door should remain open ? i wonder if— ”
christie	links	he stopped abruptly . we had reached the drive in front of the house . suddenly he turned to me . “ my friend , i am about to surprise you—to please you ! i have taken your reproaches to heart ! we will examine some footprints ! ”
christie	links	“ where ? ” “ in that right-hand bed yonder . m. bex says that they are the footmarks of the gardener . let us see if that is so . see , he approaches with his wheelbarrow . ”
christie	links	indeed an elderly man was just crossing the drive with a barrowful of seedlings . poirot called to him , and he set down the barrow and came hobbling towards us . “ you are going to ask him for one of his boots to compare with the footmarks ? ” i asked breathlessly . my faith in poirot revived a little . since he said the footprints in this right-hand bed were important , presumably they _were___ .
christie	links	“ exactly , ” said poirot . “ but won ’ t he think it very odd ? ” “ he will not think about it at all. ” we could say no more , for the old man had joined us .
christie	links	“ you want me for something , monsieur ? ” “ yes . you have been gardener here a long time , haven ’ t you ? ” “ twenty-four years , monsieur. ” “ and your name is— ? ” “ auguste , monsieur. ” “ i was admiring these magnificent geraniums . they are truly superb . they have been planted long ? ”
christie	links	“ some time , monsieur . but of course , to keep the beds looking smart , one must keep bedding out a few new plants , and remove those that are over , besides keeping the old blooms well picked off . ”
christie	links	“ you put in some new plants yesterday , didn ’ t you ? those in the middle there , and in the other bed also ? ” “ monsieur has a sharp eye . it takes always a day or so for them to ‘ pick up. ’ yes , i put ten new plants in each bed last night . as monsieur doubtless knows , one should not put in plants when the sun is hot . ”
christie	links	auguste was charmed with poirot ’ s interest , and was quite inclined to be garrulous . “ that is a splendid specimen there , ” said poirot , pointing . “ might i perhaps have a cutting of it ? ”
christie	links	“ but certainly , monsieur. ” the old fellow stepped into the bed , and carefully took a slip from the plant poirot had admired . poirot was profuse in his thanks , and auguste departed to his barrow .
christie	links	“ you see ? ” said poirot with a smile , as he bent over the bed to examine the indentation of the gardener ’ s hobnailed boot . “ it is quite simple. ” “ i did not realize— ”
christie	links	“ that the foot would be inside the boot ? you do not use your excellent mental capacities sufficiently . well , what of the footmark ? ” i examined the bed carefully . “ all the footmarks in the bed were made by the same boot , ” i said at length after a careful study .
christie	links	“ you think so ? _eh bien___ , i agree with you , ” said poirot . he seemed quite uninterested , and as though he were thinking of something else . “ at any rate , ” i remarked , “ you will have one bee less in your bonnet now . ”
christie	links	“ _mon dieu ! ___ but what an idiom ! what does it mean ? ” “ what i meant was that now you will give up your interest in these footmarks. ” but to my surprise poirot shook his head .
christie	links	“ no , no , _mon ami___ . at last i am on the right track . i am still in the dark , but , as i hinted just now to m. bex , these footmarks are the most important and interesting things in the case ! that poor giraud—i should not be surprised if he took no notice of them whatever . ”
christie	links	at that moment , the front door opened , and m. hautet and the commissary came down the steps . “ ah , m. poirot , we were coming to look for you , ” said the magistrate . “ it is getting late , but i wish to pay a visit to madame daubreuil . without doubt she will be very much upset by m. renauld ’ s death , and we may be fortunate enough to get a clue from her . the secret that he did not confide to his wife , it is possible that he may have told it to the woman whose love held him enslaved . we know where our samsons are weak , don ’ t we ? ”
christie	links	i admired the picturesqueness of m. hautet ’ s language . i suspected that the examining magistrate was by now thoroughly enjoying his part in the mysterious drama . “ is m. giraud not going to accompany us ? ” asked poirot .
christie	links	“ m . giraud has shown clearly that he prefers to conduct the case in his own way , ” said m. hautet dryly . one could see easily enough that giraud ’ s cavalier treatment of the examining magistrate had not prejudiced the latter in his favour . we said no more , but fell into line . poirot walked with the examining magistrate , and the commissary and i followed a few paces behind .
christie	links	“ there is no doubt that françoise ’ s story is substantially correct , ” he remarked to me in a confidential tone . “ i have been telephoning headquarters . it seems that three times in the last six weeks—that is to say since the arrival of m. renauld at merlinville—madame daubreuil has paid a large sum in notes into her banking account . altogether the sum totals two hundred thousand francs ! ”
christie	links	“ dear me , ” i said , considering , “ that must be something like four thousand pounds ! ” “ precisely . yes , there can be no doubt that he was absolutely infatuated . but it remains to be seen whether he confided his secret to her . the examining magistrate is hopeful , but i hardly share his views . ”
christie	links	during this conversation we were walking down the lane towards the fork in the road where our car had halted earlier in the afternoon , and in another moment i realized that the villa marguerite , the home of the mysterious madame daubreuil , was the small house from which the beautiful girl had emerged .
christie	links	“ she has lived here for many years , ” said the commissary , nodding his head towards the house . “ very quietly , very unobtrusively . she seems to have no friends or relations other than the acquaintances she has made in merlinville . she never refers to the past , nor to her husband . one does not even know if he is alive or dead . there is a mystery about her , you comprehend. ” i nodded , my interest growing .
christie	links	“ and—the daughter ? ” i ventured . “ a truly beautiful young girl—modest , devout , all that she should be . one pities her , for , though she may know nothing of the past , a man who wants to ask her hand in marriage must necessarily inform himself , and then— ” the commissary shrugged his shoulders cynically .
christie	links	“ but it would not be her fault ! ” i cried , with rising indignation . “ no . but what will you ? a man is particular about his wife ’ s antecedents. ” i was prevented from further argument by our arrival at the door . m. hautet rang the bell . a few minutes elapsed , and then we heard a footfall within , and the door was opened . on the threshold stood my young goddess of that afternoon . when she saw us , the colour left her cheeks , leaving her deathly white , and her eyes widened with apprehension . there was no doubt about it , she was afraid !
christie	links	“ mademoiselle daubreuil , ” said m. hautet , sweeping off his hat , “ we regret infinitely to disturb you , but the exigencies of the law—you comprehend ? my compliments to madame your mother , and will she have the goodness to grant me a few moments ’ interview . ”
christie	links	for a moment the girl stood motionless . her left hand was pressed to her side , as though to still the sudden unconquerable agitation of her heart . but she mastered herself , and said in a low voice :
christie	links	“ i will go and see . please come inside. ” she entered a room on the left of the hall , and we heard the low murmur of her voice . and then another voice , much the same in timbre , but with a slightly harder inflection behind its mellow roundness said :
christie	links	“ but certainly . ask them to enter. ” in another minute we were face to face with the mysterious madame daubreuil . she was not nearly so tall as her daughter , and the rounded curves of her figure had all the grace of full maturity . her hair , again unlike her daughter ’ s , was dark , and parted in the middle in the madonna style . her eyes , half hidden by the drooping lids , were blue . there was a dimple in the round chin , and the half parted lips seemed always to hover on the verge of a mysterious smile . there was something almost exaggeratedly feminine about her , at once yielding and seductive . though very well preserved , she was certainly no longer young , but her charm was of the quality which is independent of age .
christie	links	standing there , in her black dress with the fresh white collar and cuffs , her hands clasped together , she looked subtly appealing and helpless . “ you wished to see me , monsieur ? ” she asked .
christie	links	“ yes , madame. ” m. hautet cleared his throat . “ i am investigating the death of m. renauld . you have heard of it , no doubt ? ” she bowed her head without speaking . her expression did not change .
christie	links	“ we came to ask you whether you can—er—throw any light upon the circumstances surrounding it ? ” “ i ? ” the surprise of her tone was excellent . “ yes , madame . it would , perhaps , be better if we could speak to you alone. ” he looked meaningly in the direction of the girl .
christie	links	madame daubreuil turned to her . “ marthe , dear— ” but the girl shook her head . “ no , _maman___ , i will not go . i am not a child . i am twenty-two . i shall not go . ”
christie	links	madame daubreuil turned back to the examining magistrate . “ you see , monsieur. ” “ i should prefer not to speak before mademoiselle daubreuil. ” “ as my daughter says , she is not a child. ” for a moment the magistrate hesitated , baffled .
christie	links	“ very well , madame , ” he said at last . “ have it your own way . we have reason to believe that you were in the habit of visiting the dead man at his villa in the evenings . is that so ? ”
christie	links	the colour rose in the lady ’ s pale cheeks , but she replied quietly : “ i deny your right to ask me such a question ! ” “ madame , we are investigating a murder. ” “ well , what of it ? i had nothing to do with the murder . ”
christie	links	“ madame , we do not say that for a moment . but you knew the dead man well . did he ever confide in you as to any danger that threatened him ? ” “ never . ”
christie	links	“ did he ever mention his life in santiago , and any enemies he may have made there ? ” “ no. ” “ then you can give us no help at all ? ” “ i fear not . i really do not see why you should come to me . can not his wife tell you what you want to know ? ” her voice held a slender inflection of irony .
christie	links	“ madame renauld has told us all she can. ” “ ah ! ” said madame daubreuil . “ i wonder— ” “ you wonder what , madame ? ” “ nothing. ” the examining magistrate looked at her . he was aware that he was fighting a duel , and that he had no mean antagonist .
christie	links	“ you persist in your statement that m. renauld confided nothing in you ? ” “ why should you think it likely that he should confide in me ? ” “ because , madame , ” said m. hautet , with calculated brutality . “ a man tells to his mistress what he does not always tell to his wife . ”
christie	links	“ ah ! ” she sprang forward . her eyes flashed fire . “ monsieur , you insult me ! and before my daughter ! i can tell you nothing . have the goodness to leave my house ! ” the honours undoubtedly rested with the lady . we left the villa marguerite like a shamefaced pack of schoolboys . the magistrate muttered angry ejaculations to himself . poirot seemed lost in thought . suddenly he came out of his reverie with a start , and inquired of m. hautet if there was a good hotel near at hand .
christie	links	“ there is a small place , the hotel des bains , on this side of town . a few hundred yards down the road . it will be handy for your investigations . we shall see you in the morning then , i presume ? ”
christie	links	“ yes , i thank you , m. hautet. ” with mutual civilities , we parted company , poirot and i going towards merlinville , and the others returning to the villa geneviève . “ the french police system is very marvellous , ” said poirot , looking after them . “ the information they possess about every one ’ s life , down to the most commonplace detail , is extraordinary . though he has only been here a little over six weeks , they are perfectly well acquainted with m. renauld ’ s tastes and pursuits , and at a moment ’ s notice they can produce information as to madame daubreuil ’ s banking account , and the sums that have lately been paid in ! undoubtedly the _dossier___ is a great institution . but what is that ? ” he turned sharply .
christie	links	a figure was running hatless , down the road after us . it was marthe daubreuil . “ i beg your pardon , ” she cried breathlessly , as she reached us . “ i—i should not do this , i know . you must not tell my mother . but is it true , what the people say , that m. renauld called in a detective before he died , and—and that you are he ? ”
christie	links	“ yes , mademoiselle , ” said poirot gently . “ it is quite true . but how did you learn it ? ” “ françoise told our amélie , ” explained marthe , with a blush . poirot made a grimace . “ the secrecy , it is impossible in an affair of this kind ! not that it matters . well , mademoiselle , what is it you want to know ? ”
christie	links	the girl hesitated . she seemed longing , yet fearing , to speak . at last , almost in a whisper , she asked : “ is—any one suspected ? ” poirot eyed her keenly . then he replied evasively : “ suspicion is in the air at present , mademoiselle . ”
christie	links	“ yes , i know—but—any one in particular ? ” “ why do you want to know ? ” the girl seemed frightened by the question . all at once poirot ’ s words about her earlier in the day recurred to me . the “ girl with the anxious eyes ! ”
christie	links	“ m . renauld was always very kind to me , ” she replied at last . “ it is natural that i should be interested. ” “ i see , ” said poirot . “ well , mademoiselle , suspicion at present is hovering round two persons . ”
christie	links	“ two ? ” i could have sworn there was a note of surprise and relief in her voice . “ their names are unknown , but they are presumed to be chilians from santiago . and now , mademoiselle , you see what comes of being young and beautiful ! i have betrayed professional secrets for you ! ”
christie	links	the girl laughed merrily , and then , rather shyly , she thanked him . “ i must run back now . _maman___ will miss me. ” and she turned and ran back up the road , looking like a modern atalanta . i stared after her .
christie	links	“ _mon ami___ , ” said poirot , in his gentle ironical voice , “ is it that we are to remain planted here all night—just because you have seen a beautiful young woman , and your head is in a whirl ? ”
christie	links	i laughed and apologized . “ but she _is___ beautiful , poirot . any one might be excused for being bowled over by her. ” poirot groaned . “ _mon dieu ! ___ but it is that you have the susceptible heart ! ”
christie	links	“ poirot , ” i said , “ do you remember after the styles case when— ” “ when you were in love with two charming women at once , and neither of them were for you ? yes , i remember . ”
christie	links	“ you consoled me by saying that perhaps some day we should hunt together again , and that then— ” “ _eh bien ? ___ ” “ well , we are hunting together again , and— ” i paused , and laughed rather self-consciously .
christie	links	but to my surprise poirot shook his head very earnestly . “ ah , _mon ami___ , do not set your heart on marthe daubreuil . she is not for you , that one ! take it from papa poirot ! ”
christie	links	“ why , ” i cried , “ the commissary assured me that she was as good as she is beautiful ! a perfect angel ! ” “ some of the greatest criminals i have known had the faces of angels , ” remarked poirot cheerfully . “ a malformation of the grey cells may coincide quite easily with the face of a madonna . ”
christie	links	“ poirot , ” i cried , horrified , “ you can not mean that you suspect an innocent child like this ! ” “ ta-ta-ta ! do not excite yourself ! i have not said that i suspected her . but you must admit that her anxiety to know about the case is somewhat unusual . ”
christie	links	“ for once , i see further than you do , ” i said . “ her anxiety is not for herself—but for her mother. ” “ my friend , ” said poirot , “ as usual , you see nothing at all . madame daubreuil is very well able to look after herself without her daughter worrying about her . i admit i was teasing you just now , but all the same i repeat what i said before . do not set your heart on that girl . she is not for you ! i , hercule poirot , know it . _sacré ! ___ if only i could remember where i had seen that face ! ”
christie	links	“ what face ? ” i asked , surprised . “ the daughter ’ s ? ” “ no . the mother ’ s. ” noting my surprise , he nodded emphatically . “ but yes—it is as i tell you . it was a long time ago , when i was still with the police in belgium . i have never actually seen the woman before , but i have seen her picture—and in connection with some case . i rather fancy— ”
christie	links	“ yes ? ” “ i may be mistaken , but i rather fancy that it was a murder case ! ” 8 an unexpected meeting we were up at the villa betimes next morning . the man on guard at the gate did not bar our way this time . instead , he respectfully saluted us , and we passed on to the house . the maid léonie was just coming down the stairs , and seemed not averse to the prospect of a little conversation .
christie	links	poirot inquired after the health of mrs. renauld . léonie shook her head . “ she is terribly upset , _la pauvre dame ! ___ she will eat nothing—but nothing ! and she is as pale as a ghost . it is heartrending to see her . ah , _par exemple___ , it is not i who would grieve like that for a man who had deceived me with another woman ! ”
christie	links	poirot nodded sympathetically . “ what you say is very just , but what will you ? the heart of a woman who loves will forgive many blows . still , undoubtedly there must have been many scenes of recrimination between them in the last few months ? ”
christie	links	again léonie shook her head . “ never , monsieur . never have i heard madame utter a word of protest—of reproach , even ! she had the temper and disposition of an angel—quite different to monsieur . ”
christie	links	“ monsieur renauld had not the temper of an angel ? ” “ far from it . when he enraged himself , the whole house knew of it . the day that he quarrelled with m. jack—_ma foi ! ___ they might have been heard in the market place , they shouted so loud ! ”
christie	links	“ indeed , ” said poirot . “ and when did this quarrel take place ? ” “ oh ! it was just before m. jack went to paris . almost he missed his train . he came out of the library , and caught up his bag which he had left in the hall . the automobile , it was being repaired , and he had to run for the station . i was dusting the salon , and i saw him pass , and his face was white—white—with two burning spots of red . ah , but he was angry ! ”
christie	links	léonie was enjoying her narrative thoroughly . “ and the dispute , what was it about ? ” “ ah , that i do not know , ” confessed léonie . “ it is true that they shouted , but their voices were so loud and high , and they spoke so fast , that only one well acquainted with english could have comprehended . but monsieur , he was like a thundercloud all day ! impossible to please him ! ”
christie	links	the sound of a door shutting upstairs cut short léonie ’ s loquacity . “ and françoise who awaits me ! ” she exclaimed , awakening to a tardy remembrance of her duties . “ that old one , she always scolds . ”
christie	links	“ one moment , mademoiselle . the examining magistrate , where is he ? ” “ they have gone out to look at the automobile in the garage . monsieur the commissary had some idea that it might have been used on the night of the murder . ”
christie	links	“ _quelle idée___ , ” murmured poirot , as the girl disappeared . “ you will go out and join them ? ” “ no , i shall await their return in the _salon___ . it is cool there on this hot morning . ”
christie	links	this placid way of taking things did not quite commend itself to me . “ if you don ’ t mind— ” i said , and hesitated . “ not in the least . you wish to investigate on your own account , eh ? ”
christie	links	“ well , i ’ d rather like to have a look at giraud , if he ’ s anywhere about , and see what he ’ s up to. ” “ the human foxhound , ” murmured poirot , as he leaned back in a comfortable chair , and closed his eyes . “ by all means , my friend . au revoir . ”
christie	links	i strolled out of the front door . it was certainly hot . i turned up the path we had taken the day before . i had a mind to study the scene of the crime myself . i did not go directly to the spot , however , but turned aside into the bushes , so as to come out on the links some hundred yards or so further to the right . if giraud were still on the spot , i wanted to observe his methods before he knew of my presence . but the shrubbery here was much denser , and i had quite a struggle to force my way through . when i emerged at last on the course , it was quite unexpectedly and with such vigour that i cannoned heavily into a young lady who had been standing with her back to the plantation .
christie	links	she not unnaturally gave a suppressed shriek , but i , too , uttered an exclamation of surprise . for it was my friend of the train , cinderella ! the surprise was mutual . “ you , ” we both exclaimed simultaneously .
christie	links	the young lady recovered herself first . “ my only aunt ! ” she exclaimed . “ what are you doing here ? ” “ for the matter of that , what are you ? ” i retorted . “ when last i saw you , the day before yesterday , you were trotting home to england like a good little boy . have they given you a season ticket to and fro , on the strength of your m.p . ? ”
christie	links	i ignored the end of the speech . “ when last i saw you , ” i said , “ you were trotting home with your sister , like a good little girl . by the way , how is your sister ? ”
christie	links	a flash of white teeth rewarded me . “ how kind of you to ask ! my sister is well , i thank you. ” “ she is here with you ? ” “ she remained in town , ” said the minx with dignity .
christie	links	“ i don ’ t believe you ’ ve got a sister , ” i laughed . “ if you have , her name is harris ! ” “ do you remember mine ? ” she asked , with a smile . “ cinderella . but you ’ re going to tell me the real one now , aren ’ t you ? ”
christie	links	she shook her head with a wicked look . “ not even why you ’ re here ? ” “ oh , that ! i suppose you ’ ve heard of members of my profession ‘ resting. ’ ” “ at expensive french watering-places ? ” “ dirt cheap if you know where to go . ”
christie	links	i eyed her keenly . “ still , you ’ d no intention of coming here when i met you two days ago ? ” “ we all have our disappointments , ” said miss cinderella sententiously . “ there now , i ’ ve told you quite as much as is good for you . little boys should not be inquisitive . you ’ ve not yet told me what you ’ re doing here ? got the m.p . in tow , i suppose , doing the gay boy on the beach . ”
christie	links	i shook my head . “ guess again . you remember my telling you that my great friend was a detective ? ” “ yes ? ” “ and perhaps you ’ ve heard about this crime—at the villa geneviève— ? ” she stared at me . her breast heaved , and her eyes grew wide and round .
christie	links	“ you don ’ t mean—that you ’ re in on _that ? ___ ” i nodded . there was no doubt that i had scored heavily . her emotion , as she regarded me , was only too evident . for some few seconds , she remained silent , staring at me . then she nodded her head emphatically .
christie	links	“ well , if that doesn ’ t beat the band ! tote me round . i want to see all the horrors. ” “ what do you mean ? ” “ what i say . bless the boy , didn ’ t i tell you i doted on crimes ? what do you think i ’ m imperilling my ankles for in high-heeled shoes over this stubble ? i ’ ve been nosing round for hours . tried the front way in , but that old stick-in-the-mud of a french gendarme wasn ’ t taking any . i guess helen of troy , and cleopatra , and mary , queen of scots , rolled in one wouldn ’ t cut ice with him ! it ’ s a real piece of luck happening on you this way . come on , show me all the sights . ”
christie	links	“ but look here—wait a minute—i can ’ t . nobody ’ s allowed in . they ’ re awfully strict. ” “ aren ’ t you and your friend the big bugs ? ” i was loath to relinquish my position of importance . “ why are you so keen ? ” i asked weakly . “ and what is it you want to see . ”
christie	links	“ oh , everything ! the place where it happened , and the weapon , and the body , and any finger-prints or interesting things like that . i ’ ve never had a chance of being right in on a murder like this before . it ’ ll last me all my life ? ”
christie	links	i turned away , sickened . what were women coming to nowadays ? the girl ’ s ghoulish excitement nauseated me . i had read of the mobs of women who besieged the law courts when some wretched man was being tried for his life on the capital charge . i had sometimes wondered who these women were . now i knew . they were of the likeness of cinderella , young , yet obsessed with a yearning for morbid excitement , for sensation at any price , without regard to any decency or good feeling . the vividness of the girl ’ s beauty had attracted me in spite of myself , yet at heart i retained my first impression of disapproval and dislike . i thought of my mother , long since dead . what would she have said of this strange modern product of girlhood ? the pretty face with the paint and powder , and the ghoulish mind behind !
christie	links	“ come off your high horse , ” said the lady suddenly . “ and don ’ t give yourself airs . when you got called to this job , did you put your nose in the air and say it was a nasty business , and you wouldn ’ t be mixed up in it ? ”
christie	links	“ no , but— ” “ if you ’ d been here on a holiday , wouldn ’ t you be nosing round just the same as i am ? of course you would. ” “ i ’ m a man . you ’ re a woman . ”
christie	links	“ your idea of a woman is some one who gets on a chair and shrieks if she sees a mouse . that ’ s all prehistoric . but you _will___ show me round , won ’ t you ? you see , it might make a big difference to me . ”
christie	links	“ in what way ? ” “ they ’ re keeping all the reporters out . i might make a big scoop with one of the papers . you don ’ t know how much they pay for a bit of inside stuff . ”
christie	links	i hesitated . she slipped a small soft hand into mine . “ _please___—there ’ s a dear. ” i capitulated . secretly , i knew that i should rather enjoy the part of showman . after all , the moral attitude displayed by the girl was none of my business . i was a little nervous as to what the examining magistrate might say , but i reassured myself by the reflection that no harm could possibly be done .
christie	links	we repaired first to the spot where the body had been discovered . a man was on guard there , who saluted respectfully , knowing me by sight , and raised no question as to my companion . presumably he regarded her as vouched for by me . i explained to cinderella just how the discovery had been made , and she listened attentively , sometimes putting an intelligent question . then we turned our steps in the direction of the villa . i proceeded rather cautiously , for , truth to tell , i was not at all anxious to meet any one . i took the girl through the shrubbery round to the back of the house where the small shed was . i recollected that yesterday evening , after relocking the door , m. bex had left the key with the _sergent de ville___ marchaud , “ in case m. giraud should require it while we are upstairs. ” i thought it quite likely that the sûreté detective , after using it , had returned it to marchaud again . leaving the girl out of sight in the shrubbery , i entered the house . marchaud was on duty outside the door of the _salon___ . from within came the murmur of voices .
christie	links	“ monsieur desires hautet ? he is within . he is again interrogating françoise. ” “ no , ” i said hastily , “ i don ’ t want him . but i should very much like the key of the shed outside if it is not against regulations . ”
christie	links	“ but certainly , monsieur. ” he produced it . “ here it is . m. le juge gave orders that all facilities were to be placed at your disposal . you will return it to me when you have finished out there , that is all . ”
christie	links	“ of course. ” i felt a thrill of satisfaction as i realized that in marchaud ’ s eyes , at least , i ranked equally in importance with poirot . the girl was waiting for me . she gave an exclamation of delight as she saw the key in my hand .
christie	links	“ you ’ ve got it then ? ” “ of course , ” i said coolly . “ all the same , you know , what i ’ m doing is highly irregular. ” “ you ’ ve been a perfect duck , and i shan ’ t forget it . come along . they can ’ t see us from the house , can they ? ”
christie	links	“ wait a minute. ” i arrested her eager advance . “ i won ’ t stop you if you really wish to go in . but do you ? you ’ ve seen the grave , and the grounds , and you ’ ve heard all the details of the affair . isn ’ t that enough for you ? this is going to be gruesome , you know , and—unpleasant . ”
christie	links	she looked at me for a moment with an expression that i could not quite fathom . then she laughed . “ me for the horrors , ” she said . “ come along. ” in silence we arrived at the door of the shed . i opened it and we passed in . i walked over to the body , and gently pulled down the sheet as m. bex had done the preceding afternoon . a little gasping sound escaped from the girl ’ s lips , and i turned and looked at her . there was horror on her face now , and those debonair high spirits of hers were quenched utterly . she had not chosen to listen to my advice , and she was punished now for her disregard of it . i felt singularly merciless towards her . she should go through with it now . i turned the corpse gently over .
christie	links	“ you see , ” i said , “ he was stabbed in the back. ” her voice was almost soundless . “ with what ? ” i nodded towards the glass jar . “ that dagger. ” suddenly the girl reeled , and then sank down in a heap . i sprang to her assistance .
christie	links	“ you are faint . come out of here . it has been too much for you. ” “ water , ” she murmured . “ quick . water.… ” i left her , and rushed into the house . fortunately none of the servants were about , and i was able to secure a glass of water unobserved and add a few drops of brandy from a pocket flask . in a few minutes i was back again . the girl was lying as i had left her , but a few sips of the brandy and water revived her in a marvellous manner .
christie	links	“ take me out of here—oh , quickly , quickly ! ” she cried , shuddering . supporting her with my arm i led her out into the air , and she pulled the door to behind her . then she drew a deep breath .
christie	links	“ that ’ s better . oh , it was horrible ! why did you ever let me go in ? ” i felt this to be so feminine that i could not forbear a smile . secretly , i was not dissatisfied with her collapse . it proved that she was not quite so callous as i had thought her . after all she was little more than a child , and her curiosity had probably been of the unthinking order .
christie	links	“ i did my best to stop you , you know , ” i said gently . “ i suppose you did . well , good-bye. ” “ look here , you can ’ t start off like that—all alone . you ’ re not fit for it . i insist on accompanying you back to merlinville . ”
christie	links	“ nonsense . i ’ m quite all right now. ” “ supposing you felt faint again ? no , i shall come with you. ” but this she combated with a good deal of energy . in the end , however , i prevailed so far as to be allowed to accompany her to the outskirts of the town . we retraced our steps over our former route , passing the grave again , and making a detour on to the road . where the first straggling line of shops began , she stopped and held out her hand .
christie	links	“ good-bye , and thank you ever so much for coming with me. ” “ are you sure you ’ re all right now ? ” “ quite , thanks . i hope you won ’ t get into any trouble over showing me things ? ”
christie	links	i disclaimed the idea lightly . “ well , good-bye. ” “ au revoir , ” i corrected . “ if you ’ re staying here , we shall meet again. ” she flashed a smile at me . “ that ’ s so . au revoir , then . ”
christie	links	“ wait a second , you haven ’ t told me your address ? ” “ oh , i ’ m staying at the hôtel du phare . it ’ s a little place , but quite good . come and look me up tomorrow . ”
christie	links	“ i will , ” i said , with perhaps rather unnecessary _empressement___ . i watched her out of sight , then turned and retraced my steps to the villa . i remembered that i had not relocked the door of the shed . fortunately no one had noticed the oversight , and turning the key i removed it and returned it to the _sergent de ville___ . and , as i did so , it came upon me suddenly that though cinderella had given me her address i still did not know her name .
christie	links	9 m. giraud finds some clues in the _salon___ i found the examining magistrate busily interrogating the old gardener auguste . poirot and the commissary , who were both present , greeted me respectively with a smile and a polite bow . i slipped quietly into a seat . m. hautet was painstaking and meticulous in the extreme , but did not succeed in eliciting anything of importance .
christie	links	the gardening gloves auguste admitted to be his . he wore them when handling a certain species of primula plant which was poisonous to some people . he could not say when he had worn them last . certainly he had not missed them . where were they kept ? sometimes in one place , sometimes in another . the spade was usually to be found in the small tool shed . was it locked ? of course it was locked . where was the key kept ? _parbleu___ , it was in the door of course ! there was nothing of value to steal . who would have expected a party of bandits , of assassins ? such things did not happen in madame la vicomtesse ’ s time . m. hautet signifying that he had finished with him , the old man withdrew , grumbling to the last . remembering poirot ’ s unaccountable insistence on the footprints in the flower beds , i scrutinized him narrowly as he gave his evidence . either he had nothing to do with the crime or he was a consummate actor . suddenly , just as he was going out of the door , an idea struck me . “ _pardon___ m. hautet , ” i cried , “ but will you permit me to ask him one question ? ”
christie	links	“ but certainly , monsieur. ” thus encouraged , i turned to auguste . “ where do you keep your boots ? ” “ _sac à papier ! ___ ” growled the old man . “ on my feet . where else ? ” “ but when you go to bed at night ? ”
christie	links	“ under my bed. ” “ but who cleans them ? ” “ nobody . why should they be cleaned ? is it that i promenade myself on the front like a young man ? on sunday i wear the sunday boots , _bien entendu___ , but otherwise— ! ” he shrugged his shoulders .
christie	links	i shook my head , discouraged . “ well , well , ” said the magistrate . “ we do not advance very much . undoubtedly we are held up until we get the return cable from santiago . has any one seen giraud ? in verity that one lacks politeness ! i have a very good mind to send for him and— ”
christie	links	“ you will not have to send far , m. le juge. ” the quiet voice startled us . giraud was standing outside looking in through the open window . he leaped lightly into the room , and advanced to the table .
christie	links	“ here i am , m. le juge , at your service . accept my excuses for not presenting myself sooner. ” “ not at all . not at all , ” said the magistrate , rather confused . “ of course i am only a detective , ” continued the other . “ i know nothing of interrogatories . were i conducting one , i should be inclined to do so without an open window . any one standing outside can so easily hear all that passes.… but no matter . ”
christie	links	m. hautet flushed angrily . there was evidently going to be no love lost between the examining magistrate and the detective in charge of the case . they had fallen foul of each other at the start . perhaps in any event it would have been much the same . to giraud , all examining magistrates were fools , and to m. hautet who took himself seriously , the casual manner of the paris detective could not fail to give offence .
christie	links	“ _eh bien___ , m. giraud , ” said the magistrate rather sharply . “ without doubt you have been employing your time to a marvel ? you have the names of the assassins for us , have you not ? and also the precise spot where they find themselves now ? ”
christie	links	unmoved by this irony , giraud replied : “ i know at least where they have come from. ” “ _comment ? ___ ” giraud took two small objects from his pocket and laid them down on the table . we crowded round . the objects were very simple ones : the stub of a cigarette , and an unlighted match . the detective wheeled round on poirot .
christie	links	“ what do you see there ? ” he asked . there was something almost brutal in his tone . it made my cheeks flush . but poirot remained unmoved . he shrugged his shoulders . “ a cigarette end , and a match . ”
christie	links	“ and what does that tell you ? ” poirot spread out his hands . “ it tells me—nothing. ” “ ah ! ” said giraud , in a satisfied voice . “ you haven ’ t made a study of these things . that ’ s not an ordinary match—not in this country at least . it ’ s common enough in south america . luckily it ’ s unlighted . i mightn ’ t have recognized it otherwise . evidently one of the men threw away his cigarette end , and lit another , spilling one match out of the box as he did so . ”
christie	links	“ and the other match ? ” asked poirot . “ which match ? ” “ the one he _did___ light his cigarette with . you have found that also ? ” “ no. ” “ perhaps you didn ’ t search very thoroughly. ” “ not search thoroughly— ” for a moment it seemed as though the detective were going to break out angrily , but with an effort he controlled himself . “ i see you love a joke , m. poirot . but in any case , match or no match , the cigarette end would be sufficient . it is a south american cigarette with liquorice pectoral paper . ”
christie	links	poirot bowed . the commissary spoke : “ the cigarette end and match might have belonged to m. renauld . remember , it is only two years since he returned from south america. ” “ no , ” replied the other confidently . “ i have already searched among the effects of m. renauld . the cigarettes he smoked and the matches he used are quite different . ”
christie	links	“ you do not think it odd , ” asked poirot , “ that these strangers should come unprovided with a weapon , with gloves , with a spade , and that they should so conveniently find all these things ? ”
christie	links	giraud smiled in a rather superior manner . “ undoubtedly it is strange . indeed , without the theory that i hold , it would be inexplicable. ” “ aha ! ” said m. hautet . “ an accomplice . an accomplice within the house ! ”
christie	links	“ or outside it , ” said giraud with a peculiar smile . “ but some one must have admitted them ? we can not allow that , by an unparalleled piece of good fortune , they found the door ajar for them to walk in ? ”
christie	links	“ _d ’ accord___ , m. le juge . the door was opened for them , but it could just as easily be opened from outside—by some one who possessed a key. ” “ but who did possess a key ? ”
christie	links	giraud shrugged his shoulders . “ as for that , no one who possesses one is going to admit the fact if they can help it . but several people _might___ have had one . m. jack renauld , the son , for instance . it is true that he is on his way to south america , but he might have lost the key or had it stolen from him . then there is the gardener—he has been here many years . one of the younger servants may have a lover . it is easy to take an impression of a key and have one cut . there are many possibilities . then there is another person who , i should judge , is exceedingly likely to have such a thing in her keeping . ”
christie	links	“ who is that ? ” “ madame daubreuil , ” said the detective dryly . “ eh , eh ! ” said the magistrate , his face falling a little , “ so you have heard about that , have you ? ” “ i hear everything , ” said giraud imperturbably .
christie	links	“ there is one thing i could swear you have not heard , ” said m. hautet , delighted to be able to show superior knowledge , and without more ado , he retailed the story of the mysterious visitor the night before . he also touched on the cheque made out to “ duveen , ” and finally handed giraud the letter signed “ bella . ”
christie	links	giraud listened in silence , studied the letter attentively , and then handed it back . “ all very interesting , m. le juge . but my theory remains unaffected. ” “ and your theory is ? ” “ for the moment i prefer not to say . remember , i am only just beginning my investigations . ”
christie	links	“ tell me one thing , m. giraud , ” said poirot suddenly . “ your theory allows for the door being opened . it does not explain why it was _left___ open . when they departed , would it not have been natural for them to close it behind them . if a _sergent de ville___ had chanced to come up to the house , as is sometimes done to see that all is well , they might have been discovered and overtaken almost at once . ”
christie	links	“ bah ! they forgot it . a mistake , i grant you. ” then , to my surprise , poirot uttered almost the same words as he had uttered to bex the previous evening : “ _i do not agree with you.___ the door being left open was the result of either design or necessity , and any theory that does not admit that fact is bound to prove vain . ”
christie	links	we all regarded the little man with a good deal of astonishment . the confession of ignorance drawn from him over the match end had , i thought , been bound to humiliate him , but here he was self satisfied as ever , laying down the law to the great giraud without a tremor .
christie	links	the detective twisted his moustache , eyeing my friend in a somewhat bantering fashion . “ you don ’ t agree with me , eh ? well , what strikes you particularly about the case . let ’ s hear your views . ”
christie	links	“ one thing presents itself to me as being significant . tell me , m. giraud , does nothing strike you as familiar about this case ? is there nothing it reminds you of ? ” “ familiar ? reminds me of ? i can ’ t say off-hand . i don ’ t think so , though . ”
christie	links	“ you are wrong , ” said poirot quietly . “ a crime almost precisely similar has been committed before. ” “ when ? and where ? ” “ ah , that , unfortunately , i can not for the moment remember—but i shall do so . i had hoped you might be able to assist me . ”
christie	links	giraud snorted incredulously . “ there have been many affairs of masked men ! i can not remember the details of them all . these crimes all resemble each other more or less. ” “ there is such a thing as the individual touch. ” poirot suddenly assumed his lecturing manner , and addressed us collectively . “ i am speaking to you now of the psychology of crime . m. giraud knows quite well that each criminal has his particular method , and that the police , when called in to investigate—say a case of burglary—can often make a shrewd guess at the offender , simply by the peculiar method he has employed . ( japp would tell you the same , hastings . ) man is an unoriginal animal . unoriginal within the law in his daily respectable life , equally unoriginal outside the law . if a man commits a crime , any other crime he commits will resemble it closely . the english murderer who disposed of his wives in succession by drowning them in their baths was a case in point . had he varied his methods , he might have escaped detection to this day . but he obeyed the common dictates of human nature , arguing that what had once succeeded would succeed again , and he paid the penalty of his lack of originality . ”
christie	links	“ and the point of all this ? ” sneered giraud . “ that when you have two crimes precisely similar in design and execution , you find the same brain behind them both . i am looking for that brain , m. giraud—and i shall find it . here we have a true clue—a psychological clue . you may know all about cigarettes and match ends , m. giraud , but i , hercule poirot , know the mind of man ! ” and the ridiculous little fellow tapped his forehead with emphasis .
christie	links	giraud remained singularly unimpressed . “ for your guidance , ” continued poirot , “ i will also advise you of one fact which might fail to be brought to your notice . the wrist watch of madame renauld , on the day following the tragedy , had gained two hours . it might interest you to examine it . ”
christie	links	giraud stared . “ perhaps it was in the habit of gaining ? ” “ as a matter of fact , i am told it did. ” “ _eh bien___ , then ! ” “ all the same , two hours is a good deal , ” said poirot softly . “ then there is the matter of the footprints in the flower-bed . ”
christie	links	he nodded his head towards the open window . giraud took two eager strides , and looked out . “ this bed here ? ” “ yes. ” “ but i see no footprints ? ” “ no , ” said poirot , straightening a little pile of books on a table . “ there are none . ”
christie	links	for a moment an almost murderous rage obscured giraud ’ s face . he took two strides towards his tormentor , but at that moment the _salon___ door was opened , and marchaud announced . “ m . stonor , the secretary , has just arrived from england . may he enter ? ”
christie	links	10 gabriel stonor the man who entered the room was a striking figure . very tall , with a well knit athletic frame , and a deeply bronzed face and neck , he dominated the assembly . even giraud seemed anaemic beside him . when i knew him better i realized that gabriel stonor was quite an unusual personality . english by birth , he had knocked about all over the world . he had shot big game in africa , travelled in korea , ranched in california , and traded in the south sea islands . he had been secretary to a new york railway magnate , and had spent a year encamped in the desert with a friendly tribe of arabs .
christie	links	his unerring eye picked out m. hautet . “ the examining magistrate in charge of the case ? pleased to meet you , m. le juge . this is a terrible business . how ’ s mrs. renauld ? is she bearing up fairly well ? it must have been an awful shock to her . ”
christie	links	“ terrible , terrible , ” said m. hautet . “ permit me to introduce m. bex—our commissary of police , m. giraud of the sûreté . this gentleman is m. hercule poirot . m. renauld sent for him , but he arrived too late to do anything to avert the tragedy . a friend of m. poirot ’ s , captain hastings . ”
christie	links	stonor looked at poirot with some interest . “ sent for you , did he ? ” “ you did not know , then , that m. renauld contemplated calling in a detective ? ” interposed m. bex . “ no , i didn ’ t . but it doesn ’ t surprise me a bit . ”
christie	links	“ why ? ” “ because the old man was rattled ! i don ’ t know what it was all about . he didn ’ t confide in me . we weren ’ t on those terms . but rattled he was—and badly ! ”
christie	links	“ h ’ m ! ” said m. hautet . “ but you have no notion of the cause ? ” “ that ’ s what i said , sir. ” “ you will pardon me , m. stonor , but we must begin with a few formalities . your name ? ”
christie	links	“ gabriel stonor. ” “ how long ago was it that you became secretary to m. renauld ? ” “ about two years ago , when he first arrived from south america . i met him through a mutual friend , and he offered me the post . a thundering good boss he was too . ”
christie	links	“ did he talk to you much about his life in south america ? ” “ yes , a good bit. ” “ do you know if he was ever in santiago ? ” “ several times , i believe. ” “ he never mentioned any special incident that occurred there—anything that might have provoked some vendetta against him ? ”
christie	links	“ never. ” “ did he speak of any secret that he had acquired whilst sojourning there ? ” “ no. ” “ did he ever say anything at all about a secret ? ” “ not that i can remember . but , for all that , there _was___ a mystery about him . i ’ ve never heard him speak of his boyhood for instance , or of any incident prior to his arrival in south america . he was a french canadian by birth , i believe , but i ’ ve never heard him speak of his life in canada . he could shut up like a clam if he liked . ”
christie	links	“ so , as far as you know , he had no enemies , and you can give us no clue as to any secret to obtain possession of which he might have been murdered ? ”
christie	links	“ that ’ s so. ” “ m . stonor , have you ever heard the name of duveen in connection with m. renauld ? ” “ duveen . duveen. ” he tried the name over thoughtfully . “ i don ’ t think i have . and yet it seems familiar . ”
christie	links	“ do you know a lady , a friend of m. renauld ’ s whose christian name is bella ? ” again mr. stonor shook his head . “ bella duveen ? is that the full name ? it ’ s curious ! i ’ m sure i know it . but for the moment i can ’ t remember in what connection . ”
christie	links	the magistrate coughed . “ you understand , m. stonor—the case is like this . _there must be no reservations.___ you might , perhaps , through a feeling of consideration for madame renauld—for whom , i gather , you have a great esteem and affection , you might—_enfin ! ___ ” said m. hautet getting rather tied up in his sentence , “ there must absolutely be no reservations . ”
christie	links	stonor stared at him , a dawning light of comprehension in his eyes . “ i don ’ t quite get you , ” he said gently . “ where does mrs. renauld come in ? i ’ ve an immense respect and affection for that lady ; she ’ s a very wonderful and unusual type , but i don ’ t quite see how my reservations , or otherwise , could affect her ? ”
christie	links	“ not if this bella duveen should prove to have been something more than a friend to her husband ? ” “ ah ! ” said stonor . “ i get you now . but i ’ ll bet my bottom dollar that you ’ re wrong . the old man never so much as looked at a petticoat . he just adored his own wife . they were the most devoted couple i know . ”
christie	links	m. hautet shook his head gently . “ m . stonor , we hold absolute proof—a love letter written by this bella to m. renauld , accusing him of having tired of her . moreover , we have further proof that , at the time of his death , he was carrying on an intrigue with a frenchwoman , a madame daubreuil , who rents the adjoining villa . and this is the man who , according to you , never looked at a petticoat ! ”
christie	links	the secretary ’ s eyes narrowed . “ hold on , m. le juge . you ’ re barking up the wrong tree . i knew paul renauld . what you ’ ve just been saying is utterly impossible . there ’ s some other explanation . ”
christie	links	the magistrate shrugged his shoulders . “ what other explanation could there be ? ” “ what leads you to think it was a love affair ? ” “ madame daubreuil was in the habit of visiting him here in the evenings . also , since m. renauld came to the villa geneviève , madame daubreuil has paid large sums of money into the bank in notes . in all , the amount totals four thousand pounds of your english money . ”
christie	links	“ i guess that ’ s right , ” said stonor quietly . “ i transmitted him those sums at his request . but it wasn ’ t an intrigue. ” “ eh ! _mon dieu ! ___ what else could it be ? ” “ _blackmail___ , ” said stonor sharply , bringing down his hand with a slam on the table . “ that ’ s what it was . ”
christie	links	“ ah ! voilà une idée ! ” cried the magistrate , shaken in spite of himself . “ blackmail , ” repeated stonor . “ the old man was being bled—and at a good rate too . four thousand in a couple of months . whew ! i told you just now there was a mystery about renauld . evidently this madame daubreuil knew enough of it to put the screws on . ”
christie	links	“ it is possible , ” the commissary cried excitedly . “ decidedly , it is possible. ” “ possible ? ” roared stonor . “ it ’ s certain ! tell me , have you asked mrs. renauld about this love affair stunt of yours ? ”
christie	links	“ no , monsieur . we did not wish to occasion her any distress if it could reasonably be avoided. ” “ distress ? why , she ’ d laugh in your face . i tell you , she and renauld were a couple in a hundred . ”
christie	links	“ ah , that reminds me of another point , ” said m. hautet . “ did m. renauld take you into his confidence at all as to the dispositions of his will ? ” “ i know all about it—took it to the lawyer for him after he ’ d drawn it out . i can give you the name of his solicitors if you want to see it . they ’ ve got it there . quite simple . half in trust to his wife for her lifetime , the other half to his son . a few legacies . i rather think he left me a thousand . ”
christie	links	“ when was this will drawn up ? ” “ oh , about a year and a half ago. ” “ would it surprise you very much , m. stonor , to hear that m. renauld had made another will , less than a fortnight ago ? ”
christie	links	stonor was obviously very much surprised . “ i ’ d no idea of it . what ’ s it like ? ” “ the whole of his vast fortune is left unreservedly to his wife . there is no mention of his son . ”
christie	links	mr. stonor gave vent to a prolonged whistle . “ i call that rather rough on the lad . his mother adores him , of course , but to the world at large it looks rather like a want of confidence on his father ’ s part . it will be rather galling to his pride . still , it all goes to prove what i told you , that renauld and his wife were on first rate terms . ”
christie	links	“ quite so , quite so , ” said m. hautet . “ it is possible we shall have to revise our ideas on several points . we have , of course , cabled to santiago , and are expecting a reply from there any minute . in all possibility , everything will then be perfectly clear and straightforward . on the other hand , if your suggestion of blackmail is true , madame daubreuil ought to be able to give us valuable information . ”
christie	links	poirot interjected a remark : “ m . stonor , the english chauffeur , masters , had he been long with m. renauld ? ” “ over a year ? ” “ have you any idea whether he has ever been in south america ? ”
christie	links	“ i ’ m quite sure he hasn ’ t . before coming to mr. renauld , he had been for many years with some people in gloucestershire whom i know well. ” “ in fact , you can answer for him as being above suspicion ? ”
christie	links	“ absolutely. ” poirot seemed somewhat crest-fallen . meanwhile the magistrate had summoned marchaud . “ my compliments to madame renauld , and i should be glad to speak to her for a few minutes . beg her not to disturb herself . i will wait upon her upstairs . ”
christie	links	marchaud saluted and disappeared . we waited some minutes , and then , to our surprise , the door opened , and mrs. renauld , deathly pale in her heavy mourning , entered the room . m. hautet brought forward a chair , uttering vigorous protestations , and she thanked him with a smile . stonor was holding one hand of hers in his with an eloquent sympathy . words evidently failed him . mrs. renauld turned to m. hautet .
christie	links	“ you wished to ask me something , m. le juge. ” “ with your permission , madame . i understand your husband was a french canadian by birth . can you tell me anything of his youth , or upbringing ? ”
christie	links	she shook her head . “ my husband was always very reticent about himself , monsieur . he came from the north west , i know , but i fancy that he had an unhappy childhood , for he never cared to speak of that time . our life was lived entirely in the present and the future . ”
christie	links	“ was there any mystery in his past life ? ” mrs. renauld smiled a little , and shook her head . “ nothing so romantic , i am sure , m. le juge. ” m. hautet also smiled .
christie	links	“ true , we must not permit ourselves to get melodramatic . there is one thing more— ” he hesitated . stonor broke in impetuously : “ they ’ ve got an extraordinary idea into their heads mrs. renauld . they actually fancy that mr. renauld was carrying on an intrigue with a madame daubreuil who , it seems , lives next door . ”
christie	links	the scarlet colour flamed into mrs. renauld ’ s cheeks . she flung her head up , then bit her lip , her face quivering . stonor stood looking at her in astonishment , but m. bex leaned forward and said gently : “ we regret to cause you pain , madame , but have you any reason to believe that madame daubreuil was your husband ’ s mistress ? ”
christie	links	with a sob of anguish , mrs. renauld buried her face in her hands . her shoulders heaved convulsively . at last she lifted her head , and said brokenly : “ she may have been . ”
christie	links	never , in all my life , have i seen anything to equal the blank amazement on stonor ’ s face . he was thoroughly taken aback . 11 jack renauld what the next development of the conversation would have been , i can not say , for at that moment the door was thrown violently open , and a tall young man strode into the room .
christie	links	just for a moment i had the uncanny sensation that the dead man had come to life again . then i realized that this dark head was untouched with grey , and that , in point of fact , it was a mere boy who now burst in among us with so little ceremony . he went straight to mrs. renauld with an impetuosity that took no heed of the presence of others .
christie	links	“ mother ! ” “ jack ! ” with a cry she folded him in her arms . “ my dearest ! but what brings you here ? you were to sail on the _anzora___ from cherbourg two days ago ? ” then , suddenly recalling to herself the presence of others , she turned with a certain dignity , “ my son , messieurs . ”
christie	links	“ aha ! ” said m. hautet , acknowledging the young man ’ s bow . “ so you did not sail on the _anzora ? ___ ” “ no , monsieur . as i was about to explain , the _anzora___ was detained twenty-four hours through engine trouble . i should have sailed last night instead of the night before , but , happening to buy an evening paper , i saw in it an account of the—the awful tragedy that had befallen us— ” his voice broke and the tears came into his eyes . “ my poor father—my poor , poor , father . ”
christie	links	staring at him like one in a dream , mrs. renauld repeated : “ so you did not sail ? ” and then , with a gesture of infinite weariness , she murmured as though to herself , “ after all , it does not matter—now . ”
christie	links	“ sit down , m. renauld , i beg of you , ” said m. hautet , indicating a chair . “ my sympathy for you is profound . it must have been a terrible shock to you to learn the news as you did . however , it is most fortunate that you were prevented from sailing . i am in hopes that you may be able to give us just the information we need to clear up this mystery . ”
christie	links	“ i am at your disposal , m. le juge . ask me any questions you please. ” “ to begin with , i understand that this journey was being undertaken at your father ’ s request ? ” “ quite so , m. le juge . i received a telegram bidding me to proceed without delay to buenos ayres , and from thence via the andes to valparaiso and on to santiago . ”
christie	links	“ ah . and the object of this journey ? ” “ i have no idea , m. le juge. ” “ what ? ” “ no . see , here is the telegram. ” the magistrate took it and read it aloud . “ ‘ proceed immediately cherbourg embark _anzora___ sailing tonight buenos ayres . ultimate destination santiago . further instructions will await you buenos ayres . do not fail . matter is of utmost importance . renauld. ’ and there had been no previous correspondence on the matter ? ”
christie	links	jack renauld shook his head . “ that is the only intimation of any kind . i knew , of course , that my father , having lived so long out there , had necessarily many interests in south america . but he had never mooted any suggestion of sending me out . ”
christie	links	“ you have , of course , been a good deal in south america , m. renauld ? ” “ i was there as a child . but i was educated in england , and spent most of my holidays in that country , so i really know far less of south america than might be supposed . you see , the war broke out when i was seventeen . ”
christie	links	“ you served in the english flying corps , did you not ? ” “ yes , m. le juge. ” m. hautet nodded his head , and proceeded with his inquiries along the , by now , well-known lines . in response , jack renauld declared definitely that he knew nothing of any enmity his father might have incurred in the city of santiago , or elsewhere in the south american continent , that he had noticed no change in his father ’ s manner of late , and that he had never heard him refer to a secret . he had regarded the mission to south america as connected with business interests .
christie	links	as m. hautet paused for a minute , the quiet voice of giraud broke in . “ i should like to put a few questions on my own account , m. le juge. ” “ by all means , m. giraud , if you wish , ” said the magistrate coldly .
christie	links	giraud edged his chair a little nearer to the table . “ were you on good terms with your father , m. renauld ? ” “ certainly i was , ” returned the lad haughtily . “ you assert that positively ? ”
christie	links	“ yes. ” “ no little disputes , eh ? ” jack shrugged his shoulders . “ every one may have a difference of opinion now and then. ” “ quite so , quite so . but if any one were to assert that you had a violent quarrel with your father on the eve of your departure for paris , that person , without doubt , would be lying ? ”
christie	links	i could not but admire the ingenuity of giraud . his boast “ i know everything ” had been no idle one . jack renauld was clearly disconcerted by the question . “ we—we did have an argument , ” he admitted .
christie	links	“ ah , an argument ! in the course of that argument did you use this phrase : ‘ when you are dead , i can do as i please ? ’ ” “ i may have done , ” muttered the other . “ i don ’ t know . ”
christie	links	“ in response to that , did your father say : ‘ but i am not dead yet ! ’ to which you responded : ‘ i wish you were ! ’ ” the boy made no answer . his hands fiddled nervously with the things on the table in front of him .
christie	links	“ i must request an answer , please , m. renauld , ” said giraud sharply . with an angry exclamation , the boy swept a heavy paper-knife on to the floor . “ what does it matter ? you might as well know . yes , i did quarrel with my father . i dare say i said all those things—i was so angry i can not even remember what i said ! i was furious—i could almost have killed him at that moment—there , make the most of that ! ” he leant back in his chair , flushed and defiant .
christie	links	giraud smiled , then , moving his chair back a little , said : “ that is all . you would , without doubt , prefer to continue the interrogatory , m. le juge. ” “ ah , yes , exactly , ” said m. hautet . “ and what was the subject of your quarrel ? ”
christie	links	“ i decline to state. ” m. hautet sat up in his chair . “ m . renauld , it is not permitted to trifle with the law ! ” he thundered . “ what was the subject of the quarrel ? ”
christie	links	young renauld remained silent , his boyish face sullen and overcast . but another voice spoke , imperturbable and calm , the voice of hercule poirot . “ i will inform you , if you like , m. le juge . ”
christie	links	“ you know ? ” “ certainly i know . the subject of the quarrel was mademoiselle marthe daubreuil. ” renauld sprang round , startled . the magistrate leaned forward . “ is this so , monsieur. ” jack renauld bowed his head .
christie	links	“ yes , ” he admitted . “ i love mademoiselle daubreuil , and i wish to marry her . when i informed my father of the fact , he flew at once into a violent rage . naturally i could not stand hearing the girl i loved insulted , and i , too , lost my temper . ”
christie	links	m. hautet looked across at mrs. renauld . “ you were aware of this—attachment , madame. ” “ i feared it , ” she replied simply . “ mother , ” cried the boy . “ you too ! marthe is as good as she is beautiful . what can you have against her ? ”
christie	links	“ i have nothing against mademoiselle daubreuil in any way . but i should prefer you to marry an englishwoman , or if a frenchwoman not one who has a mother of doubtful antecedents ! ”
christie	links	her rancour against the older woman showed plainly in her voice , and i could well understand that it must have been a bitter blow to her when her only son showed signs of falling in love with the daughter of her rival .
christie	links	mrs. renauld continued , addressing the magistrate : “ i ought , perhaps , to have spoken to my husband on the subject , but i hoped that it was only a boy and girl flirtation which would blow over all the quicker if no notice was taken of it . i blame myself now for my silence , but my husband , as i told you , had seemed so anxious and care-worn , different altogether from his normal self , that i was chiefly concerned not to give him any additional worry . ”
christie	links	m. hautet nodded . “ when you informed your father of your intentions towards mademoiselle daubreuil , ” he resumed , “ he was surprised ? ” “ he seemed completely taken aback . then he ordered me peremptorily to dismiss any such idea from my mind . he would never give his consent to such a marriage . nettled , i demanded what he had against mademoiselle daubreuil . to that he could give no satisfactory reply , but spoke in slighting terms of the mystery surrounding the lives of the mother and daughter . i answered that i was marrying marthe , and not her antecedents , but he shouted me down with a peremptory refusal to discuss the matter in any way . the whole thing must be given up . the injustice and high-handedness of it all maddened me—especially since he himself always seemed to go out of his way to be attentive to the daubreuils and was always suggesting that they should be asked to the house . i lost my head , and we quarrelled in earnest . my father reminded me that i was entirely dependent on him , and it must have been in answer to that that i made the remark about doing as i pleased after his death— ”
christie	links	poirot interrupted with a quick question . “ you were aware , then , of the terms of your father ’ s will ? ” “ i knew that he had left half his fortune to me , the other half in trust for my mother to come to me at her death , ” replied the lad .
christie	links	“ proceed with your story , ” said the magistrate . “ after that we shouted at each other in sheer rage , until i suddenly realized that i was in danger of missing my train to paris . i had to run for the station , still in a white heat of fury . however , once well away , i calmed down . i wrote to marthe , telling her what had happened , and her reply soothed me still further . she pointed out to me that we had only to be steadfast , and any opposition was bound to give way at last . our affection for each other must be tried and proved , and when my parents realized that it was no light infatuation on my part they would doubtless relent towards us . of course , to her , i had not dwelt on my father ’ s principal objection to the match . i soon saw that i should do my cause no good by violence . my father wrote me several letters to paris , affectionate in tone , and which did not refer to our disagreement or its cause , and i replied in the same strain . ”
christie	links	“ you can produce those letters , eh ? ” said giraud . “ i did not keep them. ” “ no matter , ” said the detective . renauld looked at him for a moment , but the magistrate was continuing his questions .
christie	links	“ to pass to another matter , are you acquainted with the name of duveen , m. renauld ? ” “ duveen ? ” said jack . “ duveen ? ” he leant forward , and slowly picked up the paper-knife he had swept from the table . as he lifted his head , his eyes met the watching ones of giraud . “ duveen ? no , i can ’ t say i am . ”
christie	links	“ will you read this letter , m. renauld ? and tell me if you have any idea as to who the person was who addressed it to your father ? ” jack renauld took the letter , and read it through , the colour mounting in his face as he did so .
christie	links	“ addressed to my father ? ” the emotion and indignation in his tones were evident . “ yes . we found it in the pocket of his coat. ” “ does— ” he hesitated , throwing the merest fraction of a glance towards his mother . the magistrate understood .
christie	links	“ as yet—no . can you give us any clue as to the writer ? ” “ i have no idea whatsoever. ” m. hautet sighed . “ a most mysterious case . ah , well , i suppose we can now rule out the letter altogether . what do you think , m. giraud ? it does not seem to lead us anywhere . ”
christie	links	“ it certainly does not , ” agreed the detective with emphasis . “ and yet , ” sighed the magistrate , “ it promised at the beginning to be such a beautiful and simple case ! ” he caught mrs. renauld ’ s eye , and blushed in immediate confusion . “ ah , yes , ” he coughed , turning over the papers on the table . “ let me see , where were we ? oh , the weapon . i fear this may give you pain , m. renauld . i understand it was a present from you to your mother . very sad—very distressing— ”
christie	links	jack renauld leaned forward . his face , which had flushed during the perusal of the letter , was now deadly white . “ do you mean—that it was with an aeroplane wire paper cutter that my father was—was killed ? but it ’ s impossible ! a little thing like that ! ”
christie	links	“ alas , m. renauld , it is only too true ! an ideal little tool , i fear . sharp and easy to handle. ” “ where is it ? can i see it ? is it still in the—the body ? ”
christie	links	“ oh , no , it had been removed . you would like to see it ? to make sure ? it would be as well , perhaps , though madame has already identified it . still—m . bex , might i trouble you ? ”
christie	links	“ certainly , m. le juge . i will fetch it immediately. ” “ would it not be better to take m. renauld to the shed ? ” suggested giraud smoothly . “ without doubt he would wish to see his father ’ s body . ”
christie	links	the boy made a shivering gesture of negation , and the magistrate , always disposed to cross giraud whenever possible , replied . “ but no—not at present . m. bex will be so kind as to bring it to us here . ”
christie	links	the commissary left the room . stonor crossed to jack , and wrung him by the hand . poirot had risen and was adjusting a pair of candlesticks that struck his trained eye as being a shade askew . the magistrate was reading the mysterious love-letter through a last time , clinging desperately to his first theory of jealousy and a stab in the back .
christie	links	suddenly the door burst open and the commissary rushed in . “ m . le juge ! m. le juge ! ” “ but yes . what is it ? ” “ the dagger ! it is gone ! ” “ _comment___—gone ? ” “ vanished . disappeared . the glass jar that contained it is empty ! ”
christie	links	“ what ? ” i cried . “ impossible . why , only this morning i saw— ” the words died on my tongue . but the attention of the entire room was diverted to me . “ what is that you say ? ” cried the commissary . “ this morning ? ”
christie	links	“ i saw it there this morning , ” i said slowly . “ about an hour and a half ago , to be accurate. ” “ you went to the shed , then ? how did you get the key ? ”
christie	links	“ i asked the _sergent de ville___ for it. ” “ and you went there ? why ? ” i hesitated , but in the end i decided that the only thing to do was to make a clean breast of it .
christie	links	“ m . le juge , ” i said . “ i have committed a grave fault , for which i must crave your indulgence. ” “ _eh bien ! ___ proceed , monsieur. ” “ the fact of the matter is , ” i said , wishing myself anywhere else than where i was , “ that i met a young lady , an acquaintance of mine . she displayed a great desire to see everything that was to be seen , and i—well , in short , i took the key to show her the body . ”
christie	links	“ ah , _par exemple___ , ” cried the magistrate indignantly . “ but it is a grave fault you have committed there , captain hastings . it is altogether most irregular . you should not have permitted yourself this folly . ”
christie	links	“ i know , ” i said meekly . “ nothing that you can say could be too severe , m. le juge. ” “ you did not invite this lady to come here ? ” “ certainly not . i met her quite by accident . she is an english lady who happens to be staying in merlinville , though i was not aware of that until my unexpected meeting with her . ”
christie	links	“ well , well , ” said the magistrate , softening . “ it was most irregular , but the lady is without doubt young and beautiful , _n ’ est-ce pas ? ___ what it is to be young ! _o jeunesse , jeunesse ! ___ ” and he sighed sentimentally .
christie	links	but the commissary , less romantic , and more practical , took up the tale : “ but did not you reclose and lock the door when you departed. ” “ that ’ s just it , ” i said slowly . “ that ’ s what i blame myself for so terribly . my friend was upset at the sight . she nearly fainted . i got her some brandy and water , and afterwards insisted on accompanying her back to town . in the excitement , i forgot to relock the door . i only did so when i got back to the villa . ”
christie	links	“ then for twenty minutes at least— ” said the commissary slowly . he stopped . “ exactly , ” i said . “ twenty minutes , ” mused the commissary . “ it is deplorable , ” said m. hautet , his sternness of manner returning . “ without precedent . ”
christie	links	suddenly another voice spoke . “ you find it deplorable , m. le juge ? ” asked giraud . “ certainly i do. ” “ _eh bien ! ___ i find it admirable , ” said the other imperturbably . this unexpected ally quite bewildered me .
christie	links	“ admirable , m. giraud ? ” asked the magistrate , studying him cautiously out of the corner of his eye . “ precisely. ” “ and why ? ” “ because we know now that the assassin , or an accomplice of the assassin , has been near the villa only an hour ago . it will be strange if , with that knowledge , we do not shortly lay hands upon him. ” there was a note of menace in his voice . he continued : “ he risked a good deal to gain possession of that dagger . perhaps he feared that finger-prints might be discovered on it . ”
christie	links	poirot turned to bex . “ you said there were none ? ” giraud shrugged his shoulders . “ perhaps he could not be sure. ” poirot looked at him . “ you are wrong , m. giraud . the assassin wore gloves . so he must have been sure . ”
christie	links	“ i do not say it was the assassin himself . it may have been an accomplice who was not aware of that fact. ” “ _ils sont mal renseignés , les accomplices ! ___ ” muttered poirot , but he said no more .
christie	links	the magistrate ’ s clerk was gathering up the papers on the table . m. hautet addressed us : “ our work here is finished . perhaps , m. renauld , you will listen whilst your evidence is read over to you . i have purposely kept all the proceedings as informal as possible . i have been called original in my methods , but i maintain that there is much to be said for originality . the case is now in the clever hands of the renowned m. giraud . he will without doubt distinguish himself . indeed , i wonder that he has not already laid his hands upon the murderers ! madame , again let me assure you of my heart-felt sympathy . messieurs , i wish you all good day. ” and , accompanied by his clerk and the commissary , he took his departure .
christie	links	poirot tugged out that large turnip of a watch of his , and observed the time . “ let us return to the hotel for lunch , my friend , ” he said . “ and you shall recount to me in full the indiscretions of this morning . no one is observing us . we need make no adieux . ”
christie	links	we went quietly out of the room . the examining magistrate had just driven off in his car . i was going down the steps when poirot ’ s voice arrested me : “ one little moment , my friend. ” dexterously , he whipped out his yard measure , and proceeded , quite solemnly , to measure an overcoat hanging in the hall from the collar to the hem . i had not seen it hanging there before , and guessed that it belonged to either mr. stonor , or jack renauld .
christie	links	then , with a little satisfied grunt , poirot returned the measure to his pocket , and followed me out into the open air . 12 poirot elucidates certain points “ why did you measure that overcoat ? ” i asked , with some curiosity , as we walked down the hot white road at a leisurely pace .
christie	links	“ _parbleu ! ___ to see how long it was , ” replied my friend imperturbably . i was vexed . poirot ’ s incurable habit of making a mystery out of nothing never failed to irritate me . i relapsed into silence , and followed a train of thought of my own . although i had not noticed them specially at the time , certain words mrs. renauld had addressed to her son now recurred to me , fraught with a new significance . “ so you did not sail ? ” she had said , and then had added : “ _after all , it does not matter—now.___ ”
christie	links	what had she meant by that ? the words were enigmatical—significant . was it possible that she knew more than we supposed ? she had denied all knowledge of the mysterious mission with which her husband was to have entrusted his son . but was she really less ignorant than she pretended ? could she enlighten us if she chose , and was her silence part of a carefully thought out and preconceived plan ?
christie	links	the more i thought about it , the more i was convinced that i was right . mrs. renauld knew more than she chose to tell . in her surprise at seeing her son , she had momentarily betrayed herself . i felt convinced that she knew , if not the assassins , at least the motive for the assassination . but some very powerful considerations must keep her silent .
christie	links	“ you think profoundly , my friend , ” remarked poirot , breaking in upon my reflections . “ what is it that intrigues you so ? ” i told him , sure of my ground , though feeling expectant that he would ridicule my suspicions . but to my surprise he nodded thoughtfully .
christie	links	“ you are quite right , hastings . from the beginning i have been sure that she was keeping something back . at first i suspected her , if not of inspiring , at least of conniving at the crime . ”
christie	links	“ you suspected _her ? ___ ” i cried . “ but certainly ! she benefits enormously—in fact , by this new will , she is the only person to benefit . so , from the start , she was singled out for attention . you may have noticed that i took an early opportunity of examining her wrists . i wished to see whether there was any possibility that she had gagged and bound herself . _eh bien___ , i saw at once that there was no fake , the cords had actually been drawn so tight as to cut into the flesh . that ruled out the possibility of her having committed the crime single-handed . but it was still possible for her to have connived at it , or to have been the instigator with an accomplice . moreover , the story , as she told it , was singularly familiar to me—the masked men that she could not recognize , the mention of ‘ the secret ’ —i had heard , or read , all these things before . another little detail confirmed my belief that she was not speaking the truth . _the wrist watch , hastings , the wrist watch ! ___ ”
christie	links	again that wrist watch ! poirot was eyeing me curiously . “ you see , _mon ami ? ___ you comprehend ? ” “ no , ” i replied with some ill humour . “ i neither see nor comprehend . you make all these confounded mysteries , and it ’ s useless asking you to explain . you always like keeping everything up your sleeve to the last minute . ”
christie	links	“ do not enrage yourself , my friend , ” said poirot with a smile . “ i will explain if you wish . but not a word to giraud , _c ’ est entendu ? ___ he treats me as an old one of no importance ! _we shall see ! ___ in common fairness i gave him a hint . if he does not choose to act upon it , that is his own look out . ”
christie	links	i assured poirot that he could rely upon my discretion . “ _c ’ est bien ! ___ let us then employ our little grey cells . tell me , my friend , at what time , according to you , did the tragedy take place ? ”
christie	links	“ why , at two o ’ clock or thereabouts , ” i said , astonished . “ you remember , mrs. renauld told us that she heard the clock strike while the men were in the room. ” “ exactly , and on the strength of that , you , the examining magistrate , bex , and every one else , accept the time without further question . but i , hercule poirot , say that madame renauld lied . _the crime took place at least two hours earlier.___ ”
christie	links	“ but the doctors— ” “ they declared , after examination of the body , that death had taken place between ten and seven hours previously . _mon ami___ , for some reason , it was imperative that the crime should seem to have taken place later than it actually did . you have read of a smashed watch or clock recording the exact hour of a crime ? so that the time should not rest on mrs. renauld ’ s testimony alone , some one moved on the hands of that wrist watch to two o ’ clock , and then dashed it violently to the ground . but , as is often the case , they defeated their own object . the glass was smashed , but the mechanism of the watch was uninjured . it was a most disastrous manoeuvre on their part , for it at once drew my attention to two points—first , that madame renauld was lying : secondly , that there must be some vital reason for the postponement of the time . ”
christie	links	“ but what reason could there be ? ” “ ah , that is the question ! there we have the whole mystery . as yet , i can not explain it . there is only one idea that presents itself to me as having a possible connection . ”
christie	links	“ and that is ? ” “ the last train left merlinville at seventeen minutes past twelve. ” i followed it out slowly . “ so that , the crime apparently taking place some two hours later , any one leaving by that train would have an unimpeachable alibi ! ”
christie	links	“ perfect , hastings ! you have it ! ” i sprang up . “ but we must inquire at the station . surely they can not have failed to notice two foreigners who left by that train ! we must go there at once ! ”
christie	links	“ you think so , hastings ? ” “ of course . let us go there now. ” poirot restrained my ardour with a light touch upon the arm . “ go by all means if you wish , _mon ami___—but if you go , i should not ask for particulars of two foreigners . ”
christie	links	i stared , and he said rather impatiently : “ là , là , you do not believe all that rigmarole , do you ? the masked men and all the rest of _cette histoire-là ! ___ ” his words took me so much aback that i hardly knew how to respond . he went on serenely :
christie	links	“ you heard me say to giraud , did you not , that all the details of this crime were familiar to me ? _eh bien___ , that presupposes one of two things , either the brain that planned the first crime also planned this one , or else an account read of a _cause célèbre___ unconsciously remained in our assassin ’ s memory and prompted the details . i shall be able to pronounce definitely on that after— ” he broke off .
christie	links	i was revolving sundry matters in my mind . “ but mr. renauld ’ s letter ? it distinctly mentions a secret and santiago ? ” “ undoubtedly there was a secret in m. renauld ’ s life—there can be no doubt of that . on the other hand , the word santiago , to my mind , is a red herring , dragged continually across the track to put us off the scent . it is possible that it was used in the same way on m. renauld , to keep him from directing his suspicions into a quarter nearer at hand . oh , be assured , hastings , the danger that threatened him was not in santiago , it was near at hand , in france . ”
christie	links	he spoke so gravely , and with such assurance , that i could not fail to be convinced . but i essayed one final objection : “ and the match and cigarette end found near the body ? what of them . ”
christie	links	a light of pure enjoyment lit up poirot ’ s face . “ planted ! deliberately planted there for giraud or one of his tribe to find ! ah , he is smart , giraud , he can do his tricks ! so can a good retriever dog . he comes in so pleased with himself . for hours he has crawled on his stomach . ‘ see what i have found , ’ he says . and then again to me : ‘ what do you see here ? ’ me , i answer , with profound and deep truth , ‘ nothing. ’ and giraud , the great giraud , he laughs , he thinks to himself , ‘ oh , that he is imbecile , this old one ! ’ _but we shall see.…___ ”
christie	links	but my mind had reverted to the main facts . “ then all this story of the masked men— ? ” “ is false. ” “ what really happened ? ” poirot shrugged his shoulders . “ one person could tell us—madame renauld . but she will not speak . threats and entreaties would not move her . a remarkable woman that , hastings . i recognized as soon as i saw her that i had to deal with a woman of unusual character . at first , as i told you , i was inclined to suspect her of being concerned in the crime . afterwards i altered my opinion . ”
christie	links	“ what made you do that ? ” “ her spontaneous and genuine grief at the sight of her husband ’ s body . i could swear that the agony in that cry of hers was genuine . ”
christie	links	“ yes , ” i said thoughtfully , “ one can not mistake these things. ” “ i beg your pardon , my friend—one can always be mistaken . regard a great actress , does not her acting of grief carry you away and impress you with its reality ? no , however strong my own impression and belief , i needed other evidence before i allowed myself to be satisfied . the great criminal can be a great actor . i base my certainty in this case , not upon my own impression , but upon the undeniable fact that mrs. renauld actually fainted . i turned up her eyelids and felt her pulse . there was no deception—the swoon was genuine . therefore i was satisfied that her anguish was real and not assumed . besides , a small additional point not without interest , it was unnecessary for mrs. renauld to exhibit unrestrained grief . she had had one paroxysm on learning of her husband ’ s death , and there would be no need for her to simulate another such a violent one on beholding his body . no , mrs. renauld was not her husband ’ s murderess . but why has she lied ? she lied about the wrist watch , she lied about the masked men—she lied about a third thing . tell me , hastings , what is your explanation of the open door ? ”
christie	links	“ well , ” i said , rather embarrassed , “ i suppose it was an oversight . they forgot to shut it. ” poirot shook his head , and sighed . “ that is the explanation of giraud . it does not satisfy me . there is a meaning behind that open door which for a moment i can not fathom . ”
christie	links	“ i have an idea , ” i cried suddenly . “ _a la bonne heure ! ___ let us hear it. ” “ listen . we are agreed that mrs. renauld ’ s story is a fabrication . is it not possible , then , that mr. renauld left the house to keep an appointment—possibly with the murderer—leaving the front door open for his return . but he did not return , and the next morning he is found , stabbed in the back . ”
christie	links	“ an admirable theory , hastings , but for two facts which you have characteristically overlooked . in the first place , who gagged and bound madame renauld ? and why on earth should they return to the house to do so ? in the second place , no man on earth would go out to keep an appointment wearing his underclothes and an overcoat . there are circumstances in which a man might wear pajamas and an overcoat—but the other , never ! ”
christie	links	“ true , ” i said , rather crest-fallen . “ no , ” continued poirot , “ we must look elsewhere for a solution of the open door mystery . one thing i am fairly sure of—they did not leave through the door . they left by the window . ”
christie	links	“ what ? ” “ precisely. ” “ but there were no footmarks in the flower bed underneath. ” “ no—_and there ought to have been.___ listen , hastings . the gardener , auguste , as you heard him say , planted both those beds the preceding afternoon . in the one there are plentiful impressions of his big hobnailed boots—in the other , _none ! ___ you see ? some one had passed that way , some one who , to obliterate their footprints , smoothed over the surface of the bed with a rake . ”
christie	links	“ where did they get a rake ? ” “ where they got the spade and the gardening gloves , ” said poirot impatiently . “ there is no difficulty about that. ” “ what makes you think that they left that way , though ? surely it is more probable that they entered by the window , and left by the door . ”
christie	links	“ that is possible of course . yet i have a strong idea that they left by the window. ” “ i think you are wrong. ” “ perhaps , _mon ami___. ” i mused , thinking over the new field of conjecture that poirot ’ s deductions had opened up to me . i recalled my wonder at his cryptic allusions to the flower bed and the wrist watch . his remarks had seemed so meaningless at the moment and now , for the first time , i realized how remarkably , from a few slight incidents , he had unravelled much of the mystery that surrounded the case . i paid a belated homage to my friend . as though he read my thoughts , he nodded sagely .
christie	links	“ method , you comprehend ! method ! arrange your facts . arrange your ideas . and if some little fact will not fit in—do not reject it but consider it closely . though its significance escapes you , be sure that it is significant . ”
christie	links	“ in the meantime , ” i said , considering , “ although we know a great deal more than we did , we are no nearer to solving the mystery of who killed mr. renauld. ” “ no , ” said poirot cheerfully . “ in fact we are a great deal further off . ”
christie	links	the fact seemed to afford him such peculiar satisfaction that i gazed at him in wonder . he met my eye and smiled . “ but yes , it is better so . before , there was at all events a clear theory as to how and by whose hands he met his death . now that is all gone . we are in darkness . a hundred conflicting points confuse and worry us . that is well . that is excellent . out of confusion comes forth order . but if you find order to start with , if a crime seems simple and above-board , _eh bien , méfiez vous ! ___ it is , how do you say it ? —_cooked ! ___ the great criminal is simple—but very few criminals _are___ great . in trying to cover up their tracks , they invariably betray themselves . ah , _mon ami___ , i would that some day i could meet a really great criminal—one who commits his crime , and then—does nothing ! even i , hercule poirot , might fail to catch such a one . ”
christie	links	but i had not followed his words . a light had burst upon me . “ poirot ! mrs. renauld ! i see it now . she must be shielding somebody. ” from the quietness with which poirot received my remark , i could see that the idea had already occurred to him .
christie	links	“ yes , ” he said thoughtfully . “ shielding some one—or screening some one . one of the two. ” i saw very little difference between the two words , but i developed my theme with a good deal of earnestness . poirot maintained a strictly non-committal attitude , repeating :
christie	links	“ it may be—yes , it may be . but as yet i do not know ! there is something very deep underneath all this . you will see . something very deep. ” then , as we entered our hotel , he enjoined silence on me with a gesture .
christie	links	13 the girl with the anxious eyes we lunched with an excellent appetite . i understood well enough that poirot did not wish to discuss the tragedy where we could so easily be overheard . but , as is usual when one topic fills the mind to the exclusion of everything else , no other subject of interest seemed to present itself . for a while we ate in silence , and then poirot observed maliciously :
christie	links	“ _eh bien ! ___ and your indiscretions ! you recount them not ? ” i felt myself blushing . “ oh , you mean this morning ? ” i endeavoured to adopt a tone of absolute nonchalance . but i was no match for poirot . in a very few minutes he had extracted the whole story from me , his eyes twinkling as he did so .
christie	links	“ _tiens ! ___ a story of the most romantic . what is her name , this charming young lady ? ” i had to confess that i did not know . “ still more romantic ! the first _rencontre___ in the train from paris , the second here . journeys end in lovers ’ meetings , is not that the saying ? ”
christie	links	“ don ’ t be an ass , poirot. ” “ yesterday it was mademoiselle daubreuil , today it is mademoiselle—cinderella ! decidedly you have the heart of a turk , hastings ! you should establish a harem ! ” “ it ’ s all very well to rag me . mademoiselle daubreuil is a very beautiful girl , and i do admire her immensely—i don ’ t mind admitting it . the other ’ s nothing—don ’ t suppose i shall ever see her again . she was quite amusing to talk to just for a railway journey , but she ’ s not the kind of girl i should ever get keen on . ”
christie	links	“ why ? ” “ well—it sounds snobbish perhaps—but she ’ s not a lady , not in any sense of the word. ” poirot nodded thoughtfully . there was less raillery in his voice as he asked : “ you believe , then , in birth and breeding ? ”
christie	links	“ i may be old-fashioned , but i certainly don ’ t believe in marrying out of one ’ s class . it never answers. ” “ i agree with you , _mon ami___ . ninety-nine times out of a hundred , it is as you say . but there is always the hundredth time ! still , that does not arise , as you do not propose to see the lady again . ”
christie	links	his last words were almost a question , and i was aware of the sharpness with which he darted a glance at me . and before my eyes , writ large in letters of fire , i saw the words “ hôtel du phare , ” and i heard again her voice saying “ come and look me up ” and my own answering with _empressement___ : “ i will . ”
christie	links	well , what of it ? i had meant to go at the time . but since then , i had had time to reflect . i did not like the girl . thinking it over in cold blood , i came definitely to the conclusion that i disliked her intensely . i had got hauled over the coals for foolishly gratifying her morbid curiosity , and i had not the least wish to see her again .
christie	links	i answered poirot lightly enough . “ she asked me to look her up , but of course i shan ’ t. ” “ why ‘ of course ’ ? ” “ well—i don ’ t want to. ” “ i see. ” he studied me attentively for some minutes . “ yes . i see very well . and you are wise . stick to what you have said . ”
christie	links	“ that seems to be your invariable advice , ” i remarked , rather piqued . “ ah , my friend , have faith in papa poirot . some day , if you permit , i will arrange you a marriage of great suitability . ”
christie	links	“ thank you , ” i said laughing , “ but the prospect leaves me cold. ” poirot sighed and shook his head . “ _les anglais ! ___ ” he murmured . “ no method—absolutely none whatever . they leave all to chance ! ” he frowned , and altered the position of the salt cellar .
christie	links	“ mademoiselle cinderella is staying at the hôtel d ’ angleterre you told me , did you not ? ” “ no . hôtel du phare. ” “ true , i forgot. ” a moment ’ s misgiving shot across my mind . surely i had never mentioned any hotel to poirot . i looked across at him , and felt reassured . he was cutting his bread into neat little squares , completely absorbed in his task . he must have fancied i had told him where the girl was staying .
christie	links	we had coffee outside facing the sea . poirot smoked one of his tiny cigarettes , and then drew his watch from his pocket . “ the train to paris leaves at 2:25 , ” he observed . “ i should be starting . ”
christie	links	“ paris ? ” i cried . “ that is what i said , _mon ami___. ” “ you are going to paris ? but why ? ” he replied very seriously . “ to look for the murderer of m. renauld. ” “ you think he is in paris ? ”
christie	links	“ i am quite certain that he is not . nevertheless , it is there that i must look for him . you do not understand , but i will explain it all to you in good time . believe me , this journey to paris is necessary . i shall not be away long . in all probability i shall return tomorrow . i do not propose that you should accompany me . remain here and keep an eye on giraud . also cultivate the society of m. renauld _fils___ . and thirdly , if you wish , endeavour to cut him out with mademoiselle marthe . but i fear you will not have great success . ”
christie	links	i did not quite relish the last remark . “ that reminds me , ” i said . “ i meant to ask you how you knew about those two ? ” “ _mon ami___—i know human nature . throw together a boy young renauld and a beautiful girl like mademoiselle marthe , and the result is almost inevitable . then , the quarrel ! it was money or a woman and , remembering léonie ’ s description of the lad ’ s anger , i decided on the latter . so i made my guess—and i was right . ”
christie	links	“ and that was why you warned me against setting my heart on the lady ? you already suspected that she loved young renauld ? ” poirot smiled . “ at any rate—_i saw that she had anxious eyes.___ that is how always think of mademoiselle daubreuil _as the girl with the anxious eyes.…___ ”
christie	links	his voice was so grave that it impressed me uncomfortably . “ what do you mean by that , poirot ? ” “ i fancy , my friend , that we shall see before very long . but i must start . ”
christie	links	“ you ’ ve oceans of time. ” “ perhaps—perhaps . but i like plenty of leisure at the station . i do not wish to rush , to hurry , to excite myself. ” “ at all events , ” i said , rising , “ i will come and see you off . ”
christie	links	“ you will do nothing of the sort . i forbid it. ” he was so peremptory that i stared at him in surprise . he nodded emphatically . “ i mean it , _mon ami___ . au revoir ! you permit that i embrace you ? ah , no , i forget that it is not the english custom . une poignee de main , alors . ”
christie	links	i felt rather at a loose end after poirot had left me . i strolled down the beach , and watched the bathers , without feeling energetic enough to join them . i rather fancied that cinderella might be disporting herself amongst them in some wonderful costume , but i saw no signs of her . i strolled aimlessly along the sands towards the further end of the town . it occurred to me that , after all , it would only be decent feeling on my part to inquire after the girl . and it would save trouble in the end . the matter would then be finished with . there would be no need for me to trouble about her any further . but , if i did not go at all , she might quite possibly come and look me up at the villa . and that would be annoying in every way . decidedly it would be better to pay a short call , in the course of which i could make it quite clear that i could do nothing further for her in my capacity of showman .
christie	links	accordingly i left the beach , and walked inland . i soon found the hôtel du phare , a very unpretentious building . it was annoying in the extreme not to know the lady ’ s name and , to save my dignity , i decided to stroll inside and look around . probably i should find her in the lounge . merlinville was a small place , you left your hotel to go to the beach , and you left the beach to return to the hotel . there were no other attractions . there was a casino being built , but it was not yet completed .
christie	links	i had walked the length of the beach without seeing her , therefore she must be in the hotel . i went in . several people were sitting in the tiny lounge , but my quarry was not amongst them . i looked into some other rooms , but there was no sign of her . i waited for some time , till my impatience got the better of me . i took the concierge aside , and slipped five francs into his hand .
christie	links	“ i wish to see a lady who is staying here . a young english lady , small and dark . i am not sure of her name. ” the man shook his head , and seemed to be suppressing a grin .
christie	links	“ there is no such lady as you describe staying here. ” “ she is american possibly , ” i suggested . these fellows are so stupid . but the man continued to shake his head . “ no , monsieur . there are only six or seven english and american ladies altogether , and they are all much older than the lady you are seeking . it is not here that you will find her , monsieur . ”
christie	links	he was so positive that i felt doubts . “ but the lady told me she was staying here. ” “ monsieur must have made a mistake—or it is more likely the lady did , since there has been another gentleman here inquiring for her . ”
christie	links	“ what is that you say ? ” i cried , surprised . “ but yes , monsieur . a gentleman who described her just as you have done. ” “ what was he like ? ” “ he was a small gentleman , well dressed , very neat , very spotless , the moustache very stiff , the head of a peculiar shape , and the eyes green . ”
christie	links	poirot ! so that was why he refused to let me accompany him to the station . the impertinence of it ! i would thank him not to meddle in my concerns . did he fancy i needed a nurse to look after me ? thanking the man , i departed , somewhat at a loss , and still much incensed with my meddlesome friend . i regretted that he was , for the moment , out of reach . i should have enjoyed telling him what i thought of his unwarranted interference . had i not distinctly told him that i had no intention of seeing the girl ? decidedly , one ’ s friends can be too zealous !
christie	links	but where was the lady ? i set aside my wrath , and tried to puzzle it out . evidently , through inadvertence , she had named the wrong hotel . then another thought struck me . was it inadvertence ? or had she deliberately withheld her name and given me the wrong address ? the more i thought about it , the more i felt convinced that this last surmise of mine was right . for some reason or other she did not wish to let the acquaintance ripen into friendship . and though half an hour earlier this had been precisely my own view , i did not enjoy having the tables turned upon me . the whole affair was profoundly unsatisfactory , and i went up to the villa geneviève in a condition of distinct ill humour . i did not go to the house , but went up the path to the little bench by the shed , and sat there moodily enough .
christie	links	i was distracted from my thoughts by the sound of voices close at hand . in a second or two i realized that they came , not from the garden i was in , but from the adjoining garden of the villa marguerite , and that they were approaching rapidly . a girl ’ s voice was speaking , a voice that i recognized as that of the beautiful marthe .
christie	links	“ _chéri___ , ” she was saying , “ is it really true ? are all our troubles over. ” “ you know it , marthe , ” jack renauld replied . “ nothing can part us now , beloved . the last obstacle to our union is removed . nothing can take you from me . ”
christie	links	“ nothing ? ” the girl murmured . “ oh , jack , jack—i am afraid. ” i had moved to depart , realizing that i was quite unintentionally eavesdropping . as i rose to my feet , i caught sight of them through a gap in the hedge . they stood together facing me , the man ’ s arm round the girl , his eyes looking into hers . they were a splendid looking couple , the dark , well-knit boy , and the fair young goddess . they seemed made for each other as they stood there , happy in spite of the terrible tragedy that overshadowed their young lives .
christie	links	but the girl ’ s face was troubled , and jack renauld seemed to recognize it , as he held her closer to him and asked : “ but what are you afraid of , darling ? what is there to fear—now ? ”
christie	links	and then i saw the look in her eyes , the look poirot had spoken of , as she murmured , so that i almost guessed at the words . “ i am afraid—for _you___.… ”
christie	links	i did not hear young renauld ’ s answer , for my attention was distracted by an unusual appearance a little further down the hedge . there appeared to be a brown bush there , which seemed odd , to say the least of it , so early in the summer . i stepped along to investigate , but , at my advance , the brown bush withdrew itself precipitately , and faced me with a finger to its lips . it was giraud .
christie	links	enjoining caution , he led the way round the shed until we were out of ear-shot . “ what were you doing there ? ” i asked . “ exactly what you were doing—listening. ” “ but i was not there on purpose ! ”
christie	links	“ ah ! ” said giraud . “ i was. ” as always , i admired the man whilst disliking him . he looked me up and down with a sort of contemptuous disfavour . “ you didn ’ t help matters by butting in . i might have heard something useful in a minute . what have you done with your old fossil ? ”
christie	links	“ m . poirot has gone to paris , ” i replied coldly . “ and i can tell you , m. giraud , that he is anything but an old fossil . he has solved many cases that have completely baffled the english police . ”
christie	links	“ bah ! the english police ! ” giraud snapped his fingers disdainfully . “ they must be on a level with our examining magistrates . so he has gone to paris , has he ? well , a good thing . the longer he stays there , the better . but what does he think he will find there ? ”
christie	links	i thought i read in the question a tinge of uneasiness . i drew myself up . “ that i am not at liberty to say , ” i said quietly . giraud subjected me to a piercing stare .
christie	links	“ he has probably enough sense not to tell _you___ , ” he remarked rudely . “ good afternoon . i ’ m busy. ” and with that , he turned on his heel , and left me without ceremony . matters seemed at a standstill at the villa geneviève . giraud evidently did not desire my company and , from what i had seen , it seemed fairly certain that jack renauld did not either .
christie	links	i went back to the town , had an enjoyable bath and returned to the hotel . i turned in early , wondering whether the following day would bring forth anything of interest .
christie	links	i was wholly unprepared for what it did bring forth . i was eating my petit déjeuner in the dining-room , when the waiter , who had been talking to some one outside , came back in obvious excitement . he hesitated for a minute , fidgeting with his napkin , and then burst out .
christie	links	“ monsieur will pardon me , but he is connected , is he not , with the affair at the villa geneviève ? ’ “ yes , ” i said eagerly . “ why ? ” “ monsieur has not heard the news , though ? ”
christie	links	“ what news ? ” “ that there has been another murder there last night ! ” “ _what ? ___ ” leaving my breakfast , i caught up my hat and ran as fast as i could . another murder—and poirot away ! what fatality . but who had been murdered ?
christie	links	i dashed in at the gate . a group of the servants was in the drive , talking and gesticulating . i caught hold of françoise . “ what has happened ? ” “ oh , monsieur ! monsieur ! another death ! it is terrible . there is a curse upon the house . but yes , i say it , a curse ! they should send for m. le curé to bring some holy water . never will i sleep another night under that roof . it might be my turn , who knows ? ”
christie	links	she crossed herself . “ yes , ” i cried , “ but who has been killed ? ” “ do i know—me ? a man—a stranger . they found him up there—in the shed—not a hundred yards from where they found poor monsieur . and that is not all . he is stabbed—stabbed to the heart _with the same dagger ! ___ ”
christie	links	14 the second body waiting for no more , i turned and ran up the path to the shed . the two men on guard there stood aside to let me pass and , filled with excitement , i entered .
christie	links	the light was dim , the place was a mere rough wooden erection to keep old pots and tools in . i had entered impetuously , but on the threshold i checked myself , fascinated by the spectacle before me .
christie	links	giraud was on his hands and knees , a pocket torch in his hand with which he was examining every inch of the ground . he looked up with a frown at my entrance , then his face relaxed a little in a sort of good-humoured contempt .
christie	links	“ ah , _c ’ est l ’ anglais ! ___ enter then . let us see what you can make of this affair. ” rather stung by his tone , i stooped my head , and passed in . “ there he is , ” said giraud , flashing his torch to the far corner .
christie	links	i stepped across . the dead man lay straight upon his back . he was of medium height , swarthy of complexion , and possibly about fifty years of age . he was neatly dressed in a dark blue suit , well cut and probably made by an expensive tailor , but not new . his face was terribly convulsed , and on his left side , just over the heart , the hilt of a dagger stood up , black and shining . i recognized it . it was the same dagger i had seen reposing in the glass jar the preceding morning !
christie	links	“ i ’ m expecting the doctor any minute , ” explained giraud . “ although we hardly need him . there ’ s no doubt what the man died of . he was stabbed to the heart , and death must have been pretty well instantaneous . ”
christie	links	“ when was it done ? last night ? ” giraud shook his head . “ hardly . i don ’ t lay down the law on medical evidence , but the man ’ s been dead well over twelve hours . when do you say you last saw that dagger ? ”
christie	links	“ about ten o ’ clock yesterday morning. ” “ then i should be inclined to fix the crime as being done not long after that. ” “ but people were passing and repassing this shed continually . ”
christie	links	giraud laughed disagreeably . “ you progress to a marvel ! who told you he was killed in this shed ? ” “ well— ” i felt flustered . “ i—i assumed it. ” “ oh , what a fine detective ! look at him , _mon petit___—does a man stabbed to the heart fall like that—neatly with his feet together , and his arms to his side ? no . again does a man lie down on his back and permit himself to be stabbed without raising a hand to defend himself ? it is absurd , is it not ? but see here—and here— ” he flashed the torch along the ground . i saw curious irregular marks in the soft dirt . “ he was dragged here after he was dead . half dragged , half carried by two people . their tracks do not show on the hard ground outside , and here they have been careful to obliterate them—but one of the two was a woman , my young friend . ”
christie	links	“ a woman ? ” “ yes. ” “ but if the tracks are obliterated , how do you know ? ” “ because , blurred as they are , the prints of the woman ’ s shoe are unmistakable . also , by _this___— ” and , leaning forward , he drew something from the handle of the dagger and held it up for me to see . it was a woman ’ s long black hair—similar to the one poirot had taken from the arm-chair in the library .
christie	links	with a slightly ironic smile he wound it round the dagger again . “ we will leave things as they are as much as possible , ” he explained . “ it pleases the examining magistrate . _eh bien___ , do you notice anything else ? ”
christie	links	i was forced to shake my head . “ look at his hands. ” i did . the nails were broken and discoloured , and the skin was hard . it hardly enlightened me as much as i should have liked it to have done . i looked up at giraud .
christie	links	“ they are not the hands of a gentleman , ” he said , answering my look . “ on the contrary his clothes are those of a well-to-do man . that is curious , is it not ? ”
christie	links	“ very curious , ” i agreed . “ and none of his clothing is marked . what do we learn from that ? this man was trying to pass himself off as other than he was . he was masquerading . why ? did he fear something ? was he trying to escape by disguising himself ? as yet we do not know , but one thing we do know—he was as anxious to conceal his identity as we are to discover it . ”
christie	links	he looked down at the body again . “ as before there are no finger-prints on the handle of the dagger . the murderer again wore gloves. ” “ you think , then , that the murderer was the same in both cases ? ” i asked eagerly .
christie	links	giraud became inscrutable . “ never mind what i think . we shall see . marchaud ! ” the _sergent de ville___ appeared at the doorway . “ monsieur ? ” “ why is madame renauld not here ? i sent for her a quarter of an hour ago ? ”
christie	links	“ she is coming up the path now , monsieur , and her son with her. ” “ good . i only want one at a time , though. ” marchaud saluted and disappeared again . a moment later he reappeared with mrs. renauld .
christie	links	“ here is madame. ” giraud came forward with a curt bow . “ this way , madame. ” he led her across , and then , standing suddenly aside . “ here is the man . do you know him ? ”
christie	links	and as he spoke , his eyes , gimlet-like , bored into her face , seeking to read her mind , noting every indication of her manner . but mrs. renauld remained perfectly calm—too calm , i felt . she looked down at the corpse almost without interest , certainly without any sign of agitation or recognition .
christie	links	“ no , ” she said . “ i have never seen him in my life . he is quite a stranger to me. ” “ you are sure ? ” “ quite sure. ” “ you do not recognize in him one of your assailants , for instance ? ”
christie	links	“ no , ” she seemed to hesitate , as though struck by the idea . “ no , i do not think so . of course they wore beards—false ones the examining magistrate thought , but still—no. ” now she seemed to make her mind up definitely . “ i am sure neither of the two was this man . ”
christie	links	“ very well , madame . that is all , then. ” she stepped out with head erect , the sun flashing on the silver threads in her hair . jack renauld succeeded her . he , too , failed to identify the man , in a completely natural manner .
christie	links	giraud merely grunted . whether he was pleased or chagrined i could not tell . he merely called to marchaud : “ you have got the other there ? ” “ yes , monsieur. ” “ bring her in then . ”
christie	links	“ the other ” was madame daubreuil . she came indignantly , protesting with vehemence . “ i object , monsieur ! this is an outrage ! what have i to do with all this ? ” “ madame , ” said giraud brutally , “ i am investigating not one murder , but two murders ! for all i know you may have committed them both . ”
christie	links	“ how dare you ? ” she cried . “ how dare you insult me by such a wild accusation ! it is infamous. ” “ infamous , is it ? what about this ? ” stooping , he again detached the hair , and held it up . “ do you see this , madame ? ” he advanced towards her . “ you permit that i see whether it matches ? ”
christie	links	with a cry she started backwards , white to the lips . “ it is false—i swear it . i know nothing of the crime—of either crime . any one who says i do lies ! ah ! _mon dieu___ , what shall i do ? ”
christie	links	“ calm yourself , madame , ” said giraud coldly . “ no one has accused you as yet . but you will do well to answer my questions without more ado. ” “ anything you wish , monsieur. ” “ look at the dead man . have you ever seen him before ? ”
christie	links	drawing nearer , a little of the colour creeping back to her face , madame daubreuil looked down at the victim with a certain amount of interest and curiosity . then she shook her head .
christie	links	“ i do not know him. ” it seemed impossible to doubt her , the words came so naturally . giraud dismissed her with a nod of the head . “ you are letting her go ? ” i asked in a low voice . “ is that wise ? surely that black hair is from her head . ”
christie	links	“ i do not need teaching my business , ” said giraud dryly . “ she is under surveillance . i have no wish to arrest her as yet. ” then , frowning , he gazed down at the body .
christie	links	“ should you say that was a spanish type at all ? ” he asked suddenly . i considered the face carefully . “ no , ” i said at last . “ i should put him down as a frenchman most decidedly . ”
christie	links	giraud gave a grunt of dissatisfaction . “ same here. ” he stood there for a moment , then with an imperative gesture he waved me aside , and once more , on hands and knees , he continued his search of the floor of the shed . he was marvellous . nothing escaped him . inch by inch he went over the floor , turning over pots , examining old sacks . he pounced on a bundle by the door , but it proved to be only a ragged coat and trousers , and he flung it down again with a snarl . two pairs of old gloves interested him , but in the end he shook his head and laid them aside . then he went back to the pots , methodically turning them over one by one . in the end , he rose to his feet , and shook his head thoughtfully . he seemed baffled and perplexed . i think he had forgotten my presence .
christie	links	but , at that moment , a stir and bustle was heard outside , and our old friend , the examining magistrate , accompanied by his clerk and m. bex , with the doctor behind him , came bustling in .
christie	links	“ but this is extraordinary , mr. giraud , ” cried m. hautet . “ another crime ! ah , we have not got to the bottom of this case . there is some deep mystery here . but who is the victim this time ? ”
christie	links	“ that is just what nobody can tell us , m. le juge . he has not been identified. ” “ where is the body ? ” asked the doctor . giraud moved aside a little . “ there in the corner . he has been stabbed to the heart , as you see . and with the dagger that was stolen yesterday morning . i fancy that the murder followed hard upon the theft—but that is for you to say . you can handle the dagger freely—there are no finger-prints on it . ”
christie	links	the doctor knelt down by the dead man , and giraud turned to the examining magistrate . “ a pretty little problem , is it not ? but i shall solve it. ” “ and so no one can identify him , ” mused the magistrate . “ could it possibly be one of the assassins ? they may have fallen out among themselves . ”
christie	links	giraud shook his head . “ the man is a frenchman—i would take my oath of that— ” but at that moment they were interrupted by the doctor who was sitting back on his heels with a perplexed expression .
christie	links	“ you say he was killed yesterday morning ? ” “ i fix it by the theft of the dagger , ” explained giraud . “ he may , of course , have been killed later in the day. ” “ later in the day ? fiddlesticks ! this man has been dead at least forty-eight hours , and probably longer . ”
christie	links	we stared at each other in blank amazement . 15 a photograph the doctor ’ s words were so surprising that we were all momentarily taken aback . here was a man stabbed with a dagger which we knew to have been stolen only twenty-four hours previously , and yet dr. durand asserted positively that he had been dead at least forty-eight hours ! the whole thing was fantastic to the last extreme .
christie	links	we were still recovering from the surprise of the doctor ’ s announcement , when a telegram was brought to me . it had been sent up from the hotel to the villa . i tore it open . it was from poirot , and announced his return by the train arriving at merlinville at 12:28 .
christie	links	i looked at my watch and saw that i had just time to get comfortably to the station and meet him there . i felt that it was of the utmost importance that he should know at once of the new and startling developments in the case .
christie	links	evidently , i reflected , poirot had had no difficulty in finding what he wanted in paris . the quickness of his return proved that . very few hours had sufficed . i wondered how he would take the exciting news i had to impart .
christie	links	the train was some minutes late , and i strolled aimlessly up and down the platform , until it occurred to me that i might pass the time by asking a few questions as to who had left merlinville by the last train on the evening of the tragedy .
christie	links	i approached the chief porter , an intelligent looking man , and had little difficulty in persuading him to enter upon the subject . it was a disgrace to the police , he hotly affirmed , that such brigands of assassins should be allowed to go about unpunished . i hinted that there was some possibility they might have left by the midnight train , but he negatived the idea decidedly . he would have noticed two foreigners—he was sure of it . only about twenty people had left by the train , and he could not have failed to observe them .
christie	links	i do not know what put the idea into my head—possibly it was the deep anxiety underlying marthe daubreuil ’ s tones—but i asked suddenly : “ young m. renauld—he did not leave by that train , did he ? ”
christie	links	“ ah , no , monsieur . to arrive and start off again within half an hour , it would not be amusing , that ! ” i stared at the man , the significance of his words almost escaping me . then i saw.…
christie	links	“ you mean , ” i said , my heart beating a little , “ that m. jack renauld arrived at merlinville that evening ? ” “ but yes , monsieur . by the last train arriving the other way , the 11:40 . ”
christie	links	my brain whirled . that , then , was the reason of marthe ’ s poignant anxiety . jack renauld had been in merlinville on the night of the crime ! but why had he not said so ? why , on the contrary , had he led us to believe that he had remained in cherbourg ? remembering his frank boyish countenance , i could hardly bring myself to believe that he had any connection with the crime . yet why this silence on his part about so vital a matter ? one thing was certain , marthe had known all along . hence her anxiety , and her eager questioning of poirot to know whether any one were suspected .
christie	links	my cogitations were interrupted by the arrival of the train , and in another moment i was greeting poirot . the little man was radiant . he beamed and vociferated and , forgetting my english reluctance , embraced me warmly on the platform .
christie	links	“ _mon cher ami___ , i have succeeded—but succeeded to a marvel ! ” “ indeed ? i ’ m delighted to hear it . have you heard the latest here ? ” “ how would you that i should hear anything ? there have been some developments , eh ? the brave giraud , he has made an arrest ? or even arrests perhaps ? ah , but i will make him look foolish , that one ! but where are you taking me , my friend ? do we not go to the hotel ? it is necessary that i attend to my moustaches—they are deplorably limp from the heat of travelling . also , without doubt , there is dust on my coat . and my tie , that i must rearrange . ”
christie	links	i cut short his remonstrances . “ my dear poirot—never mind all that . we must go to the villa at once . _there has been another murder ! ___ ” i have frequently been disappointed when fancying that i was giving news of importance to my friend . either he has known it already or he has dismissed it as irrelevant to the main issue—and in the latter case events have usually proved him justified . but this time i could not complain of missing my effect . never have i seen a man so flabbergasted . his jaw dropped . all the jauntiness went out of his bearing . he stared at me open-mouthed .
christie	links	“ what is that you say ? another murder ? ah , then , i am all wrong . i have failed . giraud may mock himself at me—he will have reason ! ” “ you did not expect it , then ? ”
christie	links	“ i ? not the least in the world . it demolishes my theory—it ruins everything—it—ah , no ! ” he stopped dead , thumping himself on the chest . “ it is impossible . i _cannot___ be wrong ! the facts , taken methodically and in their proper order admit of only one explanation . i must be right ! i _am___ right ! ”
christie	links	“ but then— ” he interrupted me . “ wait , my friend . i must be right , therefore this new murder is impossible unless—unless—oh , wait , i implore you . say no word— ” he was silent for a moment or two , then , resuming his normal manner , he said in a quiet assured voice : “ the victim is a man of middle-age . his body was found in the locked shed near the scene of the crime and had been dead at least forty-eight hours . and it is most probable that he was stabbed in a similar manner to m. renauld , though not necessarily in the back . ”
christie	links	it was my turn to gape—and gape i did . in all my knowledge of poirot he had never done anything so amazing as this . and , almost inevitably , a doubt crossed my mind .
christie	links	“ poirot , ” i cried , “ you ’ re pulling my leg . you ’ ve heard all about it already. ” he turned his earnest gaze upon me reproachfully . “ would i do such a thing ? i assure you that i have heard nothing whatsoever . did you not observe the shock your news was to me ? ”
christie	links	“ but how on earth could you know all that ? ” “ i was right then ? but i knew it . the little grey cells , my friend , the little grey cells ! they told me . thus , and in no other way , could there have been a second death . now tell me all . if we go round to the left here , we can take a short cut across the golf links which will bring us to the back of the villa geneviève much more quickly . ”
christie	links	as we walked , taking the way he had indicated , i recounted all i knew . poirot listened attentively . “ the dagger was in the wound , you say ? that is curious . you are sure it was the same one ? ”
christie	links	“ absolutely certain . that ’ s what make it so impossible. ” “ nothing is impossible . there may have been two daggers. ” i raised my eyebrows . “ surely that is in the highest degree unlikely ? it would be a most extraordinary coincidence . ”
christie	links	“ you speak as usual , without reflection , hastings . in some cases two identical weapons _would___ be highly improbable . but not here . this particular weapon was a war souvenir which was made to jack renauld ’ s orders . it is really highly unlikely , when you come to think of it , that he should have had only one made . very probably he would have another for his own use . ”
christie	links	“ but nobody has mentioned such a thing , ” i objected . a hint of the lecturer crept into poirot ’ s tone . “ my friend , in working upon a case , one does not take into account only the things that are ‘ mentioned. ’ there is no reason to mention many things which may be important . equally , there is often an excellent reason for _not___ mentioning them . you can take your choice of the two motives . ”
christie	links	i was silent , impressed in spite of myself . another few minutes brought us to the famous shed . we found all our friends there and , after an interchange of polite amenities , poirot began his task .
christie	links	having watched giraud at work , i was keenly interested . poirot bestowed but a cursory glance on the surroundings . the only thing he examined was the ragged coat and trousers by the door . a disdainful smile rose to giraud ’ s lips , and , as though noting it , poirot flung the bundle down again .
christie	links	“ old clothes of the gardener ’ s ? ” he queried . “ exactly , ” said giraud . poirot knelt down by the body . his fingers were rapid but methodical . he examined the texture of the clothes , and satisfied himself that there were no marks on them . the boots he subjected to special care , also the dirty and broken finger-nails . whilst examining the latter he threw a quick question at giraud .
christie	links	“ you saw these ? ” “ yes , i saw them , ” replied the other . his face remained inscrutable . suddenly poirot stiffened . “ dr . durand ! ” “ yes ? ” the doctor came forward . “ there is foam on the lips . you observed it ? ”
christie	links	“ i didn ’ t notice it , i must admit. ” “ but you observe it now ? ” “ oh , certainly. ” poirot again shot a question at giraud . “ you noticed it without doubt ? ” the other did not reply . poirot proceeded . the dagger had been withdrawn from the wound . it reposed in a glass jar by the side of the body . poirot examined it , then he studied the wound closely . when he looked up , his eyes were excited , and shone with the green light i knew so well .
christie	links	“ it is a strange wound , this ! it has not bled . there is no stain on the clothes . the blade of the dagger is slightly discoloured , that is all . what do you think , m. le docteur ? ”
christie	links	“ i can only say that it is most abnormal. ” “ it is not abnormal at all . it is most simple . the man was stabbed _after he was dead___. ” and , stilling the clamour of voices that arose with a wave of his hand , poirot turned to giraud and added , “ m . giraud agrees with me , do you not , monsieur ? ”
christie	links	whatever giraud ’ s real belief , he accepted the position without moving a muscle . calmly and almost scornfully he replied : “ certainly i agree. ” the murmur of surprise and interest broke out again .
christie	links	“ but what an idea ! ” cried m. hautet . “ to stab a man after he is dead ! barbaric ! unheard of ! some unappeasable hate , perhaps. ” “ no , m. le juge , ” said poirot . “ i should fancy it was done quite cold-bloodedly—to create an impression . ”
christie	links	“ what impression ? ” “ the impression it nearly did create , ” returned poirot oracularly . m. bex had been thinking . “ how , then , was the man killed ? ” “ he was not killed . he died . he died , m. le juge , if i am not much mistaken , of an epileptic fit ! ”
christie	links	this statement of poirot ’ s again aroused considerable excitement . dr. durand knelt down again , and made a searching examination . at last he rose to his feet . “ well , m. le docteur ? ” “ m . poirot , i am inclined to believe that you are correct in your assertion . i was misled to begin with . the incontrovertible fact that the man had been stabbed distracted my attention from any other indications . ”
christie	links	poirot was the hero of the hour . the examining magistrate was profuse in compliments . poirot responded gracefully , and then excused himself on the pretext that neither he nor i had yet lunched , and that he wished to repair the ravages of the journey . as we were about to leave the shed , giraud approached us .
christie	links	“ one more thing , m. poirot , ” he said , in his suave mocking voice . “ we found this coiled round the handle of the dagger . a woman ’ s hair. ” “ ah ! ” said poirot . “ a woman ’ s hair ? what woman ’ s , i wonder ? ”
christie	links	“ i wonder also , ” said giraud . then , with a bow , he left us . “ he was insistent , the good giraud , ” said poirot thoughtfully , as we walked towards the hotel . “ i wonder in what direction he hopes to mislead me ? a woman ’ s hair—h ’ m ! ”
christie	links	we lunched heartily , but i found poirot somewhat distrait and inattentive . afterwards we went up to our sitting-room and there i begged him to tell me something of his mysterious journey to paris .
christie	links	“ willingly , my friend . i went to paris to find _this___. ” he took from his pocket a small faded newspaper cutting . it was the reproduction of a woman ’ s photograph . he handed it to me . i uttered an exclamation .
christie	links	“ you recognize it , my friend ? ” i nodded . although the photo obviously dated from very many years back , and the hair was dressed in a different style , the likeness was unmistakable .
christie	links	“ madame daubreuil ! ” i exclaimed . poirot shook his head with a smile . “ not quite correct , my friend . she did not call herself by that name in those days . that is a picture of the notorious madame beroldy ! ”
christie	links	madame beroldy ! in a flash the whole thing came back to me . the murder trial that had evoked such world-wide interest . _the beroldy case.___ 16 the beroldy case some twenty years or so before the opening of the present story , monsieur arnold beroldy , a native of lyons , arrived in paris accompanied by his pretty wife and their little daughter , a mere babe . monsieur beroldy was a junior partner in a firm of wine merchants , a stout middle-aged man , fond of the good things of life , devoted to his charming wife , and altogether unremarkable in every way . the firm in which monsieur beroldy was a partner was a small one , and although doing well , it did not yield a large income to the junior partner . the beroldys had a small apartment and lived in a very modest fashion to begin with .
christie	links	but unremarkable though monsieur beroldy might be , his wife was plentifully gilded with the brush of romance . young and good looking , and gifted withal with a singular charm of manner , madame beroldy at once created a stir in the quarter , especially when it began to be whispered that some interesting mystery surrounded her birth . it was rumoured that she was the illegitimate daughter of a russian grand duke . others asserted that it was an austrian archduke , and that the union was legal , though morganatic . but all stories agreed upon one point , that jeanne beroldy was the centre of an interesting mystery . questioned by the curious , madame beroldy did not deny these rumours . on the other hand she let it be clearly understood that , though her “ lips ” were “ sealed , ” all these stories had a foundation in fact . to intimate friends she unburdened herself further , spoke of political intrigues , of “ papers , ” of obscure dangers that threatened her . there was also much talk of crown jewels that were to be sold secretly , with herself acting as the go-between .
christie	links	amongst the friends and acquaintances of the beroldys was a young lawyer , georges conneau . it was soon evident that the fascinating jeanne had completely enslaved his heart . madame beroldy encouraged the young man in a discreet fashion , but being always careful to affirm her complete devotion to her middle-aged husband . nevertheless , many spiteful persons did not hesitate to declare that young conneau was her lover—and not the only one !
christie	links	when the beroldys had been in paris about three months , another personage came upon the scene . this was mr. hiram p. trapp , a native of the united states , and extremely wealthy . introduced to the charming and mysterious madame beroldy , he fell a prompt victim to her fascinations . his admiration was obvious , though strictly respectful .
christie	links	about this time , madame beroldy became more outspoken in her confidences . to several friends , she declared herself greatly worried on her husband ’ s behalf . she explained that he had been drawn into several schemes of a political nature , and also referred to some important papers that had been entrusted to him for safekeeping and which concerned a “ secret ” of far reaching european importance . they had been entrusted to his custody to throw pursuers off the track , but madame beroldy was nervous , having recognized several important members of the revolutionary circle in paris .
christie	links	on the 28th day of november , the blow fell . the woman who came daily to clean and cook for the beroldys was surprised to find the door of the apartment standing wide open . hearing faint moans issuing from the bedroom , she went in . a terrible sight met her eyes . madame beroldy lay on the floor , bound hand and foot , uttering feeble moans , having managed to free her mouth from a gag . on the bed was monsieur beroldy , lying in a pool of blood , with a knife driven through his heart .
christie	links	madame beroldy ’ s story was clear enough . suddenly awakened from sleep , she had discerned two masked men bending over her . stifling her cries , they had bound and gagged her . they had then demanded of monsieur beroldy the famous “ secret . ”
christie	links	but the intrepid wine merchant refused point-blank to accede to their request . angered by his refusal , one of the men incontinently stabbed him through the heart . with the dead man ’ s keys , they had opened the safe in the corner , and had carried away with them a mass of papers . both men were heavily bearded , and had worn masks , but madame beroldy declared positively that they were russians .
christie	links	the affair created an immense sensation . it was referred to variously as “ the nihilist atrocity , ” “ revolutionaries in paris , ” and the “ russian mystery. ” time went on , and the mysterious bearded men were never traced . and then , just as public interest was beginning to die down , a startling development occurred . madame beroldy was arrested and charged with the murder of her husband .
christie	links	the trial , when it came on , aroused widespread interest . the youth and beauty of the accused , and her mysterious history , were sufficient to make of it a _cause célèbre___ . people ranged themselves wildly for or against the prisoner . but her partisans received several severe checks to their enthusiasm . the romantic past of madame beroldy , her royal blood , and the mysterious intrigues in which she had her being were shown to be mere fantasies of the imagination .
christie	links	it was proved beyond doubt that jeanne beroldy ’ s parents were a highly respectable and prosaic couple , fruit merchants , who lived on the outskirts of lyons . the russian grand duke , the court intrigues , and the political schemes—all the stories current were traced back to—the lady herself ! from her brain had emanated these ingenious myths , and she was proved to have raised a considerable sum of money from various credulous persons by her fiction of the “ crown jewels ” —the jewels in question being found to be mere paste imitations . remorselessly the whole story of her life was laid bare . the motive for the murder was found in mr. hiram p. trapp . mr. trapp did his best , but relentlessly and agilely cross-questioned he was forced to admit that he loved the lady , and that , had she been free , he would have asked her to be his wife . the fact that the relations between them were admittedly platonic strengthened the case against the accused . debarred from becoming his mistress by the simple honourable nature of the man , jeanne beroldy had conceived the monstrous project of ridding herself of her elderly undistinguished husband , and becoming the wife of the rich american .
christie	links	throughout , madame beroldy confronted her accusers with complete sang froid and self possession . her story never varied . she continued to declare strenuously that she was of royal birth , and that she had been substituted for the daughter of the fruit seller at an early age . absurd and completely unsubstantiated as these statements were , a great number of people believed implicitly in their truth .
christie	links	but the prosecution was implacable . it denounced the masked “ russians ” as a myth , and asserted that the crime had been committed by madame beroldy and her lover , georges conneau . a warrant was issued for the arrest of the latter , but he had wisely disappeared . evidence showed that the bonds which secured madame beroldy were so loose that she could easily have freed herself .
christie	links	and then , towards the close of the trial , a letter , posted in paris , was sent to the public prosecutor . it was from georges conneau and , without revealing his whereabouts , it contained a full confession of the crime . he declared that he had indeed struck the fatal blow at madame beroldy ’ s instigation . the crime had been planned between them . believing that her husband ill-treated her , and maddened by his own passion for her , a passion which he believed her to return , he had planned the crime and struck the fatal blow that should free the woman he loved from a hateful bondage . now , for the first time , he learnt of mr. hiram p. trapp , and realized that the woman he loved had betrayed him ! not for his sake did she wish to be free—but in order to marry the wealthy american . she had used him as a cat ’ s-paw , and now , in his jealous rage , he turned and denounced her , declaring that throughout he had acted at her instigation .
christie	links	and then madame beroldy proved herself the remarkable woman she undoubtedly was . without hesitation , she dropped her previous defence , and admitted that the “ russians ” were a pure invention on her part . the real murderer was georges conneau . maddened by passion , he had committed the crime , vowing that if she did not keep silence he would enact a terrible vengeance from her . terrified by his threats , she had consented—also fearing it likely that if she told the truth she might be accused of conniving at the crime . but she had steadfastly refused to have anything more to do with her husband ’ s murderer , and it was in revenge for this attitude on her part that he had written this letter accusing her . she swore solemnly that she had had nothing to do with the planning of the crime , that she had awoke on that memorable night to find georges conneau standing over her , the blood-stained knife in his hand .
christie	links	it was a touch and go affair . madame beroldy ’ s story was hardly credible . but this woman , whose fairy tales of royal intrigues had been so easily accepted , had the supreme art of making herself believed . her address to the jury was a masterpiece . the tears streaming down her face , she spoke of her child , of her woman ’ s honour—of her desire to keep her reputation untarnished for the child ’ s sake . she admitted that , georges conneau having been her lover , she might perhaps be held morally responsible for the crime—but , before god , nothing more ! she knew that she had committed a grave fault in not denouncing conneau to the law , but she declared in a broken voice that that was a thing no woman could have done.… she had loved him ! could she let her hand be the one to send him to the guillotine ? she had been guilty of much , but she was innocent of the terrible crime imputed to her .
christie	links	however that may have been , her eloquence and personality won the day . madame beroldy , amidst a scene of unparalleled excitement , was acquitted . despite the utmost endeavours of the police , georges conneau was never traced . as for madame beroldy , nothing more was heard of her . taking the child with her , she left paris to begin a new life .
christie	links	17 we make further investigations i have set down the beroldy case in full . of course all the details did not present themselves to my memory as i have recounted them here . nevertheless , i recalled the case fairly accurately . it had attracted a great deal of interest at the time , and had been fully reported by the english papers , so that it did not need much effort of memory on my part to recollect the salient details .
christie	links	just for the moment , in my excitement , it seemed to clear up the whole matter . i admit that i am impulsive , and poirot deplores my custom of jumping to conclusions , but i think i had some excuse in this instance . the remarkable way in which this discovery justified poirot ’ s point of view struck me at once .
christie	links	“ poirot , ” i said , “ i congratulate you . i see everything now. ” “ if that is indeed the truth , _i___ congratulate _you___ , _mon ami___ . for as a rule you are not famous for seeing—eh , is it not so ? ”
christie	links	i felt a little annoyed . “ come now , don ’ t rub it in . you ’ ve been so confoundedly mysterious all along with your hints and your insignificant details that any one might fail to see what you were driving at . ”
christie	links	poirot lit one of his little cigarettes with his usual precision . then he looked up . “ and since you see everything now , _mon ami___ , what exactly is it that you see ? ”
christie	links	“ why , that it was madame daubreuil—beroldy , who murdered mr. renauld . the similarity of the two cases proves that beyond a doubt. ” “ then you consider that madame beroldy was wrongly acquitted ? that in actual fact she was guilty of connivance in her husband ’ s murder ? ”
christie	links	i opened my eyes wide . “ but of course ! don ’ t you ? ” poirot walked to the end of the room , absentmindedly straightened a chair , and then said thoughtfully . “ yes , that is my opinion . but there is no ‘ of course ’ about it , my friend . technically speaking , madame beroldy is innocent . ”
christie	links	“ of that crime , perhaps . but not of this. ” poirot sat down again , and regarded me , his thoughtful air more marked than ever . “ so it is definitely your opinion , hastings , that madame daubreuil murdered m. renauld ? ”
christie	links	“ yes. ” “ why ? ” he shot the question at me with such suddenness that i was taken aback . “ why ? ” i stammered . “ why ? oh , because— ” i came to a stop . poirot nodded his head at me .
christie	links	“ you see , you come to a stumbling-block at once . why should madame daubreuil ( i shall call her that for clearness sake ) murder m. renauld ? we can find no shadow of a motive . she does not benefit by his death ; considered as either mistress or blackmailer she stands to lose . you can not have a murder without a motive . the first crime was different , there we had a rich lover waiting to step into her husband ’ s shoes . ”
christie	links	“ money is not the only motive for murder , ” i objected . “ true , ” agreed poirot placidly . “ there are two others , the _crime passionnel___ is one . and there is the third rare motive , murder for an idea which implies some form of mental derangement on the part of the murderer . homicidal mania , and religious fanaticism belong to that class . we can rule it out here . ”
christie	links	“ but what about the _crime passionnel ? ___ can you rule that out ? if madame daubreuil was renauld ’ s mistress , if she found that his affection was cooling , or if her jealousy was aroused in any way , might she not have struck him down in a moment of anger ? ”
christie	links	poirot shook his head . “ if—i say _if___ , you note—madame daubreuil was renauld ’ s mistress , he had not had time to tire of her . and in any case you mistake her character . she is a woman who can simulate great emotional stress . she is a magnificent actress . but , looked at dispassionately , her life disproves her appearance . throughout , if we examine it , she had been cold-blooded and calculating in her motives and actions . it was not to link her life with that of her young lover that she connived at her husband ’ s murder . the rich american , for whom she probably did not care a button , was her objective . if she committed a crime , she would always do so for gain . here there was no gain . besides , how do you account for the digging of the grave ? that was a man ’ s work . ”
christie	links	“ she might have had an accomplice , ” i suggested , unwilling to relinquish my belief . “ i pass to another objection . you have spoken of the similarity between the two crimes . wherein does that lie , my friend ? ”
christie	links	i stared at him in astonishment . “ why , poirot , it was you who remarked on that ! the story of the masked men , the ‘ secret , ’ the papers ! ” poirot smiled a little . “ do not be so indignant , i beg of you . i repudiate nothing . the similarity of the two stories links the two cases together inevitably . but reflect now on something very curious . it is not madame daubreuil who tells us this tale—if it were all would indeed be plain sailing—it is madame renauld . is she then in league with the other ? ”
christie	links	“ i can ’ t believe that , ” i said slowly . “ if it is so , she must be the most consummate actress the world has ever known. ” “ ta-ta-ta , ” said poirot impatiently . “ again you have the sentiment , and not the logic ! if it is necessary for a criminal to be a consummate actress , then by all means assume her to be one . but is it necessary ? i do not believe madame renauld to be in league with madame daubreuil for several reasons , some of which i have already enumerated to you . the others are self-evident . therefore , that possibility eliminated , we draw very near to the truth which is , as always , very curious and interesting . ”
christie	links	“ poirot , ” i cried , “ what more do you know ? ” “ _mon ami___ , you must make your own deductions . you have ‘ access to the facts ! ’ concentrate your grey cells . reason—not like giraud—but like hercule poirot . ”
christie	links	“ but are you _sure ? ___ ” “ my friend , in many ways i have been an imbecile . but at last i see clearly. ” “ you know everything ? ” “ i have discovered what m. renauld sent for me to discover . ”
christie	links	“ and you know the murderer ? ” “ i know one murderer. ” “ what do you mean ? ” “ we talk a little at cross-purposes . there are here not one crime , but two . the first i have solved , the second—_eh bien___ , i will confess , i am not sure ! ”
christie	links	“ but , poirot , i thought you said the man in the shed had died a natural death ? ” “ ta-ta-ta. ” poirot made his favourite ejaculation of impatience . “ still you do not understand . one may have a crime without a murderer , but for two crimes it is essential to have two bodies . ”
christie	links	his remark struck me as so peculiarly lacking in lucidity that i looked at him in some anxiety . but he appeared perfectly normal . suddenly he rose and strolled to the window .
christie	links	“ here he is , ” he observed . “ who ? ” “ m . jack renauld . i sent a note up to the villa to ask him to come here. ” that changed the course of my ideas , and i asked poirot if he knew that jack renauld had been in merlinville on the night of the crime . i had hoped to catch my astute little friend napping , but as usual , he was omniscient . he , too , had inquired at the station .
christie	links	“ and without doubt we are not original in the idea , hastings . the excellent giraud , he also has probably made his inquiries. ” “ you don ’ t think— ” i said , and then stopped . “ ah , no , it would be too horrible ! ”
christie	links	poirot looked inquiringly at me , but i said no more . it had just occurred to me that though there were seven women directly or indirectly connected with the case mrs. renauld , madame daubreuil and her daughter , the mysterious visitor , and the three servants—there was , with the exception of old auguste who could hardly count , only one man—jack renauld . _and a man must have dug a grave.…___
christie	links	i had no time to develop further the appalling idea that had occurred to me , for jack renauld was ushered into the room . poirot greeted him in a business-like manner .
christie	links	“ take a seat , monsieur . i regret infinitely to derange you , but you will perhaps understand that the atmosphere of the villa is not too congenial to me . m. giraud and i do not see eye to eye about everything . his politeness to me has not been striking and you will comprehend that i do not intend any little discoveries i may make to benefit him in any way . ”
christie	links	“ exactly , m. poirot , ” said the lad . “ that fellow giraud is an ill-conditioned brute , and i ’ d be delighted to see some one score at his expense. ” “ then i may ask a little favour of you ? ”
christie	links	“ certainly. ” “ i will ask you to go to the railway station and take a train to the next station along the line , abbalac . ask there at the cloak-room whether two foreigners deposited a valise there on the night of the murder . it is a small station , and they are almost certain to remember . will you do this ? ”
christie	links	“ of course i will , ” said the boy , mystified , though ready for the task . “ i and my friend , you comprehend , have business elsewhere , ” explained poirot . “ there is a train in a quarter of an hour , and i will ask you not to return to the villa , as i have no wish for giraud to get an inkling of your errand . ”
christie	links	“ very well , i will go straight to the station. ” he rose to his feet . poirot ’ s voice stopped him . “ one moment , m. renauld , there is one little matter that puzzles me . why did you not mention to m. hautet this morning that you were in merlinville on the night of the crime ? ”
christie	links	jack renauld ’ s face went crimson . with an effort he controlled himself . “ you have made a mistake . i was in cherbourg , as i told the examining magistrate this morning. ” poirot looked at him , his eyes narrowed , cat-like , until they only showed a gleam of green .
christie	links	“ then it is a singular mistake that i have made there—for it is shared by the station staff . they say you arrived by the 11:40 train. ” for a moment jack renauld hesitated , then he made up his mind .
christie	links	“ and if i did ? i suppose you do not mean to accuse me of participating in my father ’ s murder ? ” he asked the question haughtily , his head thrown back . “ i should like an explanation of the reason that brought you here . ”
christie	links	“ that is simple enough . i came to see my fiancée , mademoiselle daubreuil . i was on the eve of a long voyage , uncertain as to when i should return . i wished to see her before i went , to assure her of my unchanging devotion . ”
christie	links	“ and you did see her ? ” poirot ’ s eyes never left the other ’ s face . there was an appreciable pause before renauld replied . then he said : “ yes. ” “ and afterwards ? ” “ i found i had missed the last train . i walked to st. beauvais where i knocked up a garage and got a car to take me back to cherbourg . ”
christie	links	“ st . beauvais ? that is fifteen kilometres . a long walk , m. renauld. ” “ i—i felt like walking. ” poirot bowed his head as a sign that he accepted the explanation . jack renauld took up his hat and cane and departed . in a trice poirot jumped to his feet .
christie	links	“ quick , hastings . we will go after him. ” keeping a discreet distance behind our quarry , we followed him through the streets of merlinville . but when poirot saw that he took the turning to the station , he checked himself .
christie	links	“ all is well . he has taken the bait . he will go to abbalac , and will inquire for the mythical valise left by the mythical foreigners . yes , _mon ami___ , all that was a little invention of my own . ”
christie	links	“ you wanted him out of the way ! ” i exclaimed . “ your penetration is amazing , hastings ! now , if you please , we will go up to the villa geneviève. ” 18 giraud acts “ by the way , poirot , ” i said , as we walked along the hot white road , “ i ’ ve got a bone to pick with you . i dare say you meant well , but really it was no business of yours to go mouching round to the hôtel du phare without letting me know . ”
christie	links	poirot shot a quick sidelong glance at me . “ and how did you know i had been there ? ” he inquired . much to my annoyance i felt the colour rising in my cheeks .
christie	links	“ i happened to look in in passing , ” i explained with as much dignity as i could muster . i rather feared poirot ’ s banter , but to my relief , and somewhat to my surprise , he only shook his head with a rather unusual gravity .
christie	links	“ if i have offended your susceptibilities in any way , i demand pardon of you . you will understand better soon . but , believe me , i have striven to concentrate all my energies on the case . ”
christie	links	“ oh , it ’ s all right , ” i said , mollified by the apology . “ i know it ’ s only that you have my interests at heart . but i can take care of myself all right . ”
christie	links	poirot seemed to be about to say something further , but checked himself . arrived at the villa , poirot led the way up to the shed where the second body had been discovered . he did not , however , go in , but paused by the bench which i have mentioned before as being set some few yards away from it . after contemplating it for a moment or two , he paced carefully from it to the hedge which marked the boundary between the villa geneviève and the villa marguerite . then he paced back again , nodding his head as he did so . returning again to the hedge , he parted the bushes with his hands .
christie	links	“ with good fortune , ” he remarked to me over his shoulder , “ mademoiselle marthe may find herself in the garden . i desire to speak to her and would prefer not to call formally at the villa marguerite . ah , all is well , there she is . pst , mademoiselle ! pst ! _un moment , s ’ il vous plaît.___ ”
christie	links	i joined him at the moment that marthe daubreuil , looking slightly startled , came running up to the hedge at his call . “ a little word with you , mademoiselle , if it is permitted ? ”
christie	links	“ certainly , monsieur poirot. ” despite her acquiescence , her eyes looked troubled and afraid . “ mademoiselle , do you remember running after me on the road the day that i came to your house with the examining magistrate ? you asked me if any one were suspected of the crime . ”
christie	links	“ and you told me two chilians. ” her voice sounded rather breathless , and her left hand stole to her breast . “ will you ask me the same question again , mademoiselle ? ” “ what do you mean ? ”
christie	links	“ this . if you were to ask me that question again , i should give you a different answer . some one is suspected—but not a chilian. ” “ who ? ” the word came faintly between her parted lips .
christie	links	“ m . jack renauld. ” “ what ? ” it was a cry . “ jack ? impossible . who dares to suspect him ? ” “ giraud. ” “ giraud ! ” the girl ’ s face was ashy . “ i am afraid of that man . he is cruel . he will—he will— ” she broke off . there was courage gathering in her face , and determination . i realized in that moment that she was a fighter . poirot , too , watched her intently .
christie	links	“ you know , of course , that he was here on the night of the murder ? ” he asked . “ yes , ” she replied mechanically . “ he told me. ” “ it was unwise to have tried to conceal the fact , ” ventured poirot .
christie	links	“ yes , yes , ” she replied impatiently . “ but we can not waste time on regrets . we must find something to save him . he is innocent , of course , but that will not help him with a man like giraud who has his reputation to think of . he must arrest some one , and that some one will be jack . ”
christie	links	“ the facts will tell against him , ” said poirot . “ you realize that ? ” she faced him squarely , and used the words i had heard her say in her mother ’ s drawing-room . “ i am not a child , monsieur . i can be brave and look facts in the face . he is innocent , and we must save him . ”
christie	links	she spoke with a kind of desperate energy , then was silent , frowning as she thought . “ mademoiselle , ” said poirot observing her keenly , “ is there not something that you are keeping back that you could tell us ? ”
christie	links	she nodded perplexedly . “ yes , there is something , but i hardly know whether you will believe it—it seems so absurd. ” “ at any rate , tell us , mademoiselle. ” “ it is this . m. giraud sent for me , as an afterthought , to see if i could identify the man in there. ” she signed with her head towards the shed . “ i could not . at least i could not at the moment . but since i have been thinking— ”
christie	links	“ well ? ” “ it seems so queer , and yet i am almost sure . i will tell you . on the morning of the day m. renauld was murdered , i was walking in the garden here , when i heard a sound of men ’ s voices quarrelling . i pushed aside the bushes and looked through . one of the men was m. renauld and the other was a tramp , a dreadful looking creature in filthy rags . he was alternately whining and threatening . i gathered he was asking for money , but at that moment _maman___ called me from the house , and i had to go . that is all , only—i am almost sure that the tramp and the dead man in the shed are one and the same . ”
christie	links	poirot uttered an exclamation . “ but why did you not say so at the time , mademoiselle ? ” “ because at first it only struck me that the face was vaguely familiar in some way . the man was differently dressed , and apparently belonged to a superior station in life . but tell me , monsieur poirot , is it not possible that this tramp might have attacked and killed m. renauld , and taken his clothes and money ? ”
christie	links	“ it is an idea , mademoiselle , ” said poirot slowly . “ it leaves a lot unexplained , but it is certainly an idea . i will think of it. ” a voice called from the house .
christie	links	“ _maman___ , ” whispered marthe , “ i must go. ” and she slipped away through the trees . “ come , ” said poirot , and taking my arm , turned in the direction of the villa . “ what do you really think ? ” i asked , in some curiosity . “ was that story true , or did the girl make it up in order to divert suspicion from her lover ? ”
christie	links	“ it is a curious tale , ” said poirot , “ but i believe it to be the absolute truth . unwittingly , mademoiselle marthe told us the truth on another point—and incidentally gave jack renauld the lie . did you notice his hesitation when i asked him if he saw marthe daubreuil on the night of the crime ? he paused and then said ‘ yes. ’ i suspected that he was lying . it was necessary for me to see mademoiselle marthe before he could put her on her guard . three little words gave me the information i wanted . when i asked her if she knew that jack renauld was here that night , she answered ‘ he _told___ me. ’ now , hastings , what was jack renauld doing here on that eventful evening , and if he did not see mademoiselle marthe whom did he see ? ”
christie	links	“ surely , poirot , ” i cried , aghast , “ you can not believe that a boy like that would murder his own father. ” “ _mon ami___ , ” said poirot , “ you continue to be of a sentimentality unbelievable ! i have seen mothers who murdered their little children for the sake of the insurance money ! after that , one can believe anything . ”
christie	links	“ and the motive ? ” “ money of course . remember that jack renauld thought that he would come in to half his father ’ s fortune at the latter ’ s death. ” “ but the tramp . where does he come in ? ”
christie	links	poirot shrugged his shoulders . “ giraud would say that he was an accomplice—an apache who helped young renauld to commit the crime , and who was conveniently put out of the way afterwards . ”
christie	links	“ but the hair round the dagger ? the woman ’ s hair ? ” “ ah , ” said poirot , smiling broadly . “ that is the cream of giraud ’ s little jest . according to him , it is not a woman ’ s hair at all . remember that the youths of today wear their hair brushed straight back from the forehead with pomade or hairwash to make it lie flat . consequently some of the hairs are of considerable length . ”
christie	links	“ and you believe that too ? ” “ no , ” said poirot with a curious smile . “ for i know it to be the hair of a woman—and more , which woman ! ” “ madame daubreuil , ” i announced positively .
christie	links	“ perhaps , ” said poirot , regarding me quizzically . but i refused to allow myself to get annoyed . “ what are we going to do now ? ” i asked , as we entered the hall of the villa geneviève .
christie	links	“ i wish to make a search amongst the effects of m. jack renauld . that is why i had to get him out of the way for a few hours. ” “ but will not giraud have searched already ? ” i asked doubtfully .
christie	links	“ of course . he builds a case , as a beaver builds a dam , with a fatiguing industry . but he will not have looked for the things that i am seeking—in all probability he would not have seen their importance if they stared him in the face . let us begin . ”
christie	links	neatly and methodically , poirot opened each drawer in turn , examined the contents , and returned them exactly to their places . it was a singularly dull and uninteresting proceeding . poirot waded on through collars , pajamas and socks . a purring noise outside drew me to the window . instantly i became galvanized into life .
christie	links	“ poirot ! ” i cried . “ a car has just driven up . giraud is in it , and jack renauld , and two gendarmes. ” “ _sacré tonnerre ! ___ ” growled poirot . “ that animal of a giraud , could he not wait ? i shall not be able to replace the things in this last drawer with the proper method . let us be quick . ”
christie	links	unceremoniously he tumbled out the things on the floor , mostly ties and handkerchiefs . suddenly with a cry of triumph poirot pounced on something , a small square cardboard , evidently a photograph . thrusting it into his pocket , he returned the things pell-mell to the drawer , and seizing me by the arm dragged me out of the room and down the stairs . in the hall stood giraud , contemplating his prisoner .
christie	links	“ good afternoon , m. giraud , ” said poirot . “ what have we here ? ” giraud nodded his head towards jack . “ he was trying to make a getaway , but i was too sharp for him . he is under arrest for the murder of his father , m. paul renauld . ”
christie	links	poirot wheeled to confront the boy who leaned limply against the door , his face ashy pale . “ what do you say to that , _jeune homme ? ___ ” jack renauld stared at him stonily .
christie	links	“ nothing , ” he said . 19 i use my grey cells i was dumbfounded . up to the last , i had not been able bring myself to believe jack renauld guilty . i had expected a ringing proclamation of his innocence when poirot challenged him . but now , watching him as he stood , white and limp against the wall , and hearing the damning admission fall from his lips , i doubted no longer .
christie	links	but poirot had turned to giraud . “ what are your grounds for arresting him ? ” “ do you expect me to give them to you ? ” “ as a matter of courtesy , yes. ” giraud looked at him doubtfully . he was torn between a desire to refuse rudely and the pleasure of triumphing over his adversary .
christie	links	“ you think i have made a mistake , i suppose ? ” he sneered . “ it would not surprise me , ” replied poirot , with a soupçon of malice . giraud ’ s face took on a deeper tinge of red .
christie	links	“ _eh bien___ , come in here . you shall judge for yourself. ” he flung open the door of the _salon___ , and we passed in , leaving jack renauld in the care of the two other men .
christie	links	“ now , m. poirot , ” said giraud laying his hat on the table , and speaking with the utmost sarcasm , “ i will treat you to a little lecture on detective work . i will show you how we moderns work . ”
christie	links	“ _bien ! ___ ” said poirot , composing himself to listen . “ i will show you how admirably the old guard can listen , ” and he leaned back and closed his eyes , opening them for a moment to remark . “ do not fear that i shall sleep . i will attend most carefully . ”
christie	links	“ of course , ” began giraud , “ i soon saw through all that chilian tomfoolery . two men were in it—but they were not mysterious foreigners ! all that was a blind. ” “ very creditable so far , my dear giraud , ” murmured poirot . “ especially after that clever trick of theirs with the match and cigarette end . ”
christie	links	giraud glared , but continued : “ a man must have been connected with the case , in order to dig the grave . there is no man who actually benefits by the crime , but there was a man who thought he would benefit . i heard of jack renauld ’ s quarrel with his father , and of the threats that he had used . the motive was established . now as to means . jack renauld was in merlinville that night . he concealed the fact—which turned suspicion into certainty . then we found a second victim—_stabbed with the same dagger___ . we know when that dagger was stolen . captain hastings here can fix the time . jack renauld , arriving from cherbourg , was the only person who could have taken it . i have accounted for all the other members of the household . ”
christie	links	poirot interrupted : “ you are wrong . there is one other person who could have taken the dagger. ” “ you refer to m. stonor ? he arrived at the front door , in an automobile which had brought him straight from calais . ah , believe me , i have looked into everything . m. jack renauld arrived by train . an hour elapsed between his arrival , and the moment he presented himself at the house . without doubt , he saw captain hastings and his companion leave the shed , slipped in himself and took the dagger , stabbed his accomplice in the shed— ”
christie	links	“ who was already dead ! ” giraud shrugged his shoulders . “ possibly he did not observe that . he may have judged him to be sleeping . without doubt they had a rendezvous . in any case he knew this apparent second murder would greatly complicate the case . it did . ”
christie	links	“ but it could not deceive m. giraud , ” murmured poirot . “ you mock yourself at me . but i will give you one last irrefutable proof . madame renauld ’ s story was false—a fabrication from beginning to end . we believe madame renauld to have loved her husband—_yet she lied to shield his murderer___ . for whom will a woman lie ? sometimes for herself , usually for the man she loves , _always___ for her children . that is the last—the irrefutable proof . you can not get round it . ”
christie	links	giraud paused , flushed and triumphant . poirot regarded him steadily . “ that is my case , ” said giraud . “ what have you to say to it ? ” “ only that there is one thing you have failed to take into account . ”
christie	links	“ what is that ? ” “ jack renauld was presumably acquainted with the planning out of the golf course . he knew that the body would be discovered almost at once , when they started to dig the bunker . ”
christie	links	giraud laughed out loud . “ but it is idiotic what you say there ! he wanted the body to be found ! until it was found , he could not presume death , and would have been unable to enter into his inheritance . ”
christie	links	i saw a quick flash of green in poirot ’ s eyes as he rose to his feet . “ then why bury it ? ” he asked softly . “ reflect , giraud . since it was to jack renauld ’ s advantage that the body should be found without delay , _why dig a grave at all ? ___ ”
christie	links	giraud did not reply . the question found him unprepared . he shrugged his shoulders as though to intimate that it was of no importance . poirot moved towards the door . i followed him .
christie	links	“ there is one more thing that you have failed to take into account , ” he said over his shoulder . “ what is that ? ” “ the piece of lead piping , ” said poirot , and left the room .
christie	links	jack renauld still stood in the hall , with a white dumb face , but as we came out of the _salon___ , he looked up sharply . at the same moment there was the sound of a footfall on the staircase . mrs. renauld was descending it . at the sight of her son , standing between the two myrmidons of the law , she stopped as though petrified .
christie	links	“ jack , ” she faltered . “ jack , what is this ? ” he looked up at her , his face set . “ they have arrested me , mother. ” “ what ? ” she uttered a piercing cry , and before any one could get to her swayed and fell heavily . we both ran to her and lifted her up . in a minute poirot stood up again .
christie	links	“ she has cut her head badly , on the corner of the stairs . i fancy there is a slight concussion also . if giraud wants a statement from her , he will have to wait . she will probably be unconscious for at least a week . ”
christie	links	denise and françoise had run to their mistress , and leaving her in their charge poirot left the house . he walked with his head bent down , frowning thoughtfully at the ground . for some time i did not speak , but at last i ventured to put a question to him .
christie	links	“ do you believe then , in spite of all appearances to the contrary , that jack renauld may not be guilty ? ” poirot did not answer at once , but after a long wait he said gravely :
christie	links	“ i do not know , hastings . there is just a chance of it . of course giraud is all wrong—wrong from beginning to end . if jack renauld is guilty , it is in spite of giraud ’ s arguments , not _because___ of them . and the gravest indictment against him is known only to me . ”
christie	links	“ what is that ? ” i asked , impressed . “ if you would use your grey cells , and see the whole case clearly as i do , you too would perceive it , my friend. ” this was what i called one of poirot ’ s irritating answers . he went on , without waiting for me to speak .
christie	links	“ let us walk this way to the sea . we will sit on that little mound there , overlooking the beach , and review the case . you shall know all that i know , but i would prefer that you should come at the truth by your own efforts—not by my leading you by the hand . ”
christie	links	we established ourselves on the grassy knoll as poirot had suggested , looking out to sea . from farther along the sand , the cries of the bathers reached us faintly . the sea was of the palest blue , and the halcyon calm reminded me of the day we had arrived at merlinville , my own good spirits , and poirot ’ s suggestion that i was “ fey. ” what a long time seemed to have elapsed since then . and in reality it was only three days !
christie	links	“ think , my friend , ” said poirot ’ s voice encouragingly . “ arrange your ideas . be methodical . be orderly . there is the secret of success. ” i endeavoured to obey him , casting my mind back over all the details of the case . and reluctantly it seemed to me that the only clear and possible solution was that of giraud—which poirot despised . i reflected anew . if there was daylight anywhere it was in the direction of madame daubreuil . giraud was ignorant of her connection with the beroldy case . poirot had declared the beroldy case to be all important . it was there i must seek . i was on the right track now . and suddenly i started as an idea of bewildering luminosity shot into my brain . trembling i built up my hypothesis .
christie	links	“ you have a little idea , i see , _mon ami ! ___ capital . we progress. ” i sat up , and lit a pipe . “ poirot , ” i said , “ it seems to me we have been strangely remiss . i say we—although i dare say _i___ would be nearer the mark . but you must pay the penalty of your determined secrecy . so i say again we have been strangely remiss . there is some one we have forgotten . ”
christie	links	“ and who is that ? ” inquired poirot , with twinkling eyes . “ georges conneau ! ” 20 an amazing statement the next moment poirot embraced me warmly . “ _enfin ! ___ you have arrived . and all by yourself . it is superb ! continue your reasoning . you are right . decidedly we have done wrong to forget georges conneau . ”
christie	links	i was so flattered by the little man ’ s approval that i could hardly continue . but at last i collected my thoughts and went on . “ georges conneau disappeared twenty years ago , but we have no reason to believe that he is dead . ”
christie	links	“ _aucunement___ , ” agreed poirot . “ proceed. ” “ therefore we will assume that he is alive. ” “ exactly. ” “ or that he was alive until recently. ” “ _de mieux en mieux ! ___ ” “ we will presume , ” i continued , my enthusiasm rising , “ that he has fallen on evil days . he has become a criminal , an apache , a tramp—a what you will . he chances to come to merlinville . there he finds the woman he has never ceased to love . ”
christie	links	“ eh eh ! the sentimentality , ” warned poirot . “ where one hates one also loves , ” i quoted or misquoted . “ at any rate he finds her there , living under an assumed name . but she has a new lover , the englishman , renauld . georges conneau , the memory of old wrongs rising in him , quarrels with this renauld . he lies in wait for him as he comes to visit his mistress , and stabs him in the back . then , terrified at what he has done , he starts to dig a grave . i imagine it likely that madame daubreuil comes out to look for her lover . she and conneau have a terrible scene . he drags her into the shed , and there suddenly falls down in an epileptic fit . now supposing jack renauld to appear . madame daubreuil tells him all , points out to him the dreadful consequences to her daughter if this scandal of the past is revived . his father ’ s murderer is dead—let them do their best to hush it up . jack renauld consents—goes to the house and has an interview with his mother , winning her over to his point of view . primed with the story that madame daubreuil has suggested to him , she permits herself to be gagged and bound . there , poirot , what do you think of that ? ” i leaned back , flushed with the pride of successful reconstruction .
christie	links	poirot looked at me thoughtfully . “ i think that you should write for the kinema , _mon ami___ , ” he remarked at last . “ you mean— ? ” “ it would make a good film , the story that you have recounted to me there—but it bears no sort of resemblance to everyday life . ”
christie	links	“ i admit that i haven ’ t gone into all the details , but— ” “ you have gone further—you have ignored them magnificently . what about the way the two men were dressed ? do you suggest that after stabbing his victim , conneau removed his suit of clothes , donned it himself , and replaced the dagger ? ”
christie	links	“ i don ’ t see that that matters , ” i objected rather huffily . “ he may have obtained clothes and money from madame daubreuil by threats earlier in the day. ” “ by threats—eh ? you seriously advance that supposition ? ”
christie	links	“ certainly . he could have threatened to reveal her identity to the renaulds , which would probably have put an end to all hopes of her daughter ’ s marriage. ” “ you are wrong , hastings . he could not blackmail her , for she had the whip hand . georges conneau , remember , is still wanted for murder . a word from her and he is in danger of the guillotine . ”
christie	links	i was forced , rather reluctantly , to admit the truth of this . “ _your___ theory , ” i remarked acidly , “ is doubtless correct as to all the details ? ” “ my theory is the truth , ” said poirot quietly . “ and the truth is necessarily correct . in your theory you made a fundamental error . you permitted your imagination to lead you astray with midnight assignations and passionate love scenes . but in investigating crime we must take our stand upon the commonplace . shall i demonstrate my methods to you ? ”
christie	links	“ oh , by all means let us have a demonstration ! ” poirot sat very upright and began , wagging his forefinger emphatically to emphasize his points . “ i will start as you started from the basic fact of georges conneau . now the story told by madame beroldy in court as to the ‘ russians ’ was admittedly a fabrication . if she was innocent of connivance in the crime , it was concocted by her , and by her only as she stated . if , on the other hand , she was not innocent , it might have been invented by either her or georges conneau .
christie	links	“ now in this case we are investigating , we meet the same tale . as i pointed out to you , the facts render it very unlikely that madame daubreuil inspired it . so we turn to the hypothesis that the story had its origin in the brain of georges conneau . very good . georges conneau , therefore , planned the crime with madame renauld as his accomplice . she is in the limelight , and behind her is a shadowy figure whose alias is unknown to us .
christie	links	“ now let us go carefully over the renauld case from the beginning , setting down each significant point in its chronological order . you have a notebook and pencil ? good . now what is the earliest point to note down ? ”
christie	links	“ the letter to you ? ” “ that was the first we knew of it , but it is not the proper beginning of the case . the first point of any significance , i should say , is the change that came over m. renauld shortly after arriving in merlinville , and which is attested to by several witnesses . we have also to consider his friendship with madame daubreuil , and the large sums of money paid over to her . from thence we can come directly to the 23rd may . ”
christie	links	poirot paused , cleared his throat , and signed to me to write . “ _23rd may.___ m. renauld quarrels with his son over latter ’ s wish to marry marthe daubreuil . son leaves for paris .
christie	links	“ _24th may.___ m. renauld alters his will , leaving entire control of his fortune in his wife ’ s hands . “ _7th june.___ quarrel with tramp in garden , witnessed by marthe daubreuil . “ letter written to m. hercule poirot , imploring assistance .
christie	links	“ telegram sent to jack renauld , bidding him proceed by the _anzora___ to buenos ayres . “ chauffeur , masters , sent off on a holiday . “ visit of a lady , that evening . as he is seeing her out , his words are ‘ yes , yes—but for god ’ s sake go now.… ’ ”
christie	links	poirot paused . “ there , hastings , take each of those facts one by one , consider them carefully by themselves and in relation to the whole , and see if you do not get new light on the matter . ”
christie	links	i endeavoured conscientiously to do as he had said . after a moment or two , i said rather doubtfully : “ as to the first points , the question seems to be whether we adopt the theory of blackmail , or of an infatuation for this woman . ”
christie	links	“ blackmail , decidedly . you heard what stonor said as to his character and habits. ” “ mrs . renauld did not confirm his view , ” i argued . “ we have already seen that madame renauld ’ s testimony can not be relied upon in any way . we must trust to stonor on that point . ”
christie	links	“ still , if renauld had an affair with a woman called bella , there seems no inherent improbability in his having another with madame daubreuil. ” “ none whatever , i grant you , hastings . but did he ? ”
christie	links	“ the letter , poirot . you forget the letter. ” “ no , i do not forget . but what makes you think that letter was written to m. renauld ? ” “ why it was found in his pocket and—and— ”
christie	links	“ and that is all ! ” cut in poirot . “ there was no mention of any name to show to whom the letter was addressed . we assumed it was to the dead man because it was in the pocket of his overcoat . now , _mon ami___ , something about that overcoat struck me as unusual . i measured it , and made the remark that he wore his overcoat very long . that remark should have given you to think . ”
christie	links	“ i thought you were just saying it for the sake of saying something , ” i confessed . “ ah , _quelle idée ! ___ later you observed me measuring the overcoat of m. jack renauld . _eh bien___ , m. jack renauld wears his overcoat very short . put those two facts together with a third , namely that m. jack renauld flung out of the house in a hurry on his departure for paris , and tell me what you make of it ! ”
christie	links	“ i see , ” i said slowly , as the meaning of poirot ’ s remarks bore in upon me . “ that letter was written to jack renauld—not to his father . he caught up the wrong overcoat in his haste and agitation . ”
christie	links	poirot nodded . “ _précisement ! ___ we can return to this point later . for the moment let us content ourselves with accepting the letter as having nothing to do with m. renauld _père___ , and pass to the next chronological event . ”
christie	links	“ may 23rd , ” i read , “ m . renauld quarrels with his son over latter ’ s wish to marry marthe daubreuil . son leaves for paris . i don ’ t see anything much to remark upon there , and the altering of the will the following day seems straightforward enough . it was the direct result of the quarrel . ”
christie	links	“ we agree , _mon ami___—at least as to the cause . but what exact motive underlay this procedure of m. renauld ’ s ? ” i opened my eyes in surprise . “ anger against his son of course . ”
christie	links	“ yet he wrote him affectionate letters to paris ? ” “ so jack renauld says , but he can not produce them. ” “ well , let us pass from that. ” “ now we come to the day of the tragedy . you have placed the events of the morning in a certain order . have you any justification for that ? ”
christie	links	“ i have ascertained that the letter to me was posted at the same time as the telegram was despatched . masters was informed he could take a holiday shortly afterwards . in my opinion the quarrel with the tramp took place anterior to these happenings . ”
christie	links	“ i do not see that you can fix that definitely—unless you question mademoiselle dabreuil again. ” “ there is no need . i am sure of it . and if you do not see that , you see nothing , hastings ! ”
christie	links	i looked at him for a moment . “ of course ! i am an idiot . if the tramp was georges conneau , it was after the stormy interview with him that mr. renauld apprehended danger . he sent away the chauffeur , masters , whom he suspected of being in the other ’ s pay , he wired to his son , and sent for you . ”
christie	links	a faint smile crossed poirot ’ s lips . “ you do not think it strange that he should use exactly the same expressions in his letter as madame renauld used later in her story ? if the mention of santiago was a blind , why should renauld speak of it , and—what is more—send his son there ? ”
christie	links	“ it is puzzling , i admit , but perhaps we shall find some explanation later . we come now to the evening , and the visit of the mysterious lady . i confess that that fairly baffles me , unless it was madame daubreuil , as françoise all along maintained . ”
christie	links	poirot shook his head . “ my friend , my friend , where are your wits wandering ? remember the fragment of cheque , and the fact that the name bella duveen was faintly familiar to stonor , and i think we may take it for granted that bella duveen is the full name of jack ’ s unknown correspondent , and that it was she who came to the villa geneviève that night . whether she intended to see jack , or whether she meant all along to appeal to his father we can not be certain , but i think we may assume that this is what occurred . she produced her claim upon jack , probably showed letters that he had written her , and the older man tried to buy her off by writing a cheque . this she indignantly tore up . the terms of her letter are those of a woman genuinely in love , and she would probably deeply resent being offered money . in the end he got rid of her , and here the words that he used are significant . ”
christie	links	“ ‘ yes , yes , but for god ’ s sake go now , ’ ” i repeated . “ they seem to me a little vehement , perhaps , that is all. ” “ that is enough . he was desperately anxious for the girl to go . why ? not only because the interview was unpleasant . no , it was the time that was slipping by , and for some reason time was precious . ”
christie	links	“ why should it be ? ” i asked , bewildered . “ that is what we ask ourselves . why should it be ? but later we have the incident of the wrist watch—which again shows us that time plays a very important part in the crime . we are now fast approaching the actual drama . it is half-past ten when bella duveen leaves , and by the evidence of the wrist watch we know that the crime was committed , or at any rate that it was staged , before twelve o ’ clock . we have reviewed all the events anterior to the murder , there remains only one unplaced . by the doctor ’ s evidence , the tramp , when found , had been dead at least forty-eight hours—with a possible margin of twenty-four hours more . now , with no other facts to help me than those we have discussed , i place the death as having occurred on the morning of june 7th . ”
christie	links	i stared at him , stupefied . “ but how ? why ? how can you possibly know ? ” “ because only in that way can the sequence of events be logically explained . _mon ami___ , i have taken you step by step along the way . do you not now see what is so glaringly plain ? ”
christie	links	“ my dear poirot , i can ’ t see anything glaring about it . i did think i was beginning to see my way before , but i ’ m now hopelessly fogged. ” poirot looked at me sadly , and shook his head . “ _mon dieu ! ___ but it is _triste ! ___ a good intelligence—and so deplorably lacking in method . there is an exercise most excellent for the development of the little grey cells . i will impart it to you— ”
christie	links	“ for heaven ’ s sake , not now ! you really are the most irritating of fellows , poirot . for goodness ’ sake , get on and tell me who killed m. renauld. ” “ that is just what i am not sure of as yet . ”
christie	links	“ but you said it was glaringly clear ? ” “ we talk at cross-purposes , my friend . remember , it is two crimes we are investigating—for which , as i pointed out to you , we have the necessary two bodies . there , there , _ne vous impatientez pas ! ___ i explain all . to begin with , we apply our psychology . we find three points at which m. renauld displays a distinct change of view and action—three psychological points therefore . the first occurs immediately after arriving in merlinville , the second after quarrelling with his son on a certain subject , the third on the morning of june 7th . now for the three causes . we can attribute no . 1 to meeting madame daubreuil . no . 2 is indirectly connected with her since it concerns a marriage between m. renauld ’ s son and her daughter . but the cause of no . 3 is hidden from us . we have to deduce it . now , _mon ami___ , let me ask you a question ; who do we believe to have planned this crime ? ”
christie	links	“ georges conneau , ” i said doubtfully , eyeing poirot warily . “ exactly . now giraud laid it down as an axiom that a woman lies to save herself , the man she loves , and her child . since we are satisfied that was georges conneau who dictated the lie to her , and as georges conneau is not jack renauld , follows that the third case is put out of court . and , still attributing the crime to georges conneau , the first is equally so . so we are forced to the second—that madame renauld lied for the sake of the man she loved—or in other words , for the sake of georges conneau . you agree to that . ”
christie	links	“ yes , ” i admitted . “ it seems logical enough. ” “ _bien ! ___ madame renauld loves georges conneau . who , then , is georges conneau ? ” “ the tramp. ” “ have we any evidence to show that madame renauld loved the tramp ? ”
christie	links	“ no , but— ” “ very well then . do not cling to theories where facts no longer support them . ask yourself instead who madame renauld _did___ love. ” i shook my head perplexed . “ _mais , oui___ , you know perfectly . who did madame renauld love so dearly that when she saw his dead body , she fell down in a swoon ? ”
christie	links	i stared dumbfounded . “ her husband ? ” i gasped . poirot nodded . “ her husband—or georges conneau , whichever you like to call him. ” i rallied myself . “ but it ’ s impossible. ” “ how ‘ impossible ? ’ did we not agree just now that madame daubreuil was in a position to blackmail georges conneau ? ”
christie	links	“ yes , but— ” “ and did she not very effectively blackmail m. renauld ? ” “ that may be true enough , but— ” “ and is it not a fact that we know nothing of m. renauld ’ s youth and upbringing ? that he springs suddenly into existence as a french canadian exactly twenty-two years ago ? ”
christie	links	“ all that is so , ” i said more firmly , “ but you seem to me to be overlooking one salient point. ” “ what is it , my friend ? ” “ why , we have admitted georges conneau planned the crime . that brings us to the ridiculous statement that he planned his own murder ! ”
christie	links	“ _eh bien , mon ami___ , ” said poirot placidly , “ that is just what he did do ! ” 21 hercule poirot on the case ! in a measured voice , poirot began his exposition . “ it seems strange to you , _mon ami___ , that a man should plan his own death ? so strange , that you prefer to reject the truth as fantastic , and to revert to a story that is in reality ten times more impossible . yes , m. renauld planned his own death , but there is one detail that perhaps escapes you—he did not intend to die . ”
christie	links	i shook my head , bewildered . “ but no , it is all most simple really , ” said poirot kindly . “ for the crime that m. renauld proposed a murderer was not necessary , as i told you , but a body was . let us reconstruct , seeing events this time from a different angle .
christie	links	“ georges conneau flies from justice—to canada . there , under an assumed name he marries , and finally acquires a vast fortune in south america . but there is a nostalgia upon him for his own country . twenty years have elapsed , he is considerably changed in appearance , besides being a man of such eminence that no one is likely to connect him with a fugitive from justice many years ago . he deems it quite safe to return . he takes up his headquarters in england , but intends to spend the summers in france . and ill fortune , that obscure justice which shapes men ’ s ends , and will not allow them to evade the consequences of their acts , takes him to merlinville . there , in the whole of france , is the one person who is capable of recognizing him . it is , of course , a gold mine to madame daubreuil , and a gold mine of which she is not slow to take advantage . he is helpless , absolutely in her power . and she bleeds him heavily .
christie	links	“ and then the inevitable happens . jack renauld falls in love with the beautiful girl he sees almost daily , and wishes to marry her . that rouses his father . at all costs , he will prevent his son marrying the daughter of this evil woman . jack renauld knows nothing of his father ’ s past , but madame renauld knows everything . she is a woman of great force of character , and passionately devoted to her husband . they take counsel together . renauld sees only one way of escape—death . he must appear to die , in reality escaping to another country where he will start again under an assumed name , and where madame renauld , having played the widow ’ s part for a while , can join him . it is essential that she should have control of the money , so he alters his will . how they meant to manage the body business originally , i do not know—possibly an art student ’ s skeleton—and a fire or something of the kind , but long before their plans have matured an event occurs which plays into their hands . a rough tramp , violent and abusive , finds his way into the garden . there is a struggle , m. renauld seeks to eject him , and suddenly the tramp , an epileptic , falls down in a fit . he is dead . m. renauld calls his wife . together they drag him into the shed—as we know , the event had occurred just outside—and they realize the marvellous opportunity that has been vouchsafed them . the man bears no resemblance to m. renauld , but he is middle-aged , of a usual french type . that is sufficient .
christie	links	“ i rather fancy that they sat on the bench up there , out of earshot from the house , discussing matters . their plan was quickly made . the identification must rest solely on madame renauld ’ s evidence . jack renauld and the chauffeur ( who had been with his master two years ) must be got out of the way . it was unlikely that the french women servants would go near the body , and in any case renauld intended to take measures to deceive any one not likely to appreciate details . masters was sent off , a telegram despatched to jack , buenos ayres being selected to give credence to the story that renauld had decided upon . having heard of me , as a rather obscure elderly detective , he wrote his appeal for help knowing that , when i arrived , the production of the letter would have a profound effect upon the examining magistrate—which , of course , it did .
christie	links	“ they dressed the body of the tramp in a suit of m. renauld ’ s and left his ragged coat and trousers by the door of the shed , not daring to take them into the house . and then , to give credence to the tale madame renauld was to tell , they drove the aeroplane dagger through his heart . that night , m. renauld will first bind and gag his wife , and then , taking a spade , will dig a grave in that particular spot of ground where he knows a—how do you call it ? bunkair ? —is to be made . it is essential that the body should be found—madame daubreuil must have no suspicions . on the other hand , if a little time elapses , any dangers as to identity will be greatly lessened . then , m. renauld will don the tramp ’ s rags , and shuffle off to the station , where he will leave , unnoticed , by the 12:10 train . since the crime will be supposed to have taken place two hours later , no suspicion can possibly attach to him .
christie	links	“ you see now his annoyance at the inopportune visit of the girl bella . every moment of delay is fatal to his plans . he gets rid of her as soon as he can , however . then , to work ! he leaves the front door slightly ajar to create the impression that the assassins left that way . he binds and gags madame renauld , correcting his mistake of twenty-two years ago , when the looseness of the bonds caused suspicion to fall upon his accomplice , but leaving her primed with essentially the same story as he had invented before , proving the unconscious recoil of the mind against originality . the night is chilly , and he slips on an overcoat over his underclothing , intending to cast it into the grave with the dead man . he goes out by the window , smoothing over the flower bed carefully , and thereby furnishing the most positive evidence against himself . he goes out on to the lonely golf links , and he digs—and then— ”
christie	links	“ yes ? ” “ and then , ” said poirot gravely , “ the justice that he has so long eluded overtakes him . an unknown hand stabs him in the back.… now , hastings , you understand what i mean when i talk of _two___ crimes . the first crime , the crime that m. renauld , in his arrogance , asked us to investigate ( ah , but he made a famous mistake there ! he misjudged hercule poirot ! ) is solved . but behind it lies a deeper riddle . and to solve that will be difficult—since the criminal in his wisdom , has been content to avail himself of the devices prepared by m. renauld . it has been a particularly perplexing and baffling mystery to solve . a young hand , like giraud , who does not place any reliance on the psychology , is almost certain to fail . ”
christie	links	“ you ’ re marvellous , poirot , ” i said , with admiration . “ absolutely marvellous . no one on earth but you could have done it ! ” i think my praise pleased him . for once in his life , he looked almost embarrassed .
christie	links	“ ah , then you no longer despise poor old papa poirot ? you shift your allegiance back from the human foxhound ? ” his term for giraud never failed to make me smile . “ rather . you ’ ve scored over him handsomely . ”
christie	links	“ that poor giraud , ” said poirot , trying unsuccessfully to look modest . “ without doubt it is not all stupidity . he has had _la mauvaise chance___ once or twice . that dark hair coiled round the dagger , for instance . to say the least , it was misleading . ”
christie	links	“ to tell you the truth , poirot , ” i said slowly , “ even now i don ’ t quite see—whose hair was it ? ” “ madame renauld ’ s of course . that is where _la mauvaise chance___ came in . her hair , dark originally , is almost completely silvered . it might just as easily have been a grey hair—and then , by no conceivable effort could giraud have persuaded himself it came from the head of jack renauld ! but it is all of a piece . always the facts must be twisted to fit the theory ! did not giraud find the traces of two persons , a man and a woman , in the shed ? and how does that fit in with his reconstruction of the case ? i will tell you—it does not fit in , and so we shall hear no more of them ! i ask you , is that a methodical way of working ? the great giraud ! the great giraud is nothing but a toy balloon—swollen with its own importance . but i , hercule poirot , whom he despises , will be the little pin that pricks the big balloon—_comme ça ! ___ ” and he made an expressive gesture . then , calming down , he resumed :
christie	links	“ without doubt , when madame renauld recovers , she will speak . the possibility of her son being accused of the murder never occurred to her . how should it , when she believed him safely at sea on board the _anzora ? ___ _ah ! voilà une femme___ , hastings ! what force , what self-command ! she only made one slip . on his unexpected return : ‘ it does not matter—_now___. ’ and no one noticed—no one realized the significance of those words . what a terrible part she has had to play , poor woman . imagine the shock when she goes to identify the body and , instead of what she expects , sees the actual lifeless form of the husband she has believed miles away by now . no wonder she fainted ! but since then , despite her grief and her despair , how resolutely she has played her part , and how the anguish of it must wring her . she can not say a word to set us on the track of the real murderers . for her son ’ s sake , no one must know that paul renauld was georges conneau , the criminal . final and most bitter blow , she has admitted publicly that madame daubreuil was her husband ’ s mistress—for a hint of blackmail might be fatal to her secret . how cleverly she dealt with the examining magistrate when he asked her if there was any mystery in her husband ’ s past life . ‘ nothing so romantic , i am sure , m. le juge. ’ it was perfect , the indulgent tone , the _soupçon___ of sad mockery . at once m. hautet felt himself foolish and melodramatic . yes , she is a great woman ! if she loved a criminal , she loved him royally ! ”
christie	links	poirot lost himself in contemplation . “ one thing more , poirot , what about the piece of lead piping ? ” “ you do not see ? to disfigure the victim ’ s face so that it would be unrecognizable . it was that which first set me on the right track . and that imbecile of a giraud , swarming all over it to look for match ends ! did i not tell you that a clue of two feet long was quite as good as a clue of two inches ? ”
christie	links	“ well , giraud will sing small now , ” i observed hastily , to lead the conversation away from my own shortcomings . “ as i said before , will he ? if he has arrived at the right person by the wrong method , he will not permit that to worry him . ”
christie	links	“ but surely— ” i paused as i saw the new trend of things . “ you see , hastings , we must now start again . who killed m. renauld ? some one who was near the villa just before twelve o ’ clock that night , some one who would benefit by his death—the description fits jack renauld only too well . the crime need not have been premeditated . and then the dagger ! ”
christie	links	i started , i had not realized that point . “ of course , ” i said . “ the second dagger we found in the tramp was mrs. renauld ’ s . there _were___ two , then. ” “ certainly , and , since they were duplicates , it stands to reason that jack renauld was the owner . but that would not trouble me so much . in fact i have a little idea as to that . no , the worst indictment against him is again psychological—heredity , _mon ami___ , heredity ! like father , like son—jack renauld , when all is said or done , is the son of georges conneau . ”
christie	links	his tone was grave and earnest , and i was impressed in spite of myself . “ what is your little idea that you mentioned just now ? ” i asked . for answer , poirot consulted his turnip-faced watch , and then asked :
christie	links	“ what time is the afternoon boat from calais ? ” “ about five , i believe. ” “ that will do very well . we shall just have time. ” “ you are going to england ? ” “ yes , my friend . ”
christie	links	“ why ? ” “ to find a possible—witness. ” “ who ? ” with a rather peculiar smile upon his face , poirot replied : “ miss bella duveen. ” “ but how will you find her—what do you know about her ? ”
christie	links	“ i know nothing about her—but i can guess a good deal . we may take it for granted that her name _is___ bella duveen , and since that name was faintly familiar to m. stonor , though evidently not in connection with the renauld family , it is probable that she is on the stage . jack renauld was a young man with plenty of money , and twenty years of age . the stage is sure to have been the home of his first love . it tallies , too , with m. renauld ’ s attempt to placate her with a cheque . i think i shall find her all right—especially with the help of _this___ . ”
christie	links	and he brought out the photograph i had seen him take from jack renauld ’ s drawer . “ with love from bella , ” was scrawled across the corner , but it was not that which held my eyes fascinated . the likeness was not first rate—but for all that it was unmistakable to me . i felt a cold sinking , as though some unutterable calamity had befallen me .
christie	links	it was the face of cinderella . 22 i find love for a moment or two i sat as though frozen , the photograph still in my hand . then , summoning all my courage to appear unmoved , i handed it back . at the same time , i stole a quick glance at poirot . had he noticed anything ? but to my relief he did not seem to be observing me . anything unusual in my manner had certainly escaped him .
christie	links	he rose briskly to his feet . “ we have no time to lose . we must make our departure with all despatch . all is well—the sea it will be calm ! ” in the bustle of departure , i had no time for thinking , but once on board the boat , secure from poirot ’ s observation ( he , as usual , was “ practising the method most excellent of laverguier ” ) i pulled myself together , and attacked the facts dispassionately . how much did poirot know ? was he aware that my acquaintance of the train and bella duveen were one and the same ? why had he gone to the hôtel du phare ? on my behalf as i had believed ? or had i only fatuously thought so , and was this visit undertaken with a deeper and more sinister purpose ?
christie	links	but in any case , why was he bent on finding this girl ? did he suspect her of having seen jack renauld commit the crime ? or did he suspect—but that was impossible ! the girl had no grudge against the elder renauld , no possible motive for wishing his death . what had brought her back to the scene of the murder ? i went over the facts carefully . she must have left the train at calais where i parted from her that day . no wonder i had been unable to find her on the boat . if she had dined in calais , and then taken a train out to merlinville , she would have arrived at the villa geneviève just about the time that françoise said . what had she done when she left the house just after ten ? presumably either gone to an hotel , or returned to calais . and then ? the crime had been committed on tuesday night . on thursday morning , she was once more in merlinville . had she ever left france at all ? i doubted it very much . what kept her there—the hope of seeing jack renauld ? i had told her ( as at the time we believed ) that he was on the high seas _en route___ to buenos ayres . possibly she was aware that the _anzora___ had not sailed . but to know that she must have seen jack . was that what poirot was after ? had jack renauld , returning to see marthe daubreuil , come face to face instead with bella duveen , the girl he had heartlessly thrown over ?
christie	links	i began to see daylight . if that were indeed the case , it might furnish jack with the alibi he needed . yet under those circumstances his silence seemed difficult to explain . why could he not have spoken out boldly ? did he fear for this former entanglement of his to come to the ears of marthe daubreuil ? i shook my head , dissatisfied . the thing had been harmless enough , a foolish boy and girl affair , and i reflected cynically that the son of a millionaire was not likely to be thrown over by a penniless french girl , who moreover loved him devotedly , without a much graver cause .
christie	links	altogether i found the affair puzzling and unsatisfactory . i disliked intensely being associated with poirot in hunting this girl down , but i could not see any way of avoiding it , without revealing everything to him , and this , for some reason , i was loath to do .
christie	links	poirot reappeared brisk and smiling at dover , and our journey to london was uneventful . it was past nine o ’ clock when we arrived , and i supposed that we should return straight away to our rooms and do nothing till the morning . but poirot had other plans .
christie	links	“ we must lose no time , _mon ami___ . the news of the arrest will not be in the english papers until the day after tomorrow , but still we must lose no time . ”
christie	links	i did not quite follow his reasoning , but i merely asked how he proposed to find the girl . “ you remember joseph aarons , the theatrical agent ? no ? i assisted him in a little matter of a japanese wrestler . a pretty little problem , i must recount it to you one day . he , without doubt , will be able to put us in the way of finding out what we want to know . ”
christie	links	it took us some time to run mr. aarons to earth , and it was after midnight when we finally managed it . he greeted poirot with every evidence of warmth , and professed himself ready to be of service to us in any way .
christie	links	“ there ’ s not much about the profession i don ’ t know , ” he said , beaming genially . “ _eh bien___ , m. aarons , i desire to find a young girl called bella duveen. ” “ bella duveen . i know the name , but for the moment i can ’ t place it . what ’ s her line ? ”
christie	links	“ that i do not know—but here is her photograph. ” mr. aarons studied it for a moment , then his face lighted . “ got it ! ” he slapped his thigh . “ the dulcibella kids , by the lord ! ”
christie	links	“ the dulcibella kids ? ” “ that ’ s it . they ’ re sisters . acrobats , dancers and singers . give quite a good little turn . they ’ re in the provinces somewhere , i believe—if they ’ re not resting . they ’ ve been on in paris for the last two or three weeks . ”
christie	links	“ can you find out for me exactly where they are ? ” “ easy as a bird . you go home , and i ’ ll send you round the dope in the morning. ” with this promise we took leave of him . he was as good as his word . about eleven o ’ clock the following day , a scribbled note reached us .
christie	links	“ the dulcibella sisters are on at the palace in coventry . good luck to you. ” without more ado , we started for coventry . poirot made no inquiries at the theatre , but contented himself with booking stalls for the variety performance that evening .
christie	links	the show was wearisome beyond words—or perhaps it was only my mood that made it seem so . japanese families balanced themselves precariously , would-be fashionable men , in greenish evening dress and exquisitely slicked hair , reeled off society patter and danced marvellously , stout prima donnas sang at the top of the human register , a comic comedian endeavoured to be mr. george robey and failed signally .
christie	links	at last the number went up which announced the dulcibella kids . my heart beat sickeningly . there she was—there they both were , the pair of them , one flaxen haired , one dark , matching as to size , with short fluffy skirts and immense buster brown bows . they looked a pair of extremely piquant children . they began to sing . their voices were fresh and true , rather thin and music-hally , but attractive .
christie	links	it was quite a pretty little turn . they danced neatly , and did some clever little acrobatic feats . the words of their songs were crisp and catchy . when the curtain fell , there was a full meed of applause . evidently the dulcibella kids were a success .
christie	links	suddenly i felt that i could remain no longer . i must get out into the air . i suggested leaving to poirot . “ go by all means , _mon ami___ . i amuse myself , and will stay to the end . i will rejoin you later . ”
christie	links	it was only a few steps from the theatre to the hotel . i went up to the sitting-room , ordered a whisky and soda , and sat drinking it , staring meditatively into the empty grate . i heard the door open , and turned my head , thinking it was poirot . then i jumped to my feet . it was cinderella who stood in the doorway . she spoke haltingly , her breath coming in little gasps .
christie	links	“ i saw you in front . you and your friend . when you got up to go , i was waiting outside and followed you . why are you here—in coventry ? what were you doing there to-night ? is the man who was with you the—the detective ? ”
christie	links	she stood there , the cloak she had wrapped round her stage dress slipping from her shoulders . i saw the whiteness of her cheeks under the rouge , and heard the terror in her voice . and in that moment i understood everything—understood why poirot was seeking her , and what she feared , and understood at last my own heart.…
christie	links	“ yes , ” i said gently . “ is he looking for—me ? ” she half whispered . then , as i did not answer for a moment , she slipped down by the big chair , and burst into violent , bitter weeping .
christie	links	i knelt down by her , holding her in my arms , and smoothing the hair back from her face . “ don ’ t cry , child , don ’ t cry , for god ’ s sake . you ’ re safe here . i ’ ll take care of you . don ’ t cry , darling . don ’ t cry . i know—i know everything . ”
christie	links	“ oh , but you don ’ t ! ” “ i think i do. ” and after a moment , as her sobs grew quieter , i asked : “ it was you who took the dagger , wasn ’ t it ? ” “ yes. ” “ that was why you wanted me to show you round ? and why you pretended to faint ? ”
christie	links	again she nodded . it was a strange thought to come to me at the moment , but it shot into my mind that i was glad her motive was what it had been—rather than the idle and morbid curiosity i had accused her of at the time . how gallantly she had played her part that day , inwardly racked with fear and trepidation as she must have been . poor little soul , bearing the burden of a moment ’ s impetuous action .
christie	links	“ why did you take the dagger ? ” i asked presently . she replied as simply as a child : “ i was afraid there might be finger-marks on it. ” “ but didn ’ t you remember that you had worn gloves ? ”
christie	links	she shook her head as though bewildered , and then said slowly : “ are you going to give me up to—to the police ? ” “ good god ! no. ” her eyes sought mine long and earnestly , and then she asked in a little quiet voice that sounded afraid of itself :
christie	links	“ why not ? ” it seemed a strange place and a strange time for a declaration of love—and god knows , in all my imagining , i had never pictured love coming to me in such a guise . but i answered simply and naturally enough :
christie	links	“ because i love you , cinderella. ” she bent her head down , as though ashamed , and muttered in a broken voice : “ you can ’ t—you can ’ t—not if you knew— ” and then , as though rallying herself , she faced me squarely , and asked :
christie	links	“ what do you know , then ? ” “ i know that you came to see mr. renauld that night . he offered you a cheque and you tore it up indignantly . then you left the house— ” i paused .
christie	links	“ go on—what next ? ” “ i don ’ t know whether you knew that jack renauld would be coming that night , or whether you just waited about on the chance of seeing him , but you did wait about . perhaps you were just miserable , and walked aimlessly—but at any rate just before twelve you were still near there , and you saw a man on the golf links— ”
christie	links	again i paused . i had leapt to the truth in a flash as she entered the room , but now the picture rose before me even more convincingly . i saw vividly the peculiar pattern of the overcoat on the dead body of mr. renauld , and i remembered the amazing likeness that had startled me into believing for one instant that the dead man had risen from the dead when his son burst into our conclave in the _salon___ .
christie	links	“ go on , ” repeated the girl steadily . “ i fancy his back was to you—but you recognized him , or thought you recognized him . the gait and the carriage were familiar to you , and the pattern of his overcoat. ” i paused . “ you told me in the train on the way from paris that you had italian blood in your veins , and that you had nearly got into trouble once with it . you used a threat in one of your letters to jack renauld . when you saw him there , your anger and jealousy drove you mad—and you struck ! i don ’ t believe for a minute that you meant to kill him . but you did kill him , cinderella . ”
christie	links	she had flung up her hands to cover her face , and in a choked voice she said : “ you ’ re right… you ’ re right… i can see it all as you tell it. ” then she turned on me almost savagely . “ and you love me ? knowing what you do , how can you love me ? ”
christie	links	“ i don ’ t know , ” i said a little wearily . “ i think love is like that—a thing one can not help . i have tried , i know—ever since the first day i met you . and love has been too strong for me . ”
christie	links	and then suddenly , when i least expected it , she broke down again , casting herself down on the floor and sobbing wildly . “ oh , i can ’ t ! ” she cried . “ i don ’ t know what to do . i don ’ t know which way to turn . oh , pity me , pity me , some one , and tell me what to do ! ”
christie	links	again i knelt by her , soothing her as best i could . “ don ’ t be afraid of me , bella . for god ’ s sake don ’ t be afraid of me . i love you , that ’ s true—but i don ’ t want anything in return . only let me help you . love him still if you have to , but let me help you as he can ’ t . ”
christie	links	it was as though she had been turned to stone by my words . she raised her head from her hands and stared at me . “ you think that ? ” she whispered . “ you think that i love jack renauld ? ”
christie	links	then , half laughing , half crying , she flung her arms passionately round my neck , and pressed her sweet wet face to mine . “ not as i love you , ” she whispered . “ never as i love you ! ”
christie	links	her lips brushed my cheek , and then , seeking my mouth , kissed me again and again with a sweetness and fire beyond belief . the wildness of it—and the wonder , i shall not forget—no , not as long as i live !
christie	links	it was a sound in the doorway that made us look up . poirot was standing there looking at us . i did not hesitate . with a bound i reached him and pinioned his arms to his sides .
christie	links	“ quick , ” i said to the girl . “ get out of here . as fast as you can . i ’ ll hold him. ” with one look at me , she fled out of the room past us . i held poirot in a grip of iron .
christie	links	“ _mon ami___ , ” observed the latter mildly , “ you do this sort of thing very well . the strong man holds me in his grasp and i am helpless as a child . but all this is uncomfortable and slightly ridiculous . let us sit down and be calm . ”
christie	links	“ you won ’ t pursue her ? ” “ _mon dieu ! ___ no . am i giraud ? release me , my friend. ” keeping a suspicious eye upon him , for i paid poirot the compliment of knowing that i was no match for him in astuteness , i relaxed my grip , and he sank into an arm-chair , feeling his arms tenderly .
christie	links	“ it is that you have the strength of a bull when you are roused , hastings ! _eh bien___ , and do you think you have behaved well to your old friend ? i show you the girl ’ s photograph and you recognize it , but you never say a word . ”
christie	links	“ there was no need if you knew that i recognized it , ” i said rather bitterly . so poirot had known all along ! i had not deceived him for an instant . “ ta-ta ! you did not know that i knew that . and tonight you help the girl to escape when we have found her with so much trouble ! _eh bien ! ___ it comes to this—are you going to work with me or against me , hastings ? ”
christie	links	for a moment or two i did not answer . to break with my old friend gave me great pain . yet i must definitely range myself against him . would he ever forgive me , i wondered ? he had been strangely calm so far , but i knew him to possess marvellous self-command .
christie	links	“ poirot , ” i said , “ i ’ m sorry . i admit i ’ ve behaved badly to you over this . but sometimes one has no choice . and in future i must take my own line. ” poirot nodded his head several times .
christie	links	“ i understand , ” he said . the mocking light had quite died out of his eyes , and he spoke with a sincerity and kindness that surprised me . “ it is that , my friend , is it not ? it is love that has come—not as you imagined it , all cock a hoop with fine feathers , but sadly , with bleeding feet . well , well—i warned you . when i realized that this girl must have taken the dagger , i warned you . perhaps you remember . but already it was too late . but , tell me , how much do you know ? ”
christie	links	i met his eyes squarely . “ nothing that you could tell me would be any surprise to me , poirot . understand that . but in case you think of resuming your search for miss duveen , i should like you to know one thing clearly . if you have any idea that she was concerned in the crime , or was the mysterious lady who called upon mr. renauld that night , you are wrong . i travelled home from france with her that day , and parted from her at victoria that evening so that it is clearly impossible for her to have been in merlinville . ”
christie	links	“ ah ! ” poirot looked at me thoughtfully . “ and you would swear to that in a court of law ? ” “ most certainly i would. ” poirot rose and bowed . “ _mon ami ! vive l ’ amour ! ___ it can perform miracles . it is decidedly ingenious what you have thought of there . it defeats even hercule poirot ! ”
christie	links	23 difficulties ahead after a moment of stress , such as i have just described , reaction is bound to set in . i retired to rest that night on a note of triumph , but i awoke to realize that i was by no means out of the wood . true , i could see no flaw in the alibi i had so suddenly conceived . i had but to stick to my story , and i failed to see how bella could be convicted in face of it . it was not as though there was any old friendship between us that could be raked up , and which might lead them to suspect that i was committing perjury . it could be proved that in actual fact i had only seen the girl on three occasions . no , i was still satisfied with my idea—had not even poirot admitted that it defeated him ?
christie	links	but there i felt the need of treading warily . all very well for my little friend to admit himself momentarily nonplussed . i had far too much respect for his abilities to conceive of him as being content to remain in that position . i had a very humble opinion of my wits when it came to matching them against his . poirot would not take defeat lying down . somehow or other , he would endeavour to turn the tables on me , and that in the way , and at the moment , when i least expected it .
christie	links	we met at breakfast the following morning as though nothing had happened . poirot ’ s good temper was imperturbable , yet i thought i detected a film of reserve in his manner which was new . after breakfast , i announced my intention of going out for a stroll . a malicious gleam shot through poirot ’ s eyes .
christie	links	“ if it is information you seek , you need not be at the pains of deranging yourself . i can tell you all you wish to know . the dulcibella sisters have cancelled their contract , and have left coventry for an unknown destination . ”
christie	links	“ is that really so , poirot ? ” “ you can take it from me , hastings . i made inquiries the first thing this morning . after all , what else did you expect ? ” true enough , nothing else could be expected under the circumstances . cinderella had profited by the slight start i had been able to assure her , and would certainly not lose a moment in removing herself from the reach of the pursuer . it was what i had intended and planned . nevertheless , i was aware of being plunged into a network of fresh difficulties .
christie	links	i had absolutely no means of communicating with the girl , and it was vital that she should know the line of defence that had occurred to me , and which i was prepared to carry out . of course it was possible that she might try to send word to me in some way or another , but i hardly thought it likely . she would know the risk she ran of a message being intercepted by poirot , thus setting him on her track once more . clearly her only course was to disappear utterly for the time being .
christie	links	but , in the meantime , what was poirot doing ? i studied him attentively . he was wearing his most innocent air , and staring meditatively into the far distance . he looked altogether too placid and supine to give me reassurance . i had learned , with poirot , that the less dangerous he looked , the more dangerous he was . his quiescence alarmed me . observing a troubled quality in my glance , he smiled benignantly .
christie	links	“ you are puzzled , hastings ? you ask yourself why i do not launch myself in pursuit ? ” “ well—something of the kind. ” “ it is what you would do , were you in my place . i understand that . but i am not of those who enjoy rushing up and down a country seeking a needle in a haystack , as you english say . no—let mademoiselle bella duveen go . without doubt , i shall be able to find her when the time comes . until then , i am content to wait . ”
christie	links	i stared at him doubtfully . was he seeking to mislead me ? i had an irritating feeling that , even now , he was master of the situation . my sense of superiority was gradually waning . i had contrived the girl ’ s escape , and evolved a brilliant scheme for saving her from the consequences of her rash act—but i could not rest easy in my mind . poirot ’ s perfect calm awakened a thousand apprehensions .
christie	links	“ i suppose , poirot , ” i said rather diffidently , “ i mustn ’ t ask what your plans are ? i ’ ve forfeited the right. ” “ but not at all . there is no secret about them . we return to france without delay . ”
christie	links	“ _we ? ___ ” “ precisely— ‘ _we ! ___ ’ you know very well that you can not afford to let papa poirot out of your sight . eh , is it not so , my friend ? but remain in england by all means if you wish— ”
christie	links	i shook my head . he had hit the nail on the head . i could not afford to let him out of my sight . although i could not expect his confidence after what had happened , i could still check his actions . the only danger to bella lay with him . giraud and the french police were indifferent to her existence . at all costs i must keep near poirot .
christie	links	poirot observed me attentively as these reflections passed through my mind , and gave a nod of satisfaction . “ i am right , am i not ? and as you are quite capable of trying to follow me , disguised with some absurdity such as a false beard—which every one would perceive , _bien entendu___—i much prefer that we should voyage together . it would annoy me greatly that any one should mock themselves at you . ”
christie	links	“ very well , then . but it ’ s only fair to warn you— ” “ i know—i know all . you are my enemy ! be my enemy then . it does not worry me at all. ” “ so long as it ’ s all fair and above-board , i don ’ t mind . ”
christie	links	“ you have to the full the english passion for ‘ fair-play ! ’ now your scruples are satisfied , let us depart immediately . there is no time to be lost . our stay in england has been short but sufficient . i know—what i wanted to know . ”
christie	links	the tone was light , but i read a veiled menace into the words . “ still— ” i began , and stopped . “ still—as you say ! without doubt you are satisfied with the part you are playing . me , i preoccupy myself with jack renauld . ”
christie	links	jack renauld ! the words gave me a start . i had completely forgotten that aspect of the case . jack renauld , in prison , with the shadow of the guillotine looming over him ! i saw the part i was playing in a more sinister light . i could save bella—yes , but in doing so i ran the risk of sending an innocent man to his death .
christie	links	i pushed the thought from me with horror . it could not be . he would be acquitted . certainly he would be acquitted ! but the cold fear came back . suppose he were not ? what then ? could i have it on my conscience—horrible thought ! would it come to that in the end ? a decision . bella or jack renauld ? the promptings of my heart were to save the girl i loved at any cost to myself . but , if the cost were to another , the problem was altered .
christie	links	what would the girl herself say ? i remembered that no word of jack renauld ’ s arrest had passed my lips . as yet she was in total ignorance of the fact that her former lover was in prison charged with a hideous crime which he had not committed . when she knew , how would she act ? would she permit her life to be saved at the expense of his ? certainly she must do nothing rash . jack renauld might , and probably would , be acquitted without any intervention on her part . if so , good . but if he was not.… that was the terrible , the unanswerable problem . i fancied that she ran no risk of the extreme penalty . the circumstances of the crime were quite different in her case . she could plead jealousy and extreme provocation , and her youth and beauty would go for much . the fact that by a tragic mistake it was old mr. renauld , and not his son , who paid the penalty would not alter the motive of the crime . but in any case , however lenient the sentence of the court , it must mean a long term of imprisonment .
christie	links	no , bella must be protected . and , at the same time , jack renauld must be saved . how this was to be accomplished i did not see clearly . but i pinned my faith to poirot . he knew . come what might , he would manage to save an innocent man . he must find some pretext other than the real one . it might be difficult , but he would manage it somehow . and with bella unsuspected , and jack renauld acquitted , all would end satisfactorily .
christie	links	so i told myself repeatedly , but at the bottom of my heart there still remained a cold fear . 24 “ save him ! ” we crossed from england by the evening boat , and the following morning saw us in saint-omer , whither jack renauld had been taken . poirot lost no time in visiting m. hautet . as he did not seem disposed to make any objections to my accompanying him , i bore him company .
christie	links	after various formalities and preliminaries , we were conducted to the examining magistrate ’ s room . he greeted us cordially . “ i was told that you had returned to england , m. poirot . i am glad to find that such is not the case . ”
christie	links	“ it is true that i went there , m. le juge , but it was only for a flying visit . a side issue , but one that i fancied might repay investigation. ” “ and it did—eh ? ”
christie	links	poirot shrugged his shoulders . m. hautet nodded , sighing . “ we must resign ourselves , i fear . that animal giraud , his manners are abominable , but he is undoubtedly clever ! not much chance of that one making a mistake . ”
christie	links	“ you think not , m. le juge ? ” it was the examining magistrate ’ s turn to shrug his shoulders . “ _eh bien___ , speaking frankly—in confidence , _c ’ est entendu___—can you come to any other conclusion ? ” “ frankly , m. le juge , there seem to me to be many points that are obscure . ”
christie	links	“ such as— ? ” but poirot was not to be drawn . “ i have not yet tabulated them , ” he remarked . “ it was a general reflection that i was making . i liked the young man , and should be sorry to believe him guilty of such a hideous crime . by the way , what has he to say for himself on the matter ? ”
christie	links	the magistrate frowned . “ i can not understand him . he seems incapable of putting up any sort of defence . it has been most difficult to get him to answer questions . he contents himself with a general denial , and beyond that takes refuge in a most obstinate silence . i am interrogating him again tomorrow ; perhaps you would like to be present ? ”
christie	links	we accepted the invitation with _empressement___ . “ a distressing case , ” said the magistrate with a sigh . “ my sympathy for madame renauld is profound. ” “ how is madame renauld ? ” “ she has not yet recovered consciousness . it is merciful in a way , poor woman , she is being spared much . the doctors say that there is no danger , but that when she comes to herself she must be kept as quiet as possible . it was , i understand , quite as much the shock as the fall which caused her present state . it would be terrible if her brain became unhinged ; but i should not wonder at all—no , really , not at all . ”
christie	links	m. hautet leaned back , shaking his head , with a sort of mournful enjoyment , as he envisaged the gloomy prospect . he roused himself at length , and observed with a start . “ that reminds me . i have here a letter for you , m. poirot . let me see , where did i put it ? ”
christie	links	he proceeded to rummage amongst his papers . at last he found the missive , and handed it to poirot . “ it was sent under cover to me in order that i might forward it to you , ” he explained . “ but as you left no address i could not do so . ”
christie	links	poirot studied the letter curiously . it was addressed in a long , sloping , foreign hand , and the writing was decidedly a woman ’ s . poirot did not open it . instead he put it in his pocket and rose to his feet .
christie	links	“ _a demain___ then , m. le juge . many thanks for your courtesy and amiability. ” “ but not at all . i am always at your service . these young detectives of the school of giraud , they are all alike—rude , sneering fellows . they do not realize that an examining magistrate of my—er—experience is bound to have a certain discernment , a certain—_flair___ . _enfin ! ___ the politeness of the old school is infinitely more to my taste . therefore , my dear friend , command me in any way you will . we know a thing or two , you and i—eh ? ”
christie	links	and laughing heartily , enchanted with himself and with us , m. hautet bade us adieu . i am sorry to have to record that poirot ’ s first remark to me as we traversed the corridor was :
christie	links	“ a famous old imbecile , that one ! of a stupidity to make pity ! ” we were just leaving the building when we came face to face with giraud , looking more dandified than ever , and thoroughly pleased with himself .
christie	links	“ aha ! m. poirot , ” he cried airily . “ you have returned from england then ? ” “ as you see , ” said poirot . “ the end of the case is not far off now , i fancy. ” “ i agree with you , m. giraud . ”
christie	links	poirot spoke in a subdued tone . his crest-fallen manner seemed to delight the other . “ of all the milk and water criminals ! not an idea of defending himself . it is extraordinary ! ”
christie	links	“ so extraordinary that it gives one to think , does it not ? ” suggested poirot mildly . but giraud was not even listening . he twirled his cane amicably . “ well , good day , m. poirot . i am glad you ’ re satisfied of young renauld ’ s guilt at last . ”
christie	links	“ _pardon ! ___ but i am not in the least satisfied . jack renauld is innocent. ” giraud stared for a moment—then burst out laughing , tapping his head significantly with the brief remark : “ _toqué ! ___ ”
christie	links	poirot drew himself up . a dangerous light showed in his eyes . “ m . giraud , throughout the case your manner to me has been deliberately insulting ! you need teaching a lesson . i am prepared to wager you 500 francs that i find the murderer of m. renauld before you do . is it agreed ? ”
christie	links	giraud stared helplessly at him , and murmured again : “ _toqué ! ___ ” “ come now , ” urged poirot , “ is it agreed ? ” “ i have no wish to take your money from you. ” “ make your mind easy—you will not ! ”
christie	links	“ oh , well then , i agree ! you speak of my manner to you being insulting . _eh bien___ , once or twice , _your___ manner has annoyed _me___. ” “ i am enchanted to hear it , ” said poirot . “ good morning , m. giraud . come , hastings . ”
christie	links	i said no word as we walked along the street . my heart was heavy . poirot had displayed his intentions only too plainly . i doubted more than ever my powers of saving bella from the consequences of her act . this unlucky encounter with giraud had roused poirot and put him on his mettle .
christie	links	suddenly i felt a hand laid on my shoulder , and turned to face gabriel stonor . we stopped and greeted him , and he proposed strolling with us back to our hotel .
christie	links	“ and what are you doing here , m. stonor ? ” inquired poirot . “ one must stand by one ’ s friends , ” replied the other dryly . “ especially when they are unjustly accused. ” “ then you do not believe that jack renauld committed the crime ? ” i asked eagerly .
christie	links	“ certainly i don ’ t . i know the lad . i admit that there have been one or two things in this business that have staggered me completely , but none the less , in spite of his fool way of taking it , i ’ ll never believe that jack renauld is a murderer . ”
christie	links	my heart warmed to the secretary . his words seemed to lift a secret weight from my heart . “ i have no doubt that many people feel as you do , ” i exclaimed . “ there is really absurdly little evidence against him . i should say that there was no doubt of his acquittal—no doubt whatever . ”
christie	links	but stonor hardly responded as i could have wished . “ i ’ d give a lot to think as you do , ” he said gravely . he turned to poirot . “ what ’ s your opinion , monsieur ? ” “ i think that things look very black against him , ” said poirot quietly .
christie	links	“ you believe him guilty ? ” said stonor sharply . “ no . but i think he will find it hard to prove his innocence. ” “ he ’ s behaving so damned queerly , ” muttered stonor . “ of course i realize that there ’ s a lot more in this affair than meets the eye . giraud ’ s not wise to that because he ’ s an outsider , but the whole thing has been damned odd . as to that , least said soonest mended . if mrs. renauld wants to hush anything up , i ’ ll take my cue from her . it ’ s her show , and i ’ ve too much respect for her judgment to shove my oar in , but i can ’ t get behind this attitude of jack ’ s . any one would think he _wanted___ to be thought guilty . ”
christie	links	“ but it ’ s absurd , ” i cried , bursting in . “ for one thing , the dagger— ” i paused , uncertain as to how much poirot would wish me to reveal . i continued , choosing my words carefully , “ we know that the dagger could not have been in jack renauld ’ s possession that evening . mrs. renauld knows that . ”
christie	links	“ true , ” said stonor . “ when she recovers , she will doubtless say all this and more . well , i must be leaving you. ” “ one moment. ” poirot ’ s hand arrested his departure . “ can you arrange for word to be sent to me at once should madame renauld recover consciousness ? ”
christie	links	“ certainly . that ’ s easily done. ” “ that point about the dagger is good , poirot , ” i urged as we went upstairs . “ i couldn ’ t speak very plainly before stonor. ” “ that was quite right of you . we might as well keep the knowledge to ourselves as long as we can . as to the dagger , your point hardly helps jack renauld . you remember that i was absent for an hour this morning , before we started from london ? ”
christie	links	“ yes ? ” “ well , i was employed in trying to find the firm jack renauld employed to convert his souvenirs . it was not very difficult . _eh bien___ , hastings , they made to his order not _two___ paper-knives , but _three___ . ”
christie	links	“ so that— ? ” “ so that , after giving one to his mother , and one to bella duveen , there was a third which he doubtless retained for his own use . no , hastings , i fear the dagger question will not help us to save him from the guillotine . ”
christie	links	“ it won ’ t come to that , ” i cried , stung . poirot shook his head uncertainly . “ you will save him , ” i cried positively . poirot glanced at me dryly . “ have you not rendered it impossible , _mon ami ? ___ ”
christie	links	“ some other way , ” i muttered . “ ah ! _sapristi ! ___ but it is miracles you ask from me . no—say no more . let us instead see what is in this letter. ” and he drew out the envelope from his breast pocket .
christie	links	his face contracted as he read , then he handed the one flimsy sheet to me . “ there are other women in the world who suffer , hastings. ” the writing was blurred and the note had evidently been written in great agitation :
christie	links	“ _dear m. poirot : ___ “ if you get this , i beg of you to come to my aid . i have no one to turn to , and at all costs jack must be saved . i implore of you on my knees to help us .
christie	links	“ marthe daubreuil. ” i handed it back , moved . “ you will go ? ” “ at once . we will command an auto. ” half an hour later saw us at the villa marguerite . marthe was at the door to meet us , and led poirot in , clinging with both hands to one of his .
christie	links	“ ah , you have come—it is good of you . i have been in despair , not knowing what to do . they will not let me go to see him in prison even . i suffer horribly , i am nearly mad . is it true what they say , that he does not deny the crime ? but that is madness . it is impossible that he should have done it ! never for one minute will i believe it . ”
christie	links	“ neither do i believe it , mademoiselle , ” said poirot gently . “ but then why does he not speak ? i do not understand. ” “ perhaps because he is screening some one , ” suggested poirot , watching her .
christie	links	marthe frowned . “ screening some one ? do you mean his mother ? ah , from the beginning i have suspected her . who inherits all that vast fortune ? she does . it is easy to wear widow ’ s weeds and play the hypocrite . and they say that when he was arrested she fell down—like _that___. ” she made a dramatic gesture . “ and without doubt , m. stonor , the secretary , he helped her . they are thick as thieves , those two . it is true she is older than he—but what do men care—if a woman is rich ! ”
christie	links	there was a hint of bitterness in her tone . “ stonor was in england , ” i put in . “ he says so—but who knows ? ” “ mademoiselle , ” said poirot quietly , “ if we are to work together , you and i , we must have things clear . first , i will ask you a question . ”
christie	links	“ yes , monsieur ? ” “ are you aware of your mother ’ s real name ? ” marthe looked at him for a minute , then , letting her head fall forward on her arms , she burst into tears .
christie	links	“ there , there , ” said poirot , patting her on the shoulder . “ calm yourself , _petite___ , i see that you know . now a second question , did you know who m. renauld was ? ” “ m . renauld , ” she raised her head from her hands and gazed at him wonderingly .
christie	links	“ ah , i see you do not know that . now listen to me carefully. ” step by step , he went over the case , much as he had done to me on the day of our departure for england . marthe listened spellbound . when he had finished , she drew a long breath .
christie	links	“ but you are wonderful—magnificent ! you are the greatest detective in the world. ” with a swift gesture she slipped off her chair and knelt before him with an abandonment that was wholly french .
christie	links	“ save him , monsieur , ” she cried . “ i love him so . oh , save him , save him—save him ! ” 25 an unexpected dénouement we were present the following morning at the examination of jack renauld . short as the time had been , i was shocked at the change that had taken place in the young prisoner . his cheeks had fallen in , there were deep black circles round his eyes , and he looked haggard and distraught , as one who had wooed sleep in vain for several nights . he betrayed no emotion at seeing us .
christie	links	the prisoner and his counsel , maître grosíer , were accommodated with chairs . a formidable guard with resplendent sabre stood before the door . the patient _greffier___ sat at his desk . the examination began .
christie	links	“ renauld , ” began the magistrate , “ do you deny that you were in merlinville on the night of the crime ? ” jack did not reply at once , then he said with a hesitancy of manner which was piteous :
christie	links	“ i—i—told you that i was in cherbourg. ” maître grosíer frowned and sighed . i realized at once that jack renauld was obstinately bent on conducting his own case as he wished , to the despair of his legal representative .
christie	links	the magistrate turned sharply . “ send in the station witnesses. ” in a moment or two the door opened to admit a man whom i recognized as being a porter at merlinville station .
christie	links	“ you were on duty on the night of june 7th ? ” “ yes , monsieur. ” “ you witnessed the arrival of the 11:40 train ? ” “ yes , monsieur. ” “ look at the prisoner . do you recognize him as having been one of the passengers to alight ? ”
christie	links	“ yes , monsieur le juge. ” “ there is no possibility of your being mistaken ? ” “ no , monsieur . i knew m. jack renauld well. ” “ nor of your being mistaken as to the date ? ” “ no , monsieur . because it was the following morning , june 8th , that we heard of the murder . ”
christie	links	another railway official was brought in , and confirmed the first one ’ s evidence . the magistrate looked at jack renauld . “ these men have identified you positively . what have you to say ? ” jack shrugged his shoulders .
christie	links	“ nothing. ” m. hautet exchanged a glance with the _greffier___ , as the scratching of the latter ’ s pen recorded the answer . “ renauld , ” continued the magistrate , “ do you recognize this ? ” he took something from the table by his side , and held it out to the prisoner . i shuddered as i recognized the aeroplane dagger .
christie	links	“ pardon , ” cried maître grosíer . “ i demand to speak to my client before he answers that question. ” but jack renauld had no consideration for the feelings of the wretched grosíer . he waved him aside , and replied quietly :
christie	links	“ certainly i recognize it . it is a present given by me to my mother , as a souvenir of the war. ” “ is there , as far as you know , any duplicate of that dagger in existence ? ”
christie	links	again maître grosíer burst out , and again jack overrode him . “ not that i know of . the setting was my own design. ” even the magistrate almost gasped at the boldness of the reply . it did , in very truth , seem as though jack was rushing on his fate . i realized , of course , the vital necessity he was under of concealing , for bella ’ s sake , the fact that there was a duplicate dagger in the case . so long as there was supposed to be only one weapon , no suspicion was likely to attach to the girl who had had the second paper-knife in her possession . he was valiantly shielding the woman he had once loved—but at what a cost to himself ! i began to realize the magnitude of the task i had so lightly set poirot . it would not be easy to secure the acquittal of jack renauld , by anything short of the truth .
christie	links	m. hautet spoke again , with a peculiarly biting inflection : “ madame renauld told us that this dagger was on her dressing table on the night of the crime . but madame renauld is a mother ! it will doubtless astonish you , renauld , but i consider it highly likely that madame renauld was mistaken , and that , by inadvertence perhaps , you had taken it with you to paris . doubtless you will contradict me— ”
christie	links	i saw the lad ’ s handcuffed hands clench themselves . the perspiration stood out in beads upon his brow , as with a supreme effort he interrupted m. hautet in a hoarse voice :
christie	links	“ i shall not contradict you . it is possible. ” it was a stupefying moment . maître grosíer rose to his feet , protesting : “ my client has undergone a considerable nervous strain . i should wish it put on record that i do not consider him answerable for what he says . ”
christie	links	the magistrate quelled him angrily . for a moment a doubt seemed to arise in his own mind . jack renauld had almost overdone his part . he leaned forward , and gazed at the prisoner searchingly .
christie	links	“ do you fully understand , renauld , that on the answers you have given me i shall have no alternative but to commit you for trial ? ” jack ’ s pale face flushed . he looked steadily back .
christie	links	“ m . hautet , i swear that i did not kill my father. ” but the magistrate ’ s brief moment of doubt was over . he laughed a short , unpleasant laugh . “ without doubt , without doubt—they are always innocent , our prisoners ! by your own mouth you are condemned . you can offer no defence , no alibi—only a mere assertion which would not deceive a babe ! —that you are not guilty . you killed your father , renauld—cruel and cowardly murder—for the sake of money which you believed would come to you at his death . your mother was an accessory after the fact . doubtless , in view of the fact that she acted as a mother , the courts will extend an indulgence to her that they will not accord to you . and rightly so ! your crime was a horrible one—to be held in abhorrence by gods and men ! ” m. hautet was enjoying himself , working up his period , steeped in the solemnity of the moment , and his own role as representative of justice . “ you killed—and you must pay the consequences of your action . i speak to you , not as a man , but as justice , eternal justice , which— ”
christie	links	m. hautet was interrupted—to his intense annoyance . the door was pushed open . “ m . le juge , m. le juge , ” stammered the attendant , “ there is a lady who says—who says— ” “ who says what ? ” cried the justly incensed magistrate . “ this is highly irregular . i forbid it—i absolutely forbid it . ”
christie	links	but a slender figure pushed the stammering gendarme aside . dressed all in black , with a long veil that hid her face , she advanced into the room . my heart gave a sickening throb . she had come then ! all my efforts were in vain . yet i could not but admire the courage that had led her to take this step so unfalteringly .
christie	links	she raised her veil—and i gasped . for , though as like her as two peas , this girl was not cinderella ! on the other hand , now that i saw her without the fair wig she had worn on the stage , i recognized her as the girl of the photograph in jack renauld ’ s room .
christie	links	“ you are the juge d ’ instruction , m. hautet ? ” she queried . “ yes , but i forbid— ” “ my name is bella duveen . i wish to give myself up for the murder of mr. renauld . ”
christie	links	26 i receive a letter “ _my friend : ___ “ you will know all when you get this . nothing that i can say will move bella . she has gone out to give herself up . i am tired out with struggling . “ you will know now that i deceived you , that where you gave me trust i repaid you with lies . it will seem , perhaps , indefensible to you , but i should like , before i go out of your life for ever , to show you just how it all came about . if i knew that you forgave me , it would make life easier for me . it wasn ’ t for myself i did it—that ’ s the only thing i can put forward to say for myself . “ i ’ ll begin from the day i met you in the boat train from paris . i was uneasy then about bella . she was just desperate about jack renauld , she ’ d have lain down on the ground for him to walk on , and when he began to change , and to stop writing so often , she began getting in a state . she got it into her head that he was keen on another girl—and of course , as it turned out afterwards , she was quite right there . she ’ d made up her mind to go to their villa at merlinville , and try and see jack . she knew i was against it , and tried to give me the slip . i found she was not on the train at calais , and determined i would not go on to england without her . i ’ d an uneasy feeling that something awful was going to happen if i couldn ’ t prevent it . “ i met the next train from paris . she was on it , and set upon going out then and there to merlinville . i argued with her for all i was worth , but it wasn ’ t any good . she was all strung up and set upon having her own way . well , i washed my hands of it . i ’ d done all i could ! it was getting late . i went to an hotel , and bella started for merlinville . i still couldn ’ t shake off my feeling of what the books call ‘ impending disaster. ’ “ the next day came—but no bella . she ’ d made a date with me to meet at the hotel , but she didn ’ t keep it . no sign of her all day . i got more and more anxious . then came an evening paper with the news . “ it was awful ! i couldn ’ t be sure , of course—but i was terribly afraid . i figured it out that bella had met papa renauld and told him about her and jack , and that he ’ d insulted her or something like that . we ’ ve both got terribly quick tempers . “ then all the masked foreigner business came out , and i began to feel more at ease . but it still worried me that bella hadn ’ t kept her date with me . “ by the next morning , i was so rattled that i ’ d just got to go and see what i could . first thing , i ran up against you . you know all that… when i saw the dead man , looking so like jack , and wearing jack ’ s fancy overcoat , i knew ! and there was the identical paper-knife—wicked little thing ! —that jack had given bella ! ten to one it had her finger-marks on it . i can ’ t hope to explain to you the sort of helpless horror of that moment . i only saw one thing clearly—i must get hold of that dagger , and get right away with it before they found out it was gone . i pretended to faint , and whilst you were away getting water i took the thing and hid it away in my dress . “ i told you that i was staying at the hôtel du phare , but of course really i made a bee line back to calais , and then on to england by the first boat . when we were in mid-channel , i dropped that little devil of a dagger into the sea . then i felt i could breathe again . “ bella was at our digs in london . she looked like nothing on god ’ s earth . i told her what i ’ d done , and that she was pretty safe for the time being . she stared at me , and then began laughing… laughing… laughing… it was horrible to hear her ! i felt that the best thing to do was to keep busy . she ’ d go mad if she had time to brood on what she ’ d done . luckily we got an engagement at once . “ and then , i saw you and your friend , watching us that night… i was frantic . you must suspect , or you wouldn ’ t have tracked us down . i had to know the worst , so i followed you . i was desperate . and then , before i ’ d had time to say anything , i tumbled to it that it was _me___ you suspected , not bella ! or at least that you thought i _was___ bella since i ’ d stolen the dagger . “ i wish , honey , that you could see back into my mind at that moment… you ’ d forgive me , perhaps… i was so frightened , and muddled , and desperate.… all i could get clearly was that you would try and save me . i didn ’ t know whether you ’ d be willing to save her… i thought very likely not—it wasn ’ t the same thing ! and i couldn ’ t risk it ! bella ’ s my twin—i ’ d got to do the best for her . so i went on lying.… i felt mean—i feel mean still.… that ’ s all—enough too , you ’ ll say , i expect . i ought to have trusted you.… if i had— “ as soon as the news was in the paper that jack renauld had been arrested , it was all up . bella wouldn ’ t even wait to see how things went.… “ i ’ m very tired.… i can ’ t write any more.… ”
christie	links	she had begun to sign herself cinderella , but had crossed that out and written instead “ dulcie duveen. ” it was an ill-written , blurred epistle but i have kept it to this day .
christie	links	poirot was with me when i read it . the sheets fell from my hand , and i looked across at him . “ did you know all the time that it was—the other ? ”
christie	links	“ yes , my friend. ” “ why did you not tell me ? ” “ to begin with , i could hardly believe it conceivable that you could make such a mistake . you had seen the photograph . the sisters are very alike , but by no means incapable of distinguishment . ”
christie	links	“ but the fair hair ? ” “ a wig , worn for the sake of a piquant contrast on the stage . is it conceivable that with twins one should be fair and one dark ? ”
christie	links	“ why didn ’ t you tell me that night at the hotel in coventry ? ” “ you were rather high-handed in your methods , _mon ami___ , ” said poirot dryly . “ you did not give me a chance . ”
christie	links	“ but afterwards ? ” “ ah , afterwards ! well , to begin with , i was hurt at your want of faith in me . and then , i wanted to see whether your—feelings would stand the test of time . in fact , whether it was love , or a flash in the pan , with you . i should not have left you long in your error . ”
christie	links	i nodded . his tone was too affectionate for me to bear resentment . i looked down on the sheets of the letter . suddenly i picked them up from the floor , and pushed them across to him .
christie	links	“ read that , ” i said . “ i ’ d like you to. ” he read it through in silence , then he looked up at me . “ what is it that worries you , hastings ? ” this was quite a new mood in poirot . his mocking manner seemed laid quite aside . i was able to say what i wanted without too much difficulty .
christie	links	“ she doesn ’ t say—she doesn ’ t say—well , not whether she cares for me or not ! ” poirot turned back the pages . “ i think you are mistaken , hastings. ” “ where ? ” i cried , leaning forward eagerly .
christie	links	poirot smiled . “ she tells you that in every line of the letter , _mon ami___. ” “ but where am i to find her ? there ’ s no address on the letter . there ’ s a french stamp , that ’ s all . ”
christie	links	“ excite yourself not ! leave it to papa poirot . i can find her for you as soon as i have five little minutes ! ” 27 jack renauld ’ s story “ congratulations , m. jack , ” said poirot , wringing the lad warmly by the hand .
christie	links	young renauld had come to us as soon as he was liberated—before starting for merlinville to rejoin marthe and his mother . stonor accompanied him . his heartiness was in strong contrast to the lad ’ s wan looks . it was plain that the boy was on the verge of a nervous breakdown . although delivered from the immediate peril that was hanging over him , the circumstances of his release were too painful to let him feel full relief . he smiled mournfully at poirot , and said in a low voice :
christie	links	“ i went through it to protect her , and now it ’ s all no use ! ” “ you could hardly expect the girl to accept the price of your life , ” remarked stonor dryly . “ she was bound to come forward when she saw you heading straight for the guillotine . ”
christie	links	“ _eh ma foi ! ___ and you were heading for it too ! ” added poirot , with a slight twinkle . “ you would have had maître grosíer ’ s death from rage on your conscience if you had gone on . ”
christie	links	“ he was a well meaning ass , i suppose , ” said jack . “ but he worried me horribly . you see , i couldn ’ t very well take him into my confidence . but , my god ! what ’ s going to happen about bella ? ”
christie	links	“ if i were you , ” said poirot frankly , “ i should not distress myself unduly . the french courts are very lenient to youth and beauty , and the _crime passionnel___ . a clever lawyer will make out a great case of extenuating circumstances . it will not be pleasant for you— ”
christie	links	“ i don ’ t care about that . you see , m. poirot , in a way i _do___ feel guilty of my father ’ s murder . but for me , and my entanglement with this girl , he would be alive and well today . and then my cursed carelessness in taking away the wrong overcoat . i can ’ t help feeling responsible for his death . it will haunt me for ever ! ”
christie	links	“ no , no , ” i said soothingly . “ of course it ’ s horrible to me to think that bella killed my father , ” resumed jack , “ but i ’ d treated her shamefully . after i met marthe , and realized i ’ d made a mistake , i ought to have written and told her so honestly . but i was so terrified of a row , and of its coming to marthe ’ s ears , and her thinking there was more in it than there ever had been , that—well , i was a coward , and went on hoping the thing would die down of itself . i just drifted , in fact—not realizing that i was driving the poor kid desperate . if she ’ d really knifed me , as she meant to , i should have got no more than my deserts . and the way she ’ s come forward now is downright plucky . i ’ d have stood the racket , you know—up to the end . ”
christie	links	he was silent for a moment or two , and then burst out on another tack : “ what gets me is why the governor should be wandering about in underclothes and my overcoat at that time of night . i suppose he ’ d just given the foreign johnnies the slip , and my mother must have made a mistake about its being 2 o ’ clock when they came . or—or , it wasn ’ t all a frame up , was it ? i mean , my mother didn ’ t think—couldn ’ t think—that—that it was _me ? ___ ”
christie	links	poirot reassured him quickly . “ no , no , m. jack . have no fears on that score . as for the rest , i will explain it to you one of these days . it is rather curious . but will you recount to us exactly what did occur on that terrible evening ? ”
christie	links	“ there ’ s very little to tell . i came from cherbourg , as i told you , in order to see marthe before going to the other end of the world . the train was late , and i decided to take the short cut across the golf links . i could easily get into the grounds of the villa marguerite from there . i had nearly reached the place when— ”
christie	links	he paused and swallowed . “ yes ? ” “ i heard a terrible cry . it wasn ’ t loud—a sort of choke and gasp—but it frightened me . for a moment i stood rooted to the spot . then i came round the corner of a bush . there was moonlight . i saw the grave , and a figure lying face downwards , with a dagger sticking in the back . and then—and then—i looked up and saw _her___ . she was looking at me as though she saw a ghost—it ’ s what she must have thought me at first—all expression seemed frozen out of her face by horror . and then she gave a cry , and turned and ran . ”
christie	links	he stopped , trying to master his emotion . “ and afterwards ? ” asked poirot gently . “ i really don ’ t know . i stayed there for a time , dazed . and then i realized i ’ d better get away as fast as i could . it didn ’ t occur to me that they would suspect me , but i was afraid of being called upon to give evidence against her . i walked to st. beauvais as i told you , and got a car from there back to cherbourg . ”
christie	links	a knock came at the door , and a page entered with a telegram which he delivered to stonor . he tore it open . then he got up from his seat . “ mrs . renauld has regained consciousness , ” he said .
christie	links	“ ah ! ” poirot sprang to his feet . “ let us all go to merlinville at once ! ” a hurried departure was made forthwith . stonor , at jack ’ s instance , agreed to stay behind and do all that could be done for bella duveen . poirot , jack renauld and i set off in the renauld car .
christie	links	the run took just over forty minutes . as we approached the doorway of the villa marguerite , jack renauld shot a questioning glance at poirot . “ how would it be if you went on first—to break the news to my mother that i am free— ”
christie	links	“ while you break it in person to mademoiselle marthe , eh ? ” finished poirot , with a twinkle . “ but yes , by all means , i was about to propose such an arrangement myself. ” jack renauld did not wait for more . stopping the car , he swung himself out , and ran up the path to the front door . we went on in the car to the villa geneviève .
christie	links	“ poirot , ” i said , “ do you remember how we arrived here that first day ? and were met by the news of m. renauld ’ s murder ? ” “ ah ! yes , truly . not so long ago , either . but what a lot of things have happened since then—especially for you , _mon ami ! ___ ”
christie	links	“ poirot , what have you done about finding bel—i mean dulcie ? ” “ calm yourself , hastings . i arrange everything. ” “ you ’ re being a precious long time about it , ” i grumbled . poirot changed the subject .
christie	links	“ then the beginning , now the end , ” he moralized , as we rang the bell . “ and , considered as a case , the end is profoundly unsatisfactory. ” “ yes , indeed , ” i sighed . “ you are regarding it from the sentimental standpoint , hastings . that was not my meaning . we will hope that mademoiselle bella will be dealt with leniently , and after all jack renauld can not marry both the girls . i spoke from a professional standpoint . this is not a crime well ordered and regular , such as a detective delights in . the _mise en scène___ designed by georges conneau , that indeed is perfect , but the _dénouement___—ah , no ! a man killed by accident in a girl ’ s fit of anger—ah , indeed , what order or method is there in that ? ”
christie	links	and in the midst of a fit of laughter on my part at poirot ’ s peculiarities , the door was opened by françoise . poirot explained that he must see mrs. renauld at once , and the old woman conducted him upstairs . i remained in the _salon___ . it was some time before poirot reappeared . he was looking unusually grave .
christie	links	“ _vous voilà___ , hastings ! _sacré tonnerre___ , but there are squalls ahead ! ” “ what do you mean ? ” i cried . “ i would hardly have credited it , ” said poirot thoughtfully , “ but women are very unexpected . ”
christie	links	“ here are jack and marthe daubreuil , ” i exclaimed , looking out of the window . poirot bounded out of the room , and met the young couple on the steps outside . “ do not enter . it is better not . your mother is very upset . ”
christie	links	“ i know , i know , ” said jack renauld . “ i must go up to her at once. ” “ but no , i tell you . it is better not. ” “ but marthe and i— ” “ in any case , do not take mademoiselle with you . mount , if you must , but you would be wise to be guided by me . ”
christie	links	a voice on the stairs behind made us all start . “ i thank you for your good offices , m. poirot , but i will make my own wishes clear. ” we stared in astonishment . descending the stairs , leaning upon léonie ’ s arm , was mrs. renauld , her head still bandaged . the french girl was weeping , and imploring her mistress to return to bed .
christie	links	“ madame will kill herself . it is contrary to all the doctor ’ s orders ! ” but mrs. renauld came on . “ mother , ” cried jack , starting forward . but with a gesture she drove him back .
christie	links	“ i am no mother of yours ! you are no son of mine ! from this day and hour i renounce you. ” “ mother , ” cried the lad , stupefied . for a moment she seemed to waver , to falter before the anguish in his voice . poirot made a mediating gesture , but instantly she regained command of herself .
christie	links	“ your father ’ s blood is on your head . you are morally guilty of his death . you thwarted and defied him over this girl , and by your heartless treatment of another girl , you brought about his death . go out from my house . tomorrow i intend to take such steps as shall make it certain that you shall never touch a penny of his money . make your way in the world as best you can with the help of the girl who is the daughter of your father ’ s bitterest enemy ! ”
christie	links	and slowly , painfully , she retraced her way upstairs . we were all dumbfounded—totally unprepared for such a demonstration . jack renauld , worn out with all he had already gone through , swayed and nearly fell . poirot and i went quickly to his assistance .
christie	links	“ he is overdone , ” murmured poirot to marthe . “ where can we take him ? ” “ but home ! to the villa marguerite . we will nurse him , my mother and i . my poor jack ! ” we got the lad to the villa , where he dropped limply on to a chair in a semi-dazed condition . poirot felt his head and hands .
christie	links	“ he has fever . the long strain begins to tell . and now this shock on top of it . get him to bed , and hastings and i will summon a doctor. ” a doctor was soon procured . after examining the patient , he gave it as his opinion that it was simply a case of nerve strain . with perfect rest and quiet , the lad might be almost restored by the next day , but , if excited , there was a chance of brain fever . it would be advisable for some one to sit up all night with him .
christie	links	finally , having done all we could , we left him in the charge of marthe and her mother , and set out for the town . it was past our usual hour of dining , and we were both famished . the first restaurant we came to assuaged the pangs of hunger with an excellent _omelette___ , and an equally excellent _entrecôte___ to follow .
christie	links	“ and now for quarters for the night , ” said poirot , when at length _café noir___ had completed the meal . “ shall we try our old friend , the hôtel des bains ? ” we traced our steps there without more ado . yes , messieurs could be accommodated with two good rooms overlooking the sea . then poirot asked a question which surprised me .
christie	links	“ has an english lady , miss robinson , arrived ? ” “ yes , monsieur . she is in the little _salon___. ” “ ah ! ” “ poirot , ” i cried , keeping pace with him as he walked along the corridor , “ who on earth is miss robinson ? ”
christie	links	poirot beamed kindly on me . “ it is that i have arranged you a marriage , hastings. ” “ but , i say— ” “ bah ! ” said poirot , giving me a friendly push over the threshold of the door . “ do you think i wish to trumpet aloud in merlinville the name of duveen ? ”
christie	links	it was indeed cinderella who rose to greet us . i took her hands in both of mine . my eyes said the rest . poirot cleared his throat . “ _mes enfants___ , ” he said , “ for the moment we have no time for sentiment . there is work ahead of us . mademoiselle , were you able to do what i asked you ? ”
christie	links	in response , cinderella took from her bag an object wrapped up in paper , and handed it silently to poirot . the latter unwrapped it . i gave a start—for it was the aeroplane dagger which i understood she had cast into the sea . strange , how reluctant women always are to destroy the most compromising of objects and documents !
christie	links	“ _très bien , mon enfant___ , ” said poirot . “ i am pleased with you . go now and rest yourself . hastings here and i have work to do . you shall see him tomorrow. ” “ where are you going ? ” asked the girl , her eyes widening .
christie	links	“ you shall hear all about it tomorrow. ” “ because wherever you ’ re going , i ’ m coming too. ” “ but mademoiselle— ” “ i ’ m coming too , i tell you. ” poirot realized that it was futile to argue further . he gave in .
christie	links	“ come then , mademoiselle . but it will not be amusing . in all probability nothing will happen. ” the girl made no reply . twenty minutes later we set forth . it was quite dark now , a close , oppressive evening . poirot led the way out of the town in the direction of the villa geneviève . but when he reached the villa marguerite he paused .
christie	links	“ i should like to assure myself that all goes well with jack renauld . come with me , hastings . mademoiselle will perhaps remain outside . madame daubreuil might say something which would wound her . ”
christie	links	we unlatched the gate , and walked up the path . as we went round to the side of the house , i drew poirot ’ s attention to a window on the first floor . thrown sharply on the blind was the profile of marthe daubreuil .
christie	links	“ ah ! ” said poirot . “ i figure to myself that that is the room where we shall find jack renauld. ” madame daubreuil opened the door to us . she explained that jack was much the same , but perhaps we would like to see for ourselves . she led us upstairs and into the bedroom . marthe daubreuil was embroidering by a table with a lamp on it . she put her finger to her lips as we entered .
christie	links	jack renauld was sleeping an uneasy fitful sleep , his head turning from side to side , and his face still unduly flushed . “ is the doctor coming again ? ” asked poirot in a whisper .
christie	links	“ not unless we send . he is sleeping—that is the great thing . _maman___ made him a tisane. ” she sat down again with her embroidery as we left the room . madame daubreuil accompanied us down the stairs . since i had learned of her past history , i viewed this woman with increased interest . she stood there with her eyes cast down , the same very faint enigmatical smile that i remembered on her lips . and suddenly i felt afraid of her , as one might feel afraid of a beautiful poisonous snake .
christie	links	“ i hope we have not deranged you , madame , ” said poirot politely as she opened the door for us to pass out . “ not at all , monsieur. ” “ by the way , ” said poirot , as though struck by an afterthought , “ m . stonor has not been in merlinville today , has he ? ”
christie	links	i could not at all fathom the point of this question which i well knew to be meaningless as far as poirot was concerned . madame daubreuil replied quite composedly : “ not that i know of . ”
christie	links	“ he has not had an interview with mrs. renauld ? ” “ how should i know that , monsieur ? ” “ true , ” said poirot . “ i thought you might have seen him coming or going , that is all . good night , madame . ”
christie	links	“ why— ” i began . “ no ‘ _whys___ , ’ hastings . there will be time for that later. ” we rejoined cinderella and made our way rapidly in the direction of the villa geneviève . poirot looked over his shoulder once at the lighted window and the profile of marthe as she bent over her work .
christie	links	“ he is being guarded at all events , ” he muttered . arrived at the villa geneviève , poirot took up his stand behind some bushes to the left of the drive , where , whilst enjoying a good view ourselves , we were completely hidden from sight . the villa itself was in total darkness , everybody was without doubt in bed and asleep . we were almost immediately under the window of mrs. renauld ’ s bedroom , which window , i noticed , was open . it seemed to me that it was upon this spot that poirot ’ s eyes were fixed .
christie	links	“ what are we going to do ? ” i whispered . “ watch. ” “ but— ” “ i do not expect anything to happen for at least an hour , probably two hours , but the— ” but his words were interrupted by a long thin drawn cry :
christie	links	“ help ! ” a light flashed up in the second floor room on the right hand side of the house . the cry came from there . and even as we watched there came a shadow on the blind as of two people struggling .
christie	links	“ _mille tonnerres ! ___ ” cried poirot . “ she must have changed her room ! ” dashing forward , he battered wildly on the front door . then rushing to the tree in the flower-bed , he swarmed up it with the agility of a cat . i followed him , as with a bound he sprang in through the open window . looking over my shoulder , i saw dulcie reaching the branch behind me .
christie	links	“ take care , ” i exclaimed . “ take care of your grandmother ! ” retorted the girl . “ this is child ’ s play to me. ” poirot had rushed through the empty room and was pounding on the door leading into the corridor .
christie	links	“ locked and bolted on the outside , ” he growled . “ and it will take time to burst it open. ” the cries for help were getting noticeably fainter . i saw despair in poirot ’ s eyes . he and i together put our shoulders to the door .
christie	links	cinderella ’ s voice , calm and dispassionate , came from the window : “ you ’ ll be too late , i guess i ’ m the only one who can do anything. ” before i could move a hand to stop her , she appeared to leap upward into space . i rushed and looked out . to my horror , i saw her hanging by her hands from the roof , propelling herself along by jerks in the direction of the lighted window .
christie	links	“ good heavens ! she ’ ll be killed , ” i cried . “ you forget . she ’ s a professional acrobat , hastings . it was the providence of the good god that made her insist on coming with us tonight . i only pray that she may be in time . ah ! ”
christie	links	a cry of absolute terror floated out on to the night as the girl disappeared through the right-hand window ; then in cinderella ’ s clear tones came the words : “ no , you don ’ t ! i ’ ve got you—and my wrists are just like steel . ”
christie	links	at the same moment the door of our prison was opened cautiously by françoise . poirot brushed her aside unceremoniously and rushed down the passage to where the other maids were grouped round the further door .
christie	links	“ it ’ s locked on the inside , monsieur. ” there was the sound of a heavy fall within . after a moment or two the key turned and the door swung slowly open . cinderella , very pale , beckoned us in .
christie	links	“ she is safe ? ” demanded poirot . “ yes , i was just in time . she was exhausted. ” mrs. renauld was half sitting , half lying on the bed . she was gasping for breath . “ nearly strangled me , ” she murmured painfully . the girl picked up something from the floor and handed it to poirot . it was a rolled up ladder of silk rope , very fine but quite strong .
christie	links	“ a getaway , ” said poirot . “ by the window , whilst we were battering at the door . where is—the other ? ” the girl stood aside a little and pointed . on the ground lay a figure wrapped in some dark material a fold of which hid the face .
christie	links	“ dead ? ” she nodded . “ i think so. ” “ head must have struck the marble fender. ” “ but who is it ? ” i cried . “ the murderer of m. renauld , hastings . and the would-be murderer of madame renauld . ”
christie	links	puzzled and uncomprehending , i knelt down , and lifting the fold of cloth , looked into the dead beautiful face of marthe daubreuil ! 28 journey ’ s end i have confused memories of the further events of that night . poirot seemed deaf to my repeated questions . he was engaged in overwhelming françoise with reproaches for not having told him of mrs. renauld ’ s change of sleeping quarters .
christie	links	i caught him by the shoulder , determined to attract his attention , and make myself heard . “ but you _must___ have known , ” i expostulated . “ you were taken up to see her this afternoon . ”
christie	links	poirot deigned to attend to me for a brief moment . “ she had been wheeled on a sofa into the middle room—her boudoir , ” he explained . “ but , monsieur , ” cried françoise , “ madame changed her room almost immediately after the crime ! the associations—they were too distressing ! ”
christie	links	“ then why was i not told , ” vociferated poirot , striking the table , and working himself into a first-class passion . “ i demand you—why—was—i—not—told ? you are an old woman completely imbecile ! and léonie and denise are no better . all of you are triple idiots ! your stupidity has nearly caused the death of your mistress . but for this courageous child— ”
christie	links	he broke off , and , darting across the room to where the girl was bending over ministering to mrs. renauld , he embraced her with gallic fervour—slightly to my annoyance . i was aroused from my condition of mental fog by a sharp command from poirot to fetch the doctor immediately on mrs. renauld ’ s behalf . after that , i might summon the police . and he added , to complete my dudgeon :
christie	links	“ it will hardly be worth your while to return here . i shall be too busy to attend to you , and of mademoiselle here i make a _garde-malad___. ” i retired with what dignity i could command . having done my errands , i returned to the hotel . i understood next to nothing of what had occurred . the events of the night seemed fantastic and impossible . nobody would answer my questions . nobody had seemed to hear them . angrily , i flung myself into bed , and slept the sleep of the bewildered and utterly exhausted .
christie	links	i awoke to find the sun pouring in through the open windows and poirot , neat and smiling , sitting beside the bed . “ _enfin___ you wake ! but it is that you are a famous sleeper , hastings ! do you know that it is nearly eleven o ’ clock ? ”
christie	links	i groaned and put a hand to my head . “ i must have been dreaming , ” i said . “ do you know , i actually dreamt that we found marthe daubreuil ’ s body in mrs. renauld ’ s room , and that you declared her to have murdered mr. renauld ? ”
christie	links	“ you were not dreaming . all that is quite true. ” “ but bella duveen killed mr. renauld ? ” “ oh , no , hastings , she did not ! she said she did—yes—but that was to save the man she loved from the guillotine . ”
christie	links	“ what ? ” “ remember jack renauld ’ s story . they both arrived on the scene at the same instant , and each took the other to be the perpetrator of the crime . the girl stares at him in horror , and then with a cry rushes away . but , when she hears that the crime has been brought home to him , she can not bear it , and comes forward to accuse herself and save him from certain death . ”
christie	links	poirot leaned back in his chair , and brought the tips of his fingers together in familiar style . “ the case was not quite satisfactory to me , ” he observed judicially . “ all along i was strongly under the impression that we were dealing with a cold-blooded and premeditated crime committed by some one who had been contented ( very cleverly ) with using m. renauld ’ s own plans for throwing the police off the track . the great criminal ( as you may remember my remarking to you once ) is always supremely simple . ”
christie	links	i nodded . “ now , to support this theory , the criminal must have been fully cognizant of mr. renauld ’ s plans . that leads us to madame renauld . but facts fail to support any theory of her guilt . is there any one else who might have known of them ? yes . from marthe daubreuil ’ s own lips we have the admission that she overheard m. renauld ’ s quarrel with the tramp . if she could overhear that , there is no reason why she should not have heard everything else , especially if m. and madame renauld were imprudent enough to discuss their plans sitting on the bench . remember how easily you overheard marthe ’ s conversation with jack renauld from that spot . ”
christie	links	“ but what possible motive could marthe have for murdering mr. renauld ? ” i argued . “ what motive ? money ! m. renauld was a millionaire several times over , and at his death ( or so she and jack believed ) half that vast fortune would pass to his son . let us reconstruct the scene from the standpoint of marthe daubreuil .
christie	links	“ marthe daubreuil overhears what passes between renauld and his wife . so far he has been a nice little source of income to the daubreuil mother and daughter , but now he proposes to escape from their toils . at first , possibly , her idea is to prevent that escape . but a bolder idea takes its place , and one that fails to horrify the daughter of jeanne beroldy ! at present m. renauld stands inexorably in the way of her marriage with jack . if the latter defies his father , he will be a pauper—which is not at all to the mind of mademoiselle marthe . in fact , i doubt if she has ever cared a straw for jack renauld . she can simulate emotion , but in reality she is of the same cold , calculating type as her mother . i doubt , too , whether she was really very sure of her hold over the boy ’ s affections . she had dazzled and captivated him , but separated from her , as his father could so easily manage to separate him , she might lose him . but with m. renauld dead , and jack the heir to half his millions , the marriage can take place at once , and at a stroke she will attain wealth—not the beggarly thousands that have been extracted from him so far . and her clever brain takes in the simplicity of the thing . it is all so easy . m. renauld is planning all the circumstances of his death—she has only to step in at the right moment and turn the farce into a grim reality . and here comes in the second point which led me infallibly to marthe daubreuil—the dagger ! jack renauld had _three___ souvenirs made . one he gave to his mother , one to bella duveen ; was it not highly probable that he had given the third one to marthe daubreuil ?
christie	links	“ so then , to sum up , there were four points of note against marthe daubreuil : “ ( 1 ) marthe daubreuil could have overheard m. renauld ’ s plans . “ ( 2 ) marthe daubreuil had a direct interest in causing m. renauld ’ s death .
christie	links	“ ( 3 ) marthe daubreuil was the daughter of the notorious madame beroldy who in my opinion was morally and virtually the murderess of her husband , although it may have been georges conneau ’ s hand which struck the actual blow .
christie	links	“ ( 4 ) marthe daubreuil was the only person , besides jack renauld , likely to have the third dagger in her possession. ” poirot paused and cleared his throat . “ of course , when i learned of the existence of the other girl , bella duveen , i realized that it was quite possible that _she___ might have killed m. renauld . the solution did not commend itself to me , because , as i pointed out to you , hastings , an expert , such as i am , likes to meet a foeman worthy of his steel . still one must take crimes as one finds them , not as one would like them to be . it did not seem very likely that bella duveen would be wandering about carrying a souvenir paper-knife in her hand , but of course she might have had some idea all the time of revenging herself on jack renauld . when she actually came forward and confessed to the murder , it seemed that all was over . and yet—i was not satisfied , _mon ami___ . _i was not satisfied.…___
christie	links	“ i went over the case again minutely , and i came to the same conclusion as before . if it was _not___ bella duveen , the only other person who could have committed the crime was marthe daubreuil . but i had not one single proof against her !
christie	links	“ and then you showed me that letter from mademoiselle dulcie , and i saw a chance of settling the matter once for all . the original dagger was stolen by dulcie duveen and thrown into the sea—since , as she thought , it belonged to her sister . but if , by any chance , it was _not___ her sister ’ s , but the one given by jack to marthe daubreuil—why then , bella duveen ’ s dagger would be still intact ! i said no word to you , hastings ( it was no time for romance ) but i sought out mademoiselle dulcie , told her as much as i deemed needful , and set her to search amongst the effects of her sister . imagine my elation , when she sought me out ( according to my instructions ) as miss robinson with the precious souvenir in her possession !
christie	links	“ in the meantime i had taken steps to force mademoiselle marthe into the open . by my orders , mrs. renauld repulsed her son , and declared her intention of making a will on the morrow which should cut him off from ever enjoying even a portion of his father ’ s fortune . it was a desperate step , but a necessary one , and madame renauld was fully prepared to take the risk—though unfortunately she also never thought of mentioning her change of room . i suppose she took it for granted that i knew . all happened as i thought . marthe daubreuil made a last bold bid for the renauld millions—and failed ! ”
christie	links	“ what absolutely bewilders me , ” i said , “ is how she ever got into the house without our seeing her . it seems an absolute miracle . we left her behind at the villa marguerite , we go straight to the villa geneviève—and yet she is there before us ! ”
christie	links	“ ah , but we did not leave her behind . she was out of the villa marguerite by the back way whilst we were talking to her mother in the hall . that is where , as the americans say , she ‘ put it over ’ on hercule poirot ! ”
christie	links	“ but the shadow on the blind ? we saw it from the road. ” “ _eh bien___ , when we looked up , madame daubreuil had just had time to run upstairs and take her place . ”
christie	links	“ madame daubreuil ? ” “ yes . one is old , and one is young , one dark , and one fair , but , for the purpose of a silhouette on a blind , their profiles are singularly alike . even i did not suspect—triple imbecile that i was ! i thought i had plenty of time before me—that she would not try to gain admission to the villa until much later . she had brains , that beautiful mademoiselle marthe . ”
christie	links	“ and her object was to murder mrs. renauld ? ” “ yes . the whole fortune would then pass to her son . but it would have been suicide , _mon ami ! ___ on the floor by marthe daubreuil ’ s body , i found a pad and a little bottle of chloroform and a hypodermic syringe containing a fatal dose of morphine . you understand ? the chloroform first—then when the victim is unconscious the prick of the needle . by the morning the smell of the chloroform has quite disappeared , and the syringe lies where it has fallen from madame renauld ’ s hand . what would he say , the excellent m. hautet ? ‘ poor woman ! what did i tell you ? the shock of joy , it was too much on top of the rest ! did i not say that i should not be surprised if her brain became unhinged . altogether a most tragic case , the renauld case ! ’
christie	links	“ however , hastings , things did not go quite as mademoiselle marthe had planned . to begin with , madame renauld was awake and waiting for her . there is a struggle . but madame renauld is terribly weak still . there is a last chance for marthe daubreuil . the idea of suicide is at an end , but if she can silence madame renauld with her strong hands , make a getaway with her little silk ladder whilst we are still battering on the inside of the further door , and be back at the villa marguerite before we return there , it will be hard to prove anything against her . but she was checkmated—not by hercule poirot—but by _la petite acrobate___ with her wrists of steel . ”
christie	links	i mused over the whole story . “ when did you first begin to suspect marthe daubreuil , poirot ? when she told us she had overheard the quarrel in the garden ? ” poirot smiled .
christie	links	“ my friend , do you remember when we drove into merlinville that first day ? and the beautiful girl we saw standing at the gate ? you asked me if i had not noticed a young goddess , and i replied to you that i had seen only a girl with anxious eyes . that is how i have thought of marthe daubreuil from the beginning . _the girl with the anxious eyes ! ___ why was she anxious ? not on jack renauld ’ s behalf , for she did not know then that he had been in merlinville the previous evening . ”
christie	links	“ by the way , ” i exclaimed , “ how is jack renauld ? ” “ much better . he is still at the villa marguerite . but madame daubreuil has disappeared . the police are looking for her. ” “ was she in with her daughter , do you think ? ”
christie	links	“ we shall never know . madame is a lady who can keep her secrets . and i doubt very much if the police will ever find her. ” “ has jack renauld been—told ? ” “ not yet . ”
christie	links	“ it will be a terrible shock to him. ” “ naturally . and yet , do you know , hastings , i doubt if his heart was ever seriously engaged . so far we have looked upon bella duveen as a siren , and marthe daubreuil as the girl he really loved . but i think that if we reversed the terms we should come nearer to the truth . marthe daubreuil was very beautiful . she set herself to fascinate jack , and she succeeded , but remember his curious reluctance to break with the other girl . and see how he was willing to go to the guillotine rather than implicate her . i have a little idea that when he learns the truth he will be horrified—revolted , and his false love will wither away . ”
christie	links	“ what about giraud ? ” “ he has a _crise___ of the nerves , that one ! he has been obliged to return to paris. ” we both smiled . poirot proved a fairly true prophet . when at length the doctor pronounced jack renauld strong enough to hear the truth , it was poirot who broke it to him . the shock was indeed terrific . yet jack rallied better than i could have supposed possible . his mother ’ s devotion helped him to live through those difficult days . the mother and son were inseparable now .
christie	links	there was a further revelation to come . poirot had acquainted mrs. renauld with the fact that he knew her secret , and had represented to her that jack should not be left in ignorance of his father ’ s past .
christie	links	“ to hide the truth , never does it avail , madame ! be brave and tell him everything. ” with a heavy heart mrs. renauld consented , and her son learned that the father he had loved had been in actual fact a fugitive from justice . a halting question was promptly answered by poirot .
christie	links	“ reassure yourself , m. jack . the world knows nothing . as far as i can see , there is no obligation for me to take the police into my confidence . throughout the case i have acted , not for them , but for your father . justice overtook him at last , but no one need ever know that he and georges conneau were one and the same . ”
christie	links	there were , of course , various points in the case that remained puzzling to the police , but poirot explained things in so plausible a fashion that all query about them was gradually stilled .
christie	links	shortly after we got back to london , i noticed a magnificent model of a foxhound adorning poirot ’ s mantelpiece . in answer to my inquiring glance , poirot nodded . “ _mais , oui ! ___ i got my 500 francs ! is he not a splendid fellow ? i call him giraud ! ”
christie	links	a few days later jack renauld came to see us with a resolute expression on his face . “ m . poirot , i ’ ve come to say good-bye . i ’ m sailing for south america almost immediately . my father had large interests over the continent , and i mean to start a new life out there . ”
christie	links	“ you go alone , m. jack ? ” “ my mother comes with me—and i shall keep stonor on as my secretary . he likes out of-the-way parts of the world. ” “ no one else goes with you ? ”
christie	links	jack flushed . “ you mean— ? ” “ a girl who loves you very dearly—who has been willing to lay down her life for you. ” “ how could i ask her ? ” muttered the boy . “ after all that has happened , could i go to her and—oh , what sort of a lame story could i tell ? ”
christie	links	“ _les femmes___—they have a wonderful genius for manufacturing crutches for stories like that. ” “ yes , but—i ’ ve been such a damned fool ! ” “ so have all of us , at one time and another , ” observed poirot philosophically .
christie	links	but jack ’ s face had hardened . “ there ’ s something else . i ’ m my father ’ s son . would any one marry me , knowing that ? ” “ you are your father ’ s son , you say . hastings here will tell you that i believe in heredity— ”
christie	links	“ well , then— ” “ wait . i know a woman , a woman of courage and endurance , capable of great love , of supreme self-sacrifice— ” the boy looked up . his eyes softened . “ my mother ! ” “ yes . you are your mother ’ s son as well as your father ’ s . go then to mademoiselle bella . tell her everything . keep nothing back—and see what she will say ! ”
christie	links	jack looked irresolute . “ go to her as a boy no longer , but a man—a man bowed by the fate of the past , and the fate of today , but looking forward to a new and wonderful life . ask her to share it with you . you may not realize it , but your love for each other has been tested in the fire and not found wanting . you have both been willing to lay down your lives for each other . ”
christie	links	and what of captain arthur hastings , humble chronicler of these pages ? there is some talk of his joining the renaulds on a ranch across the seas , but for the end of this story i prefer to go back to a morning in the garden of the villa geneviève .
christie	links	“ i can ’ t call you bella , ” i said , “ since it isn ’ t your name . and dulcie seems so unfamiliar . so it ’ s got to be cinderella . cinderella married the prince , you remember . i ’ m not a prince , but— ”
christie	links	she interrupted me . “ cinderella warned him , i ’ m sure ! you see , she couldn ’ t promise to turn into a princess . she was only a little scullion after all— ” “ it ’ s the prince ’ s turn to interrupt , ” i interpolated . “ do you know what he said ? ”

melville	pierre	to greylock 's most excellent majesty . in old times authors were proud of the privilege of dedicating their works to majesty . a right noble custom , which we of berkshire must revive . for whether we will or no , majesty is all around us here in berkshire , sitting as in a grand congress of vienna of majestical hill-tops , and eternally challenging our homage .
melville	pierre	but since the majestic mountain , greylock -- my own more immediate sovereign lord and king -- hath now , for innumerable ages , been the one grand dedicatee of the earliest rays of all the berkshire mornings , i know not how his imperial purple majesty ( royal-born : porphyrogenitus ) will receive the dedication of my own poor solitary ray .

melville	pierre	pierre . book i. pierre just emerging from his teens . i . there are some strange summer mornings in the country , when he who is but a sojourner from the city shall early walk forth into the fields , and be wonder-smitten with the trance-like aspect of the green and golden world . not a flower stirs ; the trees forget to wave ; the grass itself seems to have ceased to grow ; and all nature , as if suddenly become conscious of her own profound mystery , and feeling no refuge from it but silence , sinks into this wonderful and indescribable repose .
melville	pierre	such was the morning in june , when , issuing from the embowered and high-gabled old home of his fathers , pierre , dewily refreshed and spiritualized by sleep , gayly entered the long , wide , elm-arched street of the village , and half unconsciously bent his steps toward a cottage , which peeped into view near the end of the vista .
melville	pierre	the verdant trance lay far and wide ; and through it nothing came but the brindled kine , dreamily wandering to their pastures , followed , not driven , by ruddy-cheeked , white-footed boys . as touched and bewitched by the loveliness of this silence , pierre neared the cottage , and lifted his eyes , he swiftly paused , fixing his glance upon one upper , open casement there . why now this impassioned , youthful pause ? why this enkindled cheek and eye ? upon the sill of the casement , a snow-white glossy pillow reposes , and a trailing shrub has softly rested a rich , crimson flower against it .
melville	pierre	well mayst thou seek that pillow , thou odoriferous flower , thought pierre ; not an hour ago , her own cheek must have rested there . `` lucy ! '' `` pierre ! '' as heart rings to heart those voices rang , and for a moment , in the bright hush of the morning , the two stood silently but ardently eying each other , beholding mutual reflections of a boundless admiration and love .
melville	pierre	`` nothing but pierre , '' laughed the youth , at last ; `` thou hast forgotten to bid me good-morning . '' `` that would be little . good-mornings , good-evenings , good days , weeks , months , and years to thee , pierre ; -- bright pierre ! -- pierre ! ''
melville	pierre	truly , thought the youth , with a still gaze of inexpressible fondness ; truly the skies do ope , and this invoking angel looks down. -- '' i would return thee thy manifold good-mornings , lucy , did not that presume thou had'st lived through a night ; and by heaven , thou belong'st to the regions of an infinite day ! ''
melville	pierre	`` fie , now , pierre ; why should ye youths always swear when ye love ! '' `` because in us love is profane , since it mortally reaches toward the heaven in ye ! '' `` there thou fly'st again , pierre ; thou art always circumventing me so . tell me , why should ye youths ever show so sweet an expertness in turning all trifles of ours into trophies of yours ? ''
melville	pierre	`` i know not how that is , but ever was it our fashion to do . '' and shaking the casement shrub , he dislodged the flower , and conspicuously fastened it in his bosom. -- '' i must away now , lucy ; see ! under these colors i march . ''
melville	pierre	`` bravissimo ! oh , my only recruit ! '' ii . pierre was the only son of an affluent , and haughty widow ; a lady who externally furnished a singular example of the preservative and beautifying influences of unfluctuating rank , health , and wealth , when joined to a fine mind of medium culture , uncankered by any inconsolable grief , and never worn by sordid cares . in mature age , the rose still miraculously clung to her cheek ; litheness had not yet completely uncoiled itself from her waist , nor smoothness unscrolled itself from her brow , nor diamondness departed from her eyes . so that when lit up and bediademed by ball-room lights , mrs. glendinning still eclipsed far younger charms , and had she chosen to encourage them , would have been followed by a train of infatuated suitors , little less young than her own son pierre .
melville	pierre	but a reverential and devoted son seemed lover enough for this widow bloom ; and besides all this , pierre when namelessly annoyed , and sometimes even jealously transported by the too ardent admiration of the handsome youths , who now and then , caught in unintended snares , seemed to entertain some insane hopes of wedding this unattainable being ; pierre had more than once , with a playful malice , openly sworn , that the man -- gray-beard , or beardless -- who should dare to propose marriage to his mother , that man would by some peremptory unrevealed agency immediately disappear from the earth .
melville	pierre	this romantic filial love of pierre seemed fully returned by the triumphant maternal pride of the widow , who in the clear-cut lineaments and noble air of the son , saw her own graces strangely translated into the opposite sex . there was a striking personal resemblance between them ; and as the mother seemed to have long stood still in her beauty , heedless of the passing years ; so pierre seemed to meet her half-way , and by a splendid precocity of form and feature , almost advanced himself to that mature stand-point in time , where his pedestaled mother so long had stood . in the playfulness of their unclouded love , and with that strange license which a perfect confidence and mutual understanding at all points , had long bred between them , they were wont to call each other brother and sister . both in public and private this was their usage ; nor when thrown among strangers , was this mode of address ever suspected for a sportful assumption ; since the amaranthiness of mrs. glendinning fully sustained this youthful pretension. -- thus freely and lightsomely for mother and son flowed on the pure joined current of life . but as yet the fair river had not borne its waves to those sideways repelling rocks , where it was thenceforth destined to be forever divided into two unmixing streams .
melville	pierre	an excellent english author of these times enumerating the prime advantages of his natal lot , cites foremost , that he first saw the rural light . so with pierre . it had been his choice fate to have been born and nurtured in the country , surrounded by scenery whose uncommon loveliness was the perfect mould of a delicate and poetic mind ; while the popular names of its finest features appealed to the proudest patriotic and family associations of the historic line of glendinning . on the meadows which sloped away from the shaded rear of the manorial mansion , far to the winding river , an indian battle had been fought , in the earlier days of the colony , and in that battle the paternal great-grandfather of pierre , mortally wounded , had sat unhorsed on his saddle in the grass , with his dying voice , still cheering his men in the fray . this was saddle-meadows , a name likewise extended to the mansion and the village . far beyond these plains , a day 's walk for pierre , rose the storied heights , where in the revolutionary war his grandfather had for several months defended a rude but all-important stockaded fort , against the repeated combined assaults of indians , tories , and regulars . from before that fort , the gentlemanly , but murderous half-breed , brandt , had fled , but had survived to dine with general glendinning , in the amicable times which followed that vindictive war . all the associations of saddle-meadows were full of pride to pierre . the glendinning deeds by which their estate had so long been held , bore the cyphers of three indian kings , the aboriginal and only conveyancers of those noble woods and plains . thus loftily , in the days of his circumscribed youth , did pierre glance along the background of his race ; little recking of that maturer and larger interior development , which should forever deprive these things of their full power of pride in his soul .
melville	pierre	but the breeding of pierre would have been unwisely contracted , had his youth been unintermittingly passed in these rural scenes . at a very early period he had begun to accompany his father and mother -- and afterwards his mother alone -- in their annual visits to the city ; where naturally mingling in a large and polished society , pierre had insensibly formed himself in the airier graces of life , without enfeebling the vigor derived from a martial race , and fostered in the country 's clarion air .
melville	pierre	nor while thus liberally developed in person and manners , was pierre deficient in a still better and finer culture . not in vain had he spent long summer afternoons in the deep recesses of his father 's fastidiously picked and decorous library ; where the spenserian nymphs had early led him into many a maze of all-bewildering beauty . thus , with a graceful glow on his limbs , and soft , imaginative flames in his heart , did this pierre glide toward maturity , thoughtless of that period of remorseless insight , when all these delicate warmths should seem frigid to him , and he should madly demand more ardent fires .
melville	pierre	nor had that pride and love which had so bountifully provided for the youthful nurture of pierre , neglected his culture in the deepest element of all . it had been a maxim with the father of pierre , that all gentlemanhood was vain ; all claims to it preposterous and absurd , unless the primeval gentleness and golden humanities of religion had been so thoroughly wrought into the complete texture of the character , that he who pronounced himself gentleman , could also rightfully assume the meek , but kingly style of christian . at the age of sixteen , pierre partook with his mother of the holy sacraments .
melville	pierre	it were needless , and more difficult , perhaps , to trace out precisely the absolute motives which prompted these youthful vows . enough , that as to pierre had descended the numerous other noble qualities of his ancestors ; and as he now stood heir to their forests and farms ; so by the same insensible sliding process , he seemed to have inherited their docile homage to a venerable faith , which the first glendinning had brought over sea , from beneath the shadow of an english minister . thus in pierre was the complete polished steel of the gentleman , girded with religion 's silken sash ; and his great-grandfather 's soldierly fate had taught him that the generous sash should , in the last bitter trial , furnish its wearer with glory 's shroud ; so that what through life had been worn for grace 's sake , in death might safely hold the man . but while thus all alive to the beauty and poesy of his father 's faith , pierre little foresaw that this world hath a secret deeper than beauty , and life some burdens heavier than death .
melville	pierre	so perfect to pierre had long seemed the illuminated scroll of his life thus far , that only one hiatus was discoverable by him in that sweetly-writ manuscript . a sister had been omitted from the text . he mourned that so delicious a feeling as fraternal love had been denied him . nor could the fictitious title , which he so often lavished upon his mother , at all supply the absent reality . this emotion was most natural ; and the full cause and reason of it even pierre did not at that time entirely appreciate . for surely a gentle sister is the second best gift to a man ; and it is first in point of occurrence ; for the wife comes after . he who is sisterless , is as a bachelor before his time . for much that goes to make up the deliciousness of a wife , already lies in the sister .
melville	pierre	`` oh , had my father but had a daughter ! '' cried pierre ; `` some one whom i might love , and protect , and fight for , if need be . it must be a glorious thing to engage in a mortal quarrel on a sweet sister 's behalf ! now , of all things , would to heaven , i had a sister ! ''
melville	pierre	thus , ere entranced in the gentler bonds of a lover ; thus often would pierre invoke heaven for a sister ; but pierre did not then know , that if there be any thing a man might well pray against , that thing is the responsive gratification of some of the devoutest prayers of his youth .
melville	pierre	it may have been that this strange yearning of pierre for a sister , had part of its origin in that still stranger feeling of loneliness he sometimes experienced , as not only the solitary head of his family , but the only surnamed male glendinning extant . a powerful and populous family had by degrees run off into the female branches ; so that pierre found himself surrounded by numerous kinsmen and kinswomen , yet companioned by no surnamed male glendinning , but the duplicate one reflected to him in the mirror . but in his more wonted natural mood , this thought was not wholly sad to him . nay , sometimes it mounted into an exultant swell . for in the ruddiness , and flushfulness , and vain-gloriousness of his youthful soul , he fondly hoped to have a monopoly of glory in capping the fame-column , whose tall shaft had been erected by his noble sires .
melville	pierre	in all this , how unadmonished was our pierre by that foreboding and prophetic lesson taught , not less by palmyra 's quarries , than by palmyra 's ruins . among those ruins is a crumbling , uncompleted shaft , and some leagues off , ages ago left in the quarry , is the crumbling corresponding capital , also incomplete . these time seized and spoiled ; these time crushed in the egg ; and the proud stone that should have stood among the clouds , time left abased beneath the soil . oh , what quenchless feud is this , that time hath with the sons of men !
melville	pierre	iii . it has been said that the beautiful country round about pierre appealed to very proud memories . but not only through the mere chances of things , had that fine country become ennobled by the deeds of his sires , but in pierre 's eyes , all its hills and swales seemed as sanctified through their very long uninterrupted possession by his race .
melville	pierre	that fond ideality which , in the eyes of affection , hallows the least trinket once familiar to the person of a departed love ; with pierre that talisman touched the whole earthly landscape about him ; for remembering that on those hills his own fine fathers had gazed ; through those woods , over these lawns , by that stream , along these tangled paths , many a grand-dame of his had merrily strolled when a girl ; vividly recalling these things , pierre deemed all that part of the earth a love-token ; so that his very horizon was to him as a memorial ring .
melville	pierre	the monarchical world very generally imagines , that in demagoguical america the sacred past hath no fixed statues erected to it , but all things irreverently seethe and boil in the vulgar caldron of an everlasting uncrystalizing present . this conceit would seem peculiarly applicable to the social condition . with no chartered aristocracy , and no law of entail , how can any family in america imposingly perpetuate itself ? certainly that common saying among us , which declares , that be a family conspicuous as it may , a single half-century shall see it abased ; that maxim undoubtedly holds true with the commonalty . in our cities families rise and burst like bubbles in a vat . for indeed the democratic element operates as a subtile acid among us ; forever producing new things by corroding the old ; as in the south of france verdigris , the primitive material of one kind of green paint , is produced by grape-vinegar poured upon copper plates . now in general nothing can be more significant of decay than the idea of corrosion ; yet on the other hand , nothing can more vividly suggest luxuriance of life , than the idea of green as a color ; for green is the peculiar signet of all-fertile nature herself . herein by apt analogy we behold the marked anomalousness of america ; whose character abroad , we need not be surprised , is misconceived , when we consider how strangely she contradicts all prior notions of human things ; and how wonderfully to her , death itself becomes transmuted into life . so that political institutions , which in other lands seem above all things intensely artificial , with america seem to possess the divine virtue of a natural law ; for the most mighty of nature 's laws is this , that out of death she brings life .
melville	pierre	still , are there things in the visible world , over which ever-shifting nature hath not so unbounded a sway . the grass is annually changed ; but the limbs of the oak , for a long term of years , defy that annual decree . and if in america the vast mass of families be as the blades of grass , yet some few there are that stand as the oak ; which , instead of decaying , annually puts forth new branches ; whereby time , instead of subtracting , is made to capitulate into a multiple virtue .
melville	pierre	in this matter we will -- not superciliously , but in fair spirit -- compare pedigrees with england , and strange as it may seem at the first blush , not without some claim to equality . i dare say , that in this thing the peerage book is a good statistical standard whereby to judge her ; since the compilers of that work can not be entirely insensible on whose patronage they most rely ; and the common intelligence of our own people shall suffice to judge us . but the magnificence of names must not mislead us as to the humility of things . for as the breath in all our lungs is hereditary , and my present breath at this moment , is further descended than the body of the present high priest of the jews , so far as he can assuredly trace it ; so mere names , which are also but air , do likewise revel in this endless descendedness . but if richmond , and st. albans , and grafton , and portland , and buccleugh , be names almost old as england herself , the present dukes of those names stop in their own genuine pedigrees at charles ii. , and there find no very fine fountain ; since what we would deem the least glorious parentage under the sun , is precisely the parentage of a buccleugh , for example ; whose ancestress could not well avoid being a mother , it is true , but had accidentally omitted the preliminary rite . yet a king was the sire . then only so much the worse ; for if it be small insult to be struck by a pauper , but mortal offense to receive a blow from a gentleman , then of all things the bye-blows of kings must be signally unflattering . in england the peerage is kept alive by incessant restorations and creations . one man , george iii. , manufactured five hundred and twenty-two peers . an earldom , in abeyance for five centuries , has suddenly been assumed by some commoner , to whom it had not so much descended , as through the art of the lawyers been made flexibly to bend in that direction . for not thames is so sinuous in his natural course , not the bridgewater canal more artificially conducted , than blood in the veins of that winding or manufactured nobility . perishable as stubble , and fungous as the fungi , those grafted families successively live and die on the eternal soil of a name . in england this day , twenty-five hundred peerages are extinct ; but the names survive . so that the empty air of a name is more endurable than a man , or than dynasties of men ; the air fills man 's lungs and puts life into a man , but man fills not the air , nor puts life into that .
melville	pierre	all honor to the names then , and all courtesy to the men ; but if st. albans tell me he is all-honorable and all-eternal , i must still politely refer him to nell gwynne .
melville	pierre	beyond charles ii . very few indeed -- hardly worthy of note -- are the present titled english families which can trace any thing like a direct unvitiated blood-descent from the thief knights of the norman . beyond charles ii . their direct genealogies seem vain as though some jew clothesman , with a tea-canister on his head , turned over the first chapter of st. matthew to make out his unmingled participation in the blood of king saul , who had long died ere the career of the cæsar began .
melville	pierre	now , not preliminarily to enlarge upon the fact that , while in england an immense mass of state-masonry is brought to bear as a buttress in upholding the hereditary existence of certain houses , while with us nothing of that kind can possibly be admitted ; and to omit all mention of the hundreds of unobtrusive families in new england who , nevertheless , might easily trace their uninterrupted english lineage to a time before charles the blade : not to speak of the old and oriental-like english planter families of virginia and the south ; the randolphs for example , one of whose ancestors , in king james ' time , married pocahontas the indian princess , and in whose blood therefore an underived aboriginal royalty was flowing over two hundred years ago ; consider those most ancient and magnificent dutch manors at the north , whose perches are miles -- whose meadows overspread adjacent countries -- and whose haughty rent-deeds are held by their thousand farmer tenants , so long as grass grows and water runs ; which hints of a surprising eternity for a deed , and seem to make lawyer 's ink unobliterable as the sea . some of those manors are two centuries old ; and their present patrons or lords will show you stakes and stones on their estates put there -- the stones at least -- before nell gwynne the duke-mother was born , and genealogies which , like their own river , hudson , flow somewhat farther and straighter than the serpentine brooklet in hyde park .
melville	pierre	these far-descended dutch meadows lie steeped in a hindooish haze ; an eastern patriarchalness sways its mild crook over pastures , whose tenant flocks shall there feed , long as their own grass grows , long as their own water shall run . such estates seem to defy time 's tooth , and by conditions which take hold of the indestructible earth seem to contemporize their fee-simples with eternity . unimaginable audacity of a worm that but crawls through the soil he so imperially claims !
melville	pierre	in midland counties of england they boast of old oaken dining-halls where three hundred men-at-arms could exercise of a rainy afternoon , in the reign of the plantagenets . but our lords , the patroons , appeal not to the past , but they point to the present . one will show you that the public census of a county is but part of the roll of his tenants . ranges of mountains , high as ben nevis or snowdon , are their walls ; and regular armies , with staffs of officers , crossing rivers with artillery , and marching through primeval woods , and threading vast rocky defiles , have been sent out to distrain upon three thousand farmer-tenants of one landlord , at a blow . a fact most suggestive two ways ; both whereof shall be nameless here .
melville	pierre	but whatever one may think of the existence of such mighty lordships in the heart of a republic , and however we may wonder at their thus surviving , like indian mounds , the revolutionary flood ; yet survive and exist they do , and are now owned by their present proprietors , by as good nominal title as any peasant owns his father 's old hat , or any duke his great-uncle 's old coronet .
melville	pierre	for all this , then , we shall not err very widely if we humbly conceive , that -- should she choose to glorify herself in that inconsiderable way -- our america will make out a good general case with england in this short little matter of large estates , and long pedigrees -- pedigrees i mean , wherein is no flaw .
melville	pierre	iv . in general terms we have been thus decided in asserting the great genealogical and real-estate dignity of some families in america , because in so doing we poetically establish the richly aristocratic condition of master pierre glendinning , for whom we have before claimed some special family distinction . and to the observant reader the sequel will not fail to show , how important is this circumstance , considered with reference to the singularly developed character and most singular life-career of our hero . nor will any man dream that the last chapter was merely intended for a foolish bravado , and not with a solid purpose in view .
melville	pierre	now pierre stands on this noble pedestal ; we shall see if he keeps that fine footing ; we shall see if fate hath not just a little bit of a small word or two to say in this world . but it is not laid down here that the glendinnings dated back beyond pharaoh , or the deeds of saddle-meadows to the three magi in the gospels . nevertheless , those deeds , as before hinted , did indeed date back to three kings -- indian kings -- only so much the finer for that .
melville	pierre	but if pierre did not date back to the pharaohs , and if the english farmer hampdens were somewhat the seniors of even the oldest glendinning ; and if some american manors boasted a few additional years and square miles over his , yet think you that it is at all possible , that a youth of nineteen should -- merely by way of trial of the thing -- strew his ancestral kitchen hearth-stone with wheat in the stalk , and there standing in the chimney thresh out that grain with a flail , whose aerial evolutions had free play among all that masonry ; were it not impossible for such a flailer so to thresh wheat in his own ancestral kitchen chimney without feeling just a little twinge or two of what one might call family pride ? i should say not .
melville	pierre	or how think you it would be with this youthful pierre , if every day descending to breakfast , he caught sight of an old tattered british banner or two , hanging over an arched window in his hall ; and those banners captured by his grandfather , the general , in fair fight ? or how think you it would be if every time he heard the band of the military company of the village , he should distinctly recognize the peculiar tap of a british kettle-drum also captured by his grandfather in fair fight , and afterwards suitably inscribed on the brass and bestowed upon the saddle-meadows artillery corps ? or how think you it would be , if sometimes of a mild meditative fourth of july morning in the country , he carried out with him into the garden by way of ceremonial cane , a long , majestic , silver-tipped staff , a major-general 's baton , once wielded on the plume-nodding and musket-flashing review by the same grandfather several times here-in-before mentioned ? i should say that considering pierre was quite young and very unphilosophical as yet , and withal rather high-blooded ; and sometimes read the history of the revolutionary war , and possessed a mother who very frequently made remote social allusions to the epaulettes of the major-general his grandfather ; -- i should say that upon all of these occasions , the way it must have been with him , was a very proud , elated sort of way . and if this seem but too fond and foolish in pierre ; and if you tell me that this sort of thing in him showed him no sterling democrat , and that a truly noble man should never brag of any arm but his own ; then i beg you to consider again that this pierre was but a youngster as yet . and believe me you will pronounce pierre a thoroughgoing democrat in time ; perhaps a little too radical altogether to your fancy .
melville	pierre	in conclusion , do not blame me if i here make repetition , and do verbally quote my own words in saying that _it had been the choice fate of pierre to have been born and bred in the country_ . for to a noble american youth this indeed -- more than in any other land -- this indeed is a most rare and choice lot . for it is to be observed , that while in other countries , the finest families boast of the country as their home ; the more prominent among us , proudly cite the city as their seat . too often the american that himself makes his fortune , builds him a great metropolitan house , in the most metropolitan street of the most metropolitan town . whereas a european of the same sort would thereupon migrate into the country . that herein the european hath the better of it , no poet , no philosopher , and no aristocrat will deny . for the country is not only the most poetical and philosophical , but it is the most aristocratic part of this earth , for it is the most venerable , and numerous bards have ennobled it by many fine titles . whereas the town is the more plebeian portion : which , besides many other things , is plainly evinced by the dirty unwashed face perpetually worn by the town ; but the country , like any queen , is ever attended by scrupulous lady 's maids in the guise of the seasons , and the town hath but one dress of brick turned up with stone ; but the country hath a brave dress for every week in the year ; sometimes she changes her dress twenty-four times in the twenty-four hours ; and the country weareth her sun by day as a diamond on a queen 's brow ; and the stars by night as necklaces of gold beads ; whereas the town 's sun is smoky paste , and no diamond , and the town 's stars are pinchbeck and not gold .
melville	pierre	in the country then nature planted our pierre ; because nature intended a rare and original development in pierre . never mind if hereby she proved ambiguous to him in the end ; nevertheless , in the beginning she did bravely . she blew her wind-clarion from the blue hills , and pierre neighed out lyrical thoughts , as at the trumpet-blast , a war-horse paws himself into a lyric of foam . she whispered through her deep groves at eve , and gentle whispers of humanness , and sweet whispers of love , ran through pierre 's thought-veins , musical as water over pebbles . she lifted her spangled crest of a thickly-starred night , and forth at that glimpse of their divine captain and lord , ten thousand mailed thoughts of heroicness started up in pierre 's soul , and glared round for some insulted good cause to defend .
melville	pierre	so the country was a glorious benediction to young pierre ; we shall see if that blessing pass from him as did the divine blessing from the hebrews ; we shall yet see again , i say , whether fate hath not just a little bit of a word or two to say in this world ; we shall see whether this wee little bit scrap of latinity be very far out of the way -- _nemo contra deum nisi deus ipse._
melville	pierre	v. `` sister mary , '' said pierre , returned from his sunrise stroll , and tapping at his mother 's chamber door : -- '' do you know , sister mary , that the trees which have been up all night , are all abroad again this morning before you ? -- do you not smell something like coffee , my sister ? ''
melville	pierre	a light step moved from within toward the door ; which opened , showing mrs. glendinning , in a resplendently cheerful morning robe , and holding a gay wide ribbon in her hand . `` good morning , madam , '' said pierre , slowly , and with a bow , whose genuine and spontaneous reverence amusingly contrasted with the sportive manner that had preceded it . for thus sweetly and religiously was the familiarity of his affections bottomed on the profoundest filial respect .
melville	pierre	`` good afternoon to you , pierre , for i suppose it is afternoon . but come , you shall finish my toilette ; -- here , brother -- '' reaching the ribbon -- '' now acquit yourself bravely -- '' and seating herself away from the glass , she awaited the good offices of pierre .
melville	pierre	`` first lady in waiting to the dowager duchess glendinning , '' laughed pierre , as bowing over before his mother , he gracefully passed the ribbon round her neck , simply crossing the ends in front .
melville	pierre	`` well , what is to hold it there , pierre ? '' `` i am going to try and tack it with a kiss , sister , -- there ! -- oh , what a pity that sort of fastening wo n't always hold ! -- where 's the cameo with the fawns , i gave you last night ? -- ah ! on the slab -- you were going to wear it then ? -- thank you , my considerate and most politic sister -- there ! -- but stop -- here 's a ringlet gone romping -- so now , dear sister , give that assyrian toss to your head . ''
melville	pierre	the haughtily happy mother rose to her feet , and as she stood before the mirror to criticize her son 's adornings , pierre , noticing the straggling tie of her slipper , knelt down and secured it . `` and now for the urn , '' he cried , `` madam ! '' and with a humorous gallantry , offering his arm to his mother , the pair descended to breakfast .
melville	pierre	with mrs. glendinning it was one of those spontaneous maxims , which women sometimes act upon without ever thinking of , never to appear in the presence of her son in any dishabille that was not eminently becoming . her own independent observation of things , had revealed to her many very common maxims , which often become operatively lifeless from a vicarious reception of them . she was vividly aware how immense was that influence , which , even in the closest ties of the heart , the merest appearances make upon the mind . and as in the admiring love and graceful devotion of pierre lay now her highest joy in life ; so she omitted no slightest trifle which could possibly contribute to the preservation of so sweet and flattering a thing .
melville	pierre	besides all this , mary glendinning was a woman , and with more than the ordinary vanity of women -- if vanity it can be called -- which in a life of nearly fifty years had never betrayed her into a single published impropriety , or caused her one known pang at the heart . moreover , she had never yearned for admiration ; because that was her birthright by the eternal privilege of beauty ; she had always possessed it ; she had not to turn her head for it , since spontaneously it always encompassed her . vanity , which in so many women approaches to a spiritual vice , and therefore to a visible blemish ; in her peculiar case -- and though possessed in a transcendent degree -- was still the token of the highest health ; inasmuch as never knowing what it was to yearn for its gratification , she was almost entirely unconscious of possessing it at all . many women carry this light of their lives flaming on their foreheads ; but mary glendinning unknowingly bore hers within . through all the infinite traceries of feminine art , she evenly glowed like a vase which , internally illuminated , gives no outward sign of the lighting flame , but seems to shine by the very virtue of the exquisite marble itself . but that bluff corporeal admiration , with which some ball-room women are content , was no admiration to the mother of pierre . not the general homage of men , but the selected homage of the noblest men , was what she felt to be her appropriate right . and as her own maternal partialities were added to , and glorified the rare and absolute merits of pierre ; she considered the voluntary allegiance of his affectionate soul , the representative fealty of the choicest guild of his race . thus , though replenished through all her veins with the subtlest vanity , with the homage of pierre alone she was content .
melville	pierre	but as to a woman of sense and spirit , the admiration of even the noblest and most gifted man , is esteemed as nothing , so long as she remains conscious of possessing no directly influencing and practical sorcery over his soul ; and as notwithstanding all his intellectual superiority to his mother , pierre , through the unavoidable weakness of inexperienced and unexpanded youth , was strangely docile to the maternal tuitions in nearly all the things which thus far had any ways interested or affected him ; therefore it was , that to mary glendinning this reverence of pierre was invested with all the proudest delights and witcheries of self-complacency , which it is possible for the most conquering virgin to feel . still more . that nameless and infinitely delicate aroma of inexpressible tenderness and attentiveness which , in every refined and honorable attachment , is cotemporary with the courtship , and precedes the final banns and the rite ; but which , like the _bouquet_ of the costliest german wines , too often evaporates upon pouring love out to drink , in the disenchanting glasses of the matrimonial days and nights ; this highest and airiest thing in the whole compass of the experience of our mortal life ; this heavenly evanescence -- still further etherealized in the filial breast -- was for mary glendinning , now not very far from her grand climacteric , miraculously revived in the courteous lover-like adoration of pierre .
melville	pierre	altogether having its origin in a wonderful but purely fortuitous combination of the happiest and rarest accidents of earth ; and not to be limited in duration by that climax which is so fatal to ordinary love ; this softened spell which still wheeled the mother and son in one orbit of joy , seemed a glimpse of the glorious possibility , that the divinest of those emotions , which are incident to the sweetest season of love , is capable of an indefinite translation into many of the less signal relations of our many chequered life . in a detached and individual way , it seemed almost to realize here below the sweet dreams of those religious enthusiasts , who paint to us a paradise to come , when etherealized from all drosses and stains , the holiest passion of man shall unite all kindreds and climes in one circle of pure and unimpairable delight .
melville	pierre	vi . there was one little uncelestial trait , which , in the opinion of some , may mar the romantic merits of the gentlemanly pierre glendinning . he always had an excellent appetite , and especially for his breakfast . but when we consider that though pierre 's hands were small , and his ruffles white , yet his arm was by no means dainty , and his complexion inclined to brown ; and that he generally rose with the sun , and could not sleep without riding his twenty , or walking his twelve miles a day , or felling a fair-sized hemlock in the forest , or boxing , or fencing , or boating , or performing some other gymnastical feat ; when we consider these athletic habitudes of pierre , and the great fullness of brawn and muscle they built round about him ; all of which manly brawn and muscle , three times a day loudly clamored for attention ; we shall very soon perceive that to have a bountiful appetite , was not only no vulgar reproach , but a right royal grace and honor to pierre ; attesting him a man and a gentleman ; for a thoroughly developed gentleman is always robust and healthy ; and robustness and health are great trencher-men .
melville	pierre	so when pierre and his mother descended to breakfast , and pierre had scrupulously seen her supplied with whatever little things were convenient to her ; and had twice or thrice ordered the respectable and immemorial dates , the servitor , to adjust and re-adjust the window-sashes , so that no unkind current of air should take undue liberties with his mother 's neck ; after seeing to all this , but in a very quiet and inconspicuous way ; and also after directing the unruffled dates , to swing out , horizontally into a particular light , a fine joyous painting , in the good-fellow , flemish style ( which painting was so attached to the wall as to be capable of that mode of adjusting ) , and furthermore after darting from where he sat a few invigorating glances over the river-meadows to the blue mountains beyond ; pierre made a masonic sort of mysterious motion to the excellent dates , who in automaton obedience thereto , brought from a certain agreeable little side-stand , a very prominent-looking cold pasty ; which , on careful inspection with the knife , proved to be the embossed savory nest of a few uncommonly tender pigeons of pierre 's own shooting .
melville	pierre	`` sister mary , '' said he , lifting on his silver trident one of the choicest of the many fine pigeon morsels ; `` sister mary , '' said he , `` in shooting these pigeons , i was very careful to bring down one in such a manner that the breast is entirely unmarred . it was intended for you ! and here it is . now sergeant dates , help hither your mistress ' plate . no ? -- nothing but the crumbs of french rolls , and a few peeps into a coffee-cup -- is that a breakfast for the daughter of yonder bold general ? '' -- pointing to a full-length of his gold-laced grandfather on the opposite wall . `` well , pitiable is my case when i have to breakfast for two . dates ! ''
melville	pierre	`` sir . '' `` remove that toast-rack , dates ; and this plate of tongue , and bring the rolls nearer , and wheel the stand farther off , good dates . '' having thus made generous room for himself , pierre commenced operations , interrupting his mouthfuls by many sallies of mirthfulness .
melville	pierre	`` you seem to be in prodigious fine spirits this morning , brother pierre , '' said his mother . `` yes , very tolerable ; at least i ca n't say , that i am low-spirited exactly , sister mary ; -- dates , my fine fellow , bring me three bowls of milk . ''
melville	pierre	`` one bowl , sir , you mean , '' said dates , gravely and imperturbably . as the servitor left the room , mrs. glendinning spoke . `` my dear pierre , how often have i begged you never to permit your hilariousness to betray you into overstepping the exact line of propriety in your intercourse with servants . dates ' look was a respectful reproof to you just now . you must not call dates , _my fine fellow_ . he _is_ a fine fellow , a very fine fellow , indeed ; but there is no need of telling him so at my table . it is very easy to be entirely kind and pleasant to servants , without the least touch of any shade of transient good-fellowship with them . ''
melville	pierre	`` well , sister , no doubt you are altogether right ; after this i shall drop the _fine_ , and call dates nothing but _fellow_ ; -- fellow , come here ! -- how will that answer ? '' `` not at all , pierre -- but you are a romeo , you know , and so for the present i pass over your nonsense . ''
melville	pierre	`` romeo ! oh , no . i am far from being romeo -- '' sighed pierre . `` i laugh , but he cried ; poor romeo ! alas romeo ! woe is me , romeo ! he came to a very deplorable end , did romeo , sister mary . ''
melville	pierre	`` it was his own fault though . '' `` poor romeo ! '' `` he was disobedient to his parents . '' `` alas romeo ! '' `` he married against their particular wishes . '' `` woe is me , romeo ! '' `` but you , pierre , are going to be married before long , i trust , not to a capulet , but to one of our own montagues ; and so romeo 's evil fortune will hardly be yours . you will be happy . ''
melville	pierre	`` the more miserable romeo ! '' `` do n't be so ridiculous , brother pierre ; so you are going to take lucy that long ride among the hills this morning ? she is a sweet girl ; a most lovely girl . ''
melville	pierre	`` yes , that is rather my opinion , sister mary. -- by heavens , mother , the five zones hold not such another ! she is -- yes -- though i say it -- dates ! -- he 's a precious long time getting that milk ! '' `` let him stay. -- do n't be a milk-sop , pierre ! ''
melville	pierre	`` ha ! my sister is a little satirical this morning . i comprehend . '' `` never rave , pierre ; and never rant . your father never did either ; nor is it written of socrates ; and both were very wise men . your father was profoundly in love -- that i know to my certain knowledge -- but i never heard him rant about it . he was always exceedingly gentlemanly : and gentlemen never rant . milk-sops and muggletonians rant , but gentlemen never . ''
melville	pierre	`` thank you , sister. -- there , put it down , dates ; are the horses ready ? '' `` just driving round , sir , i believe . '' `` why , pierre , '' said his mother , glancing out at the window , `` are you going to santa fe de bogota with that enormous old phaeton ; -- what do you take that juggernaut out for ? ''
melville	pierre	`` humor , sister , humor ; i like it because it 's old-fashioned , and because the seat is such a wide sofa of a seat , and finally because a young lady by the name of lucy tartan cherishes a high regard for it . she vows she would like to be married in it . ''
melville	pierre	`` well , pierre , all i have to say , is , be sure that christopher puts the coach-hammer and nails , and plenty of cords and screws into the box . and you had better let him follow you in one of the farm wagons , with a spare axle and some boards . ''
melville	pierre	`` no fear , sister ; no fear ; -- i shall take the best of care of the old phaeton . the quaint old arms on the panel , always remind me who it was that first rode in it . ''
melville	pierre	`` i am glad you have that memory , brother pierre . '' `` and who it was that _next_ rode in it . '' `` bless you ! -- god bless you , my dear son ! -- always think of him and you can never err ; yes , always think of your dear perfect father , pierre . ''
melville	pierre	`` well , kiss me now , dear sister , for i must go . '' `` there ; this is my cheek , and the other is lucy 's ; though now that i look at them both , i think that hers is getting to be the most blooming ; sweeter dews fall on that one , i suppose . ''
melville	pierre	pierre laughed , and ran out of the room , for old christopher was getting impatient . his mother went to the window and stood there . `` a noble boy , and docile '' -- she murmured -- '' he has all the frolicsomeness of youth , with little of its giddiness . and he does not grow vain-glorious in sophomorean wisdom . i thank heaven i sent him not to college . a noble boy , and docile . a fine , proud , loving , docile , vigorous boy . pray god , he never becomes otherwise to me . his little wife , that is to be , will not estrange him from me ; for she too is docile , -- beautiful , and reverential , and most docile . seldom yet have i known such blue eyes as hers , that were not docile , and would not follow a bold black one , as two meek blue-ribboned ewes , follow their martial leader . how glad am i that pierre loves her so , and not some dark-eyed haughtiness , with whom i could never live in peace ; but who would be ever setting her young married state before my elderly widowed one , and claiming all the homage of my dear boy -- the fine , proud , loving , docile , vigorous boy ! -- the lofty-minded , well-born , noble boy ; and with such sweet docilities ! see his hair ! he does in truth illustrate that fine saying of his father 's , that as the noblest colts , in three points -- abundant hair , swelling chest , and sweet docility -- should resemble a fine woman , so should a noble youth . well , good-bye , pierre , and a merry morning to ye ! ''
melville	pierre	so saying she crossed the room , and -- resting in a corner -- her glad proud eye met the old general 's baton , which the day before in one of his frolic moods pierre had taken from its accustomed place in the pictured-bannered hall . she lifted it , and musingly swayed it to and fro ; then paused , and staff-wise rested with it in her hand . her stately beauty had ever somewhat martial in it ; and now she looked the daughter of a general , as she was ; for pierre 's was a double revolutionary descent . on both sides he sprang from heroes .
melville	pierre	`` this is his inheritance -- this symbol of command ! and i swell out to think it . yet but just now i fondled the conceit that pierre was so sweetly docile ! here sure is a most strange inconsistency ! for is sweet docility a general 's badge ? and is this baton but a distaff then ? -- here 's something widely wrong . now i almost wish him otherwise than sweet and docile to me , seeing that it must be hard for man to be an uncompromising hero and a commander among his race , and yet never ruffle any domestic brow . pray heaven he show his heroicness in some smooth way of favoring fortune , not be called out to be a hero of some dark hope forlorn ; -- of some dark hope forlorn , whose cruelness makes a savage of a man . give him , o god , regardful gales ! fan him with unwavering prosperities ! so shall he remain all docility to me , and yet prove a haughty hero to the world ! ''
melville	pierre	book ii . love , delight , and alarm . i . on the previous evening , pierre had arranged with lucy the plan of a long winding ride , among the hills which stretched around to the southward from the wide plains of saddle-meadows .
melville	pierre	though the vehicle was a sexagenarian , the animals that drew it , were but six-year colts . the old phaeton had outlasted several generations of its drawers . pierre rolled beneath the village elms in billowy style , and soon drew up before the white cottage door . flinging his reins upon the ground he entered the house .
melville	pierre	the two colts were his particular and confidential friends ; born on the same land with him , and fed with the same corn , which , in the form of indian-cakes , pierre himself was often wont to eat for breakfast . the same fountain that by one branch supplied the stables with water , by another supplied pierre 's pitcher . they were a sort of family cousins to pierre , those horses ; and they were splendid young cousins ; very showy in their redundant manes and mighty paces , but not at all vain or arrogant . they acknowledged pierre as the undoubted head of the house of glendinning . they well knew that they were but an inferior and subordinate branch of the glendinnings , bound in perpetual feudal fealty to its headmost representative . therefore , these young cousins never permitted themselves to run from pierre ; they were impatient in their paces , but very patient in the halt . they were full of good-humor too , and kind as kittens .
melville	pierre	`` bless me , how can you let them stand all alone that way , pierre , '' cried lucy , as she and pierre stepped forth from the cottage door , pierre laden with shawls , parasol , reticule , and a small hamper .
melville	pierre	`` wait a bit , '' cried pierre , dropping his load ; `` i will show you what my colts are . '' so saying , he spoke to them mildly , and went close up to them , and patted them . the colts neighed ; the nigh colt neighing a little jealously , as if pierre had not patted impartially . then , with a low , long , almost inaudible whistle , pierre got between the colts , among the harness . whereat lucy started , and uttered a faint cry , but pierre told her to keep perfectly quiet , for there was not the least danger in the world . and lucy did keep quiet ; for somehow , though she always started when pierre seemed in the slightest jeopardy , yet at bottom she rather cherished a notion that pierre bore a charmed life , and by no earthly possibility could die from her , or experience any harm , when she was within a thousand leagues .
melville	pierre	pierre , still between the horses , now stepped upon the pole of the phaeton ; then stepping down , indefinitely disappeared , or became partially obscured among the living colonnade of the horses ' eight slender and glossy legs . he entered the colonnade one way , and after a variety of meanderings , came out another way ; during all of which equestrian performance , the two colts kept gayly neighing , and good-humoredly moving their heads perpendicularly up and down ; and sometimes turning them sideways toward lucy ; as much as to say -- we understand young master ; we understand him , miss ; never fear , pretty lady : why , bless your delicious little heart , we played with pierre before you ever did .
melville	pierre	`` are you afraid of their running away now , lucy ? '' said pierre , returning to her . `` not much , pierre ; the superb fellows ! why , pierre , they have made an officer of you -- look ! '' and she pointed to two foam-flakes epauletting his shoulders . `` bravissimo again ! i called you my recruit , when you left my window this morning , and here you are promoted . ''
melville	pierre	`` very prettily conceited , lucy . but see , you do n't admire their coats ; they wear nothing but the finest genoa velvet , lucy . see ! did you ever see such well-groomed horses ? '' `` never ! '' `` then what say you to have them for my groomsmen , lucy ? glorious groomsmen they would make , i declare . they should have a hundred ells of white favors all over their manes and tails ; and when they drew us to church , they would be still all the time scattering white favors from their mouths , just as they did here on me . upon my soul , they shall be my groomsmen , lucy . stately stags ! playful dogs ! heroes , lucy . we shall have no marriage bells ; they shall neigh for us , lucy ; we shall be wedded to the martial sound of job 's trumpeters , lucy . hark ! they are neighing now to think of it . ''
melville	pierre	`` neighing at your lyrics , pierre . come , let us be off . here , the shawl , the parasol , the basket : what are you looking at them so for ? '' `` i was thinking , lucy , of the sad state i am in . not six months ago , i saw a poor affianced fellow , an old comrade of mine , trudging along with his lucy tartan , a hillock of bundles under either arm ; and i said to myself -- there goes a sumpter , now ; poor devil , he 's a lover . and now look at me ! well , life 's a burden , they say ; why not be burdened cheerily ? but look ye , lucy , i am going to enter a formal declaration and protest before matters go further with us . when we are married , i am not to carry any bundles , unless in cases of real need ; and what is more , when there are any of your young lady acquaintances in sight , i am not to be unnecessarily called upon to back up , and load for their particular edification . ''
melville	pierre	`` now i am really vexed with you , pierre ; that is the first ill-natured innuendo i ever heard from you . are there any of my young lady acquaintances in sight now , i should like to know ? ''
melville	pierre	`` six of them , right over the way , '' said pierre ; `` but they keep behind the curtains . i never trust your solitary village streets , lucy . sharp-shooters behind every clap-board , lucy . '' `` pray , then , dear pierre , do let us be off ! ''
melville	pierre	ii . while pierre and lucy are now rolling along under the elms , let it be said who lucy tartan was . it is needless to say that she was a beauty ; because chestnut-haired , bright-cheeked youths like pierre glendinning , seldom fall in love with any but a beauty . and in the times to come , there must be -- as in the present times , and in the times gone by -- some splendid men , and some transcendent women ; and how can they ever be , unless always , throughout all time , here and there , a handsome youth weds with a handsome maid !
melville	pierre	but though owing to the above-named provisions of dame nature , there always will be beautiful women in the world ; yet the world will never see another lucy tartan . her cheeks were tinted with the most delicate white and red , the white predominating . her eyes some god brought down from heaven ; her hair was danae 's , spangled with jove 's shower ; her teeth were dived for in the persian sea .
melville	pierre	if long wont to fix his glance on those who , trudging through the humbler walks of life , and whom unequal toil and poverty deform ; if that man shall haply view some fair and gracious daughter of the gods , who , from unknown climes of loveliness and affluence , comes floating into sight , all symmetry and radiance ; how shall he be transported , that in a world so full of vice and misery as ours , there should yet shine forth this visible semblance of the heavens . for a lovely woman is not entirely of this earth . her own sex regard her not as such . a crowd of women eye a transcendent beauty entering a room , much as though a bird from arabia had lighted on the window sill . say what you will , their jealousy -- if any -- is but an afterbirth to their open admiration . do men envy the gods ? and shall women envy the goddesses ? a beautiful woman is born queen of men and women both , as mary stuart was born queen of scots , whether men or women . all mankind are her scots ; her leal clans are numbered by the nations . a true gentleman in kentucky would cheerfully die for a beautiful woman in hindostan , though he never saw her . yea , count down his heart in death-drops for her ; and go to pluto , that she might go to paradise . he would turn turk before he would disown an allegiance hereditary to all gentlemen , from the hour their grand master , adam , first knelt to eve .
melville	pierre	a plain-faced queen of spain dwells not in half the glory a beautiful milliner does . her soldiers can break heads , but her highness can not crack a heart ; and the beautiful milliner might string hearts for necklaces . undoubtedly , beauty made the first queen . if ever again the succession to the german empire should be contested , and one poor lame lawyer should present the claims of the first excellingly beautiful woman he chanced to see -- she would thereupon be unanimously elected empress of the holy roman german empire ; -- that is to say , if all the germans were true , free-hearted and magnanimous gentlemen , at all capable of appreciating so immense an honor .
melville	pierre	it is nonsense to talk of france as the seat of all civility . did not those french heathen have a salique law ? three of the most bewitching creatures , -- immortal flowers of the line of valois -- were excluded from the french throne by that infamous provision . france , indeed ! whose catholic millions still worship mary queen of heaven ; and for ten generations refused cap and knee to many angel maries , rightful queens of france . here is cause for universal war . see how vilely nations , as well as men , assume and wear unchallenged the choicest titles , however without merit . the americans , and not the french , are the world 's models of chivalry . our salique law provides that universal homage shall be paid all beautiful women . no man 's most solid rights shall weigh against her airiest whims . if you buy the best seat in the coach , to go and consult a doctor on a matter of life and death , you shall cheerfully abdicate that best seat , and limp away on foot , if a pretty woman , traveling , shake one feather from the stage-house door .
melville	pierre	now , since we began by talking of a certain young lady that went out riding with a certain youth ; and yet find ourselves , after leading such a merry dance , fast by a stage-house window ; -- this may seem rather irregular sort of writing . but whither indeed should lucy tartan conduct us , but among mighty queens , and all other creatures of high degree ; and finally set us roaming , to see whether the wide world can match so fine a wonder . by immemorial usage , am i not bound to celebrate this lucy tartan ? who shall stay me ? is she not my hero 's own affianced ? what can be gainsaid ? where underneath the tester of the night sleeps such another ?
melville	pierre	yet , how would lucy tartan shrink from all this noise and clatter ! she is bragged of , but not brags . thus far she hath floated as stilly through this life , as thistle-down floats over meadows . noiseless , she , except with pierre ; and even with him she lives through many a panting hush . oh , those love-pauses that they know -- how ominous of their future ; for pauses precede the earthquake , and every other terrible commotion ! but blue be their sky awhile , and lightsome all their chat , and frolicsome their humors .
melville	pierre	never shall i get down the vile inventory ! how , if with paper and with pencil i went out into the starry night to inventorize the heavens ? who shall tell stars as teaspoons ? who shall put down the charms of lucy tartan upon paper ?
melville	pierre	and for the rest ; her parentage , what fortune she would possess , how many dresses in her wardrobe , and how many rings upon her fingers ; cheerfully would i let the genealogists , tax-gatherers , and upholsterers attend to that . my proper province is with the angelical part of lucy . but as in some quarters , there prevails a sort of prejudice against angels , who are merely angels and nothing more ; therefore i shall martyrize myself , by letting such gentlemen and ladies into some details of lucy tartan 's history .
melville	pierre	she was the daughter of an early and most cherished friend of pierre 's father . but that father was now dead , and she resided an only daughter with her mother , in a very fine house in the city . but though her home was in the city , her heart was twice a year in the country . she did not at all love the city and its empty , heartless , ceremonial ways . it was very strange , but most eloquently significant of her own natural angelhood that , though born among brick and mortar in a sea-port , she still pined for unbaked earth and inland grass . so the sweet linnet , though born inside of wires in a lady 's chamber on the ocean coast , and ignorant all its life of any other spot ; yet , when spring-time comes , it is seized with flutterings and vague impatiences ; it can not eat or drink for these wild longings . though unlearned by any experience , still the inspired linnet divinely knows that the inland migrating time has come . and just so with lucy in her first longings for the verdure . every spring those wild flutterings shook her ; every spring , this sweet linnet girl did migrate inland . oh god grant that those other and long after nameless flutterings of her inmost soul , when all life was become weary to her -- god grant , that those deeper flutterings in her were equally significant of her final heavenly migration from this heavy earth .
melville	pierre	it was fortunate for lucy that her aunt lanyllyn -- a pensive , childless , white-turbaned widow -- possessed and occupied a pretty cottage in the village of saddle meadows ; and still more fortunate , that this excellent old aunt was very partial to her , and always felt a quiet delight in having lucy near her . so aunt lanyllyn 's cottage , in effect , was lucy 's . and now , for some years past , she had annually spent several months at saddle meadows ; and it was among the pure and soft incitements of the country that pierre first had felt toward lucy the dear passion which now made him wholly hers .
melville	pierre	lucy had two brothers ; one her senior , by three years , and the other her junior by two . but these young men were officers in the navy ; and so they did not permanently live with lucy and her mother .
melville	pierre	mrs. tartan was mistress of an ample fortune . she was , moreover , perfectly aware that such was the fact , and was somewhat inclined to force it upon the notice of other people , nowise interested in the matter . in other words , mrs. tartan , instead of being daughter-proud , for which she had infinite reason , was a little inclined to being purse-proud , for which she had not the slightest reason ; seeing that the great mogul probably possessed a larger fortune than she , not to speak of the shah of persia and baron rothschild , and a thousand other millionaires ; whereas , the grand turk , and all their other majesties of europe , asia , and africa to boot , could not , in all their joint dominions , boast so sweet a girl as lucy . nevertheless , mrs. tartan was an excellent sort of lady , as this lady-like world goes . she subscribed to charities , and owned five pews in as many churches , and went about trying to promote the general felicity of the world , by making all the handsome young people of her acquaintance marry one another . in other words , she was a match-maker -- not a lucifer match-maker -- though , to tell the truth , she may have kindled the matrimonial blues in certain dissatisfied gentlemen 's breasts , who had been wedded under her particular auspices , and by her particular advice . rumor said -- but rumor is always fibbing -- that there was a secret society of dissatisfied young husbands , who were at the pains of privately circulating handbills among all unmarried young strangers , warning them against the insidious approaches of mrs. tartan ; and , for reference , named themselves in cipher . but this could not have been true ; for , flushed with a thousand matches -- burning blue or bright , it made little matter -- mrs. tartan sailed the seas of fashion , causing all topsails to lower to her ; and towing flotillas of young ladies , for all of whom she was bound to find the finest husband harbors in the world .
melville	pierre	but does not match-making , like charity , begin at home ? why is her own daughter lucy without a mate ? but not so fast ; mrs. tartan years ago laid out that sweet programme concerning pierre and lucy ; but in this case , her programme happened to coincide , in some degree , with a previous one in heaven , and only for that cause did it come to pass , that pierre glendinning was the proud elect of lucy tartan . besides , this being a thing so nearly affecting herself , mrs. tartan had , for the most part , been rather circumspect and cautious in all her manoeuvrings with pierre and lucy . moreover , the thing demanded no manoeuvring at all . the two platonic particles , after roaming in quest of each other , from the time of saturn and ops till now ; they came together before mrs. tartan 's own eyes ; and what more could mrs. tartan do toward making them forever one and indivisible ? once , and only once , had a dim suspicion passed through pierre 's mind , that mrs. tartan was a lady thimble-rigger , and slyly rolled the pea .
melville	pierre	in their less mature acquaintance , he was breakfasting with lucy and her mother in the city , and the first cup of coffee had been poured out by mrs. tartan , when she declared she smelt matches burning somewhere in the house , and she must see them extinguished . so banning all pursuit , she rose to seek for the burning matches , leaving the pair alone to interchange the civilities of the coffee ; and finally sent word to them , from above stairs , that the matches , or something else , had given her a headache , and begged lucy to send her up some toast and tea , for she would breakfast in her own chamber that morning .
melville	pierre	upon this , pierre looked from lucy to his boots , and as he lifted his eyes again , saw anacreon on the sofa on one side of him , and moore 's melodies on the other , and some honey on the table , and a bit of white satin on the floor , and a sort of bride 's veil on the chandelier .
melville	pierre	never mind though -- thought pierre , fixing his gaze on lucy -- i 'm entirely willing to be caught , when the bait is set in paradise , and the bait is such an angel . again he glanced at lucy , and saw a look of infinite subdued vexation , and some unwonted pallor on her cheek . then willingly he would have kissed the delicious bait , that so gently hated to be tasted in the trap . but glancing round again , and seeing that the music , which mrs. tartan , under the pretense of putting in order , had been adjusting upon the piano ; seeing that this music was now in a vertical pile against the wall , with -- '' _love was once a little boy_ , '' for the outermost and only visible sheet ; and thinking this to be a remarkable coincidence under the circumstances ; pierre could not refrain from a humorous smile , though it was a very gentle one , and immediately repented of , especially as lucy seeing and interpreting it , immediately arose , with an unaccountable , indignant , angelical , adorable , and all-persuasive `` mr . glendinning ? '' utterly confounded in him the slightest germ of suspicion as to lucy 's collusion in her mother 's imagined artifices .
melville	pierre	indeed , mrs. tartan 's having any thing whatever to do , or hint , or finesse in this matter of the loves of pierre and lucy , was nothing less than immensely gratuitous and sacrilegious . would mrs. tartan doctor lilies when they blow ? would mrs. tartan set about match-making between the steel and magnet ? preposterous mrs. tartan ! but this whole world is a preposterous one , with many preposterous people in it ; chief among whom was mrs. tartan , match-maker to the nation .
melville	pierre	this conduct of mrs. tartan , was the more absurd , seeing that she could not but know that mrs. glendinning desired the thing . and was not lucy wealthy ? -- going to be , that is , very wealthy when her mother died ; -- ( sad thought that for mrs. tartan ) -- and was not her husband 's family of the best ; and had not lucy 's father been a bosom friend of pierre 's father ? and though lucy might be matched to some one man , where among women was the match for lucy ? exceedingly preposterous mrs. tartan ! but when a lady like mrs. tartan has nothing positive and useful to do , then she will do just such preposterous things as mrs. tartan did .
melville	pierre	well , time went on ; and pierre loved lucy , and lucy , pierre ; till at last the two young naval gentlemen , her brothers , happened to arrive in mrs. tartan 's drawing-room , from their first cruise -- a three years ' one up the mediterranean . they rather stared at pierre , finding him on the sofa , and lucy not very remote .
melville	pierre	`` pray , be seated , gentlemen , '' said pierre . `` plenty of room . '' `` my darling brothers ! '' cried lucy , embracing them . `` my darling brothers and sister ! '' cried pierre , folding them together . `` pray , hold off , sir , '' said the elder brother , who had served as a passed midshipman for the last two weeks . the younger brother retreated a little , and clapped his hand upon his dirk , saying , `` sir , we are from the mediterranean . sir , permit me to say , this is decidedly improper ! who may you be , sir ? ''
melville	pierre	`` i ca n't explain for joy , '' cried pierre , hilariously embracing them all again . `` most extraordinary ! '' cried the elder brother , extricating his shirt-collar from the embrace , and pulling it up vehemently . `` draw ! '' cried the younger , intrepidly .
melville	pierre	`` peace , foolish fellows , '' cried lucy -- '' this is your old play-fellow , pierre glendinning . '' `` pierre ? why , pierre ? '' cried the lads -- '' a hug all round again ! you 've grown a fathom ! -- who would have known you ? but , then -- lucy ? i say , lucy ? -- what business have you here in this -- eh ? eh ? -- hugging-match , i should call it ? ''
melville	pierre	`` oh ! lucy do n't mean any thing , '' cried pierre -- '' come , one more all round . '' so they all embraced again ; and that evening it was publicly known that pierre was to wed with lucy .
melville	pierre	whereupon , the young officers took it upon themselves to think -- though they by no means presumed to breathe it -- that they had authoritatively , though indirectly , accelerated a before ambiguous and highly incommendable state of affairs between the now affianced lovers .
melville	pierre	iii . in the fine old robust times of pierre 's grandfather , an american gentleman of substantial person and fortune spent his time in a somewhat different style from the green-house gentlemen of the present day . the grandfather of pierre measured six feet four inches in height ; during a fire in the old manorial mansion , with one dash of his foot , he had smitten down an oaken door , to admit the buckets of his negro slaves ; pierre had often tried on his military vest , which still remained an heirloom at saddle meadows , and found the pockets below his knees , and plenty additional room for a fair-sized quarter-cask within its buttoned girth ; in a night-scuffle in the wilderness before the revolutionary war , he had annihilated two indian savages by making reciprocal bludgeons of their heads . and all this was done by the mildest hearted , and most blue-eyed gentleman in the world , who , according to the patriarchal fashion of those days , was a gentle , white-haired worshiper of all the household gods ; the gentlest husband , and the gentlest father ; the kindest of masters to his slaves ; of the most wonderful unruffledness of temper ; a serene smoker of his after-dinner pipe ; a forgiver of many injuries ; a sweet-hearted , charitable christian ; in fine , a pure , cheerful , child-like , blue-eyed , divine old man ; in whose meek , majestic soul , the lion and the lamb embraced -- fit image of his god .
melville	pierre	never could pierre look upon his fine military portrait without an infinite and mournful longing to meet his living aspect in actual life . the majestic sweetness of this portrait was truly wonderful in its effects upon any sensitive and generous-minded young observer . for such , that portrait possessed the heavenly persuasiveness of angelic speech ; a glorious gospel framed and hung upon the wall , and declaring to all people , as from the mount , that man is a noble , god-like being , full of choicest juices ; made up of strength and beauty .
melville	pierre	now , this grand old pierre glendinning was a great lover of horses ; but not in the modern sense , for he was no jockey ; -- one of his most intimate friends of the masculine gender was a huge , proud , gray horse , of a surprising reserve of manner , his saddle-beast ; he had his horses ' mangers carved like old trenchers , out of solid maple logs ; the key of the corn-bin hung in his library ; and no one grained his steeds , but himself ; unless his absence from home promoted moyar , an incorruptible and most punctual old black , to that honorable office . he said that no man loved his horses , unless his own hands grained them . every christmas he gave them brimming measures . `` i keep christmas with my horses , '' said grand old pierre . this grand old pierre always rose at sunrise ; washed his face and chest in the open air ; and then , returning to his closet , and being completely arrayed at last , stepped forth to make a ceremonious call at his stables , to bid his very honorable friends there a very good and joyful morning . woe to cranz , kit , douw , or any other of his stable slaves , if grand old pierre found one horse unblanketed , or one weed among the hay that filled their rack . not that he ever had cranz , kit , douw , or any of them flogged -- a thing unknown in that patriarchal time and country -- but he would refuse to say his wonted pleasant word to them ; and that was very bitter to them , for cranz , kit , douw , and all of them , loved grand old pierre , as his shepherds loved old abraham .
melville	pierre	what decorous , lordly , gray-haired steed is this ? what old chaldean rides abroad ? -- 't is grand old pierre ; who , every morning before he eats , goes out promenading with his saddle-beast ; nor mounts him , without first asking leave . but time glides on , and grand old pierre grows old : his life 's glorious grape now swells with fatness ; he has not the conscience to saddle his majestic beast with such a mighty load of manliness . besides , the noble beast himself is growing old , and has a touching look of meditativeness in his large , attentive eyes . leg of man , swears grand old pierre , shall never more bestride my steed ; no more shall harness touch him ! then every spring he sowed a field with clover for his steed ; and at mid-summer sorted all his meadow grasses , for the choicest hay to winter him ; and had his destined grain thrashed out with a flail , whose handle had once borne a flag in a brisk battle , into which this same old steed had pranced with grand old pierre ; one waving mane , one waving sword !
melville	pierre	now needs must grand old pierre take a morning drive ; he rides no more with the old gray steed . he has a phaeton built , fit for a vast general , in whose sash three common men might hide . doubled , trebled are the huge s shaped leather springs ; the wheels seem stolen from some mill ; the canopied seat is like a testered bed . from beneath the old archway , not one horse , but two , every morning now draw forth old pierre , as the chinese draw their fat god josh , once every year from out his fane .
melville	pierre	but time glides on , and a morning comes , when the phaeton emerges not ; but all the yards and courts are full ; helmets line the ways ; sword-points strike the stone steps of the porch ; muskets ring upon the stairs ; and mournful martial melodies are heard in all the halls . grand old pierre is dead ; and like a hero of old battles , he dies on the eve of another war ; ere wheeling to fire on the foe , his platoons fire over their old commander 's grave ; in a. d. 1812 , died grand old pierre . the drum that beat in brass his funeral march , was a british kettle-drum , that had once helped beat the vain-glorious march , for the thirty thousand predestined prisoners , led into sure captivity by that bragging boy , burgoyne .
melville	pierre	next day the old gray steed turned from his grain ; turned round , and vainly whinnied in his stall . by gracious moyar 's hand , he refuses to be patted now ; plain as horse can speak , the old gray steed says -- '' i smell not the wonted hand ; where is grand old pierre ? grain me not , and groom me not ; -- where is grand old pierre ? ''
melville	pierre	he sleeps not far from his master now ; beneath the field he cropt , he has softly lain him down ; and long ere this , grand old pierre and steed have passed through that grass to glory .
melville	pierre	but his phaeton -- like his plumed hearse , outlives the noble load it bore . and the dark bay steeds that drew grand old pierre alive , and by his testament drew him dead , and followed the lordly lead of the led gray horse ; those dark bay steeds are still extant ; not in themselves or in their issue ; but in the two descendants of stallions of their own breed . for on the lands of saddle meadows , man and horse are both hereditary ; and this bright morning pierre glendinning , grandson of grand old pierre , now drives forth with lucy tartan , seated where his own ancestor had sat , and reining steeds , whose great-great-great-grandfathers grand old pierre had reined before .
melville	pierre	how proud felt pierre : in fancy 's eye , he saw the horse-ghosts a-tandem in the van ; `` these are but wheelers '' -- cried young pierre -- '' the leaders are the generations . '' iv . but love has more to do with his own possible and probable posterities , than with the once living but now impossible ancestries in the past . so pierre 's glow of family pride quickly gave place to a deeper hue , when lucy bade love 's banner blush out from his cheek .
melville	pierre	that morning was the choicest drop that time had in his vase . ineffable distillations of a soft delight were wafted from the fields and hills . fatal morning that , to all lovers unbetrothed ; `` come to your confessional , '' it cried . `` behold our airy loves , '' the birds chirped from the trees ; far out at sea , no more the sailors tied their bowline-knots ; their hands had lost their cunning ; will they , nill they , love tied love-knots on every spangled spar .
melville	pierre	oh , praised be the beauty of this earth , the beauty , and the bloom , and the mirthfulness thereof ! the first worlds made were winter worlds ; the second made , were vernal worlds ; the third , and last , and perfectest , was this summer world of ours . in the cold and nether spheres , preachers preach of earth , as we of paradise above . oh , there , my friends , they say , they have a season , in their language known as summer . then their fields spin themselves green carpets ; snow and ice are not in all the land ; then a million strange , bright , fragrant things powder that sward with perfumes ; and high , majestic beings , dumb and grand , stand up with outstretched arms , and hold their green canopies over merry angels -- men and women -- who love and wed , and sleep and dream , beneath the approving glances of their visible god and goddess , glad-hearted sun , and pensive moon !
melville	pierre	oh , praised be the beauty of this earth ; the beauty , and the bloom , and the mirthfulness thereof . we lived before , and shall live again ; and as we hope for a fairer world than this to come ; so we came from one less fine . from each successive world , the demon principle is more and more dislodged ; he is the accursed clog from chaos , and thither , by every new translation , we drive him further and further back again . hosannahs to this world ! so beautiful itself , and the vestibule to more . out of some past egypt , we have come to this new canaan ; and from this new canaan , we press on to some circassia . though still the villains , want and woe , followed us out of egypt , and now beg in canaan 's streets : yet circassia 's gates shall not admit them ; they , with their sire , the demon principle , must back to chaos , whence they came .
melville	pierre	love was first begot by mirth and peace , in eden , when the world was young . the man oppressed with cares , he can not love ; the man of gloom finds not the god . so , as youth , for the most part , has no cares , and knows no gloom , therefore , ever since time did begin , youth belongs to love . love may end in grief and age , and pain and need , and all other modes of human mournfulness ; but love begins in joy . love 's first sigh is never breathed , till after love hath laughed . love laughs first , and then sighs after . love has not hands , but cymbals ; love 's mouth is chambered like a bugle , and the instinctive breathings of his life breathe jubilee notes of joy !
melville	pierre	that morning , two bay horses drew two laughs along the road that led to the hills from saddle meadows . apt time they kept ; pierre glendinning 's young , manly tenor , to lucy tartan 's girlish treble .
melville	pierre	wondrous fair of face , blue-eyed , and golden-haired , the bright blonde , lucy , was arrayed in colors harmonious with the heavens . light blue be thy perpetual color , lucy ; light blue becomes thee best -- such the repeated azure counsel of lucy tartan 's mother . on both sides , from the hedges , came to pierre the clover bloom of saddle meadows , and from lucy 's mouth and cheek came the fresh fragrance of her violet young being .
melville	pierre	`` smell i the flowers , or thee ? '' cried pierre . `` see i lakes , or eyes ? '' cried lucy , her own gazing down into his soul , as two stars gaze down into a tarn .
melville	pierre	no cornwall miner ever sunk so deep a shaft beneath the sea , as love will sink beneath the floatings of the eyes . love sees ten million fathoms down , till dazzled by the floor of pearls . the eye is love 's own magic glass , where all things that are not of earth , glide in supernatural light . there are not so many fishes in the sea , as there are sweet images in lovers ' eyes . in those miraculous translucencies swim the strange eye-fish with wings , that sometimes leap out , instinct with joy ; moist fish-wings wet the lover 's cheek . love 's eyes are holy things ; therein the mysteries of life are lodged ; looking in each other 's eyes , lovers see the ultimate secret of the worlds ; and with thrills eternally untranslatable , feel that love is god of all . man or woman who has never loved , nor once looked deep down into their own lover 's eyes , they know not the sweetest and the loftiest religion of this earth . love is both creator 's and saviour 's gospel to mankind ; a volume bound in rose-leaves , clasped with violets , and by the beaks of humming-birds printed with peach-juice on the leaves of lilies .
melville	pierre	endless is the account of love . time and space can not contain love 's story . all things that are sweet to see , or taste , or feel , or hear , all these things were made by love ; and none other things were made by love . love made not the arctic zones , but love is ever reclaiming them . say , are not the fierce things of this earth daily , hourly going out ? where now are your wolves of britain ? where in virginia now , find you the panther and the pard ? oh , love is busy everywhere . everywhere love hath moravian missionaries . no propagandist like to love . the south wind wooes the barbarous north ; on many a distant shore the gentler west wind persuades the arid east .
melville	pierre	all this earth is love 's affianced ; vainly the demon principle howls to stay the banns . why round her middle wears this world so rich a zone of torrid verdure , if she be not dressing for the final rites ? and why provides she orange blossoms and lilies of the valley , if she would not that all men and maids should love and marry ? for every wedding where true lovers wed , helps on the march of universal love . who are brides here shall be love 's bridemaids in the marriage world to come . so on all sides love allures ; can contain himself what youth who views the wonders of the beauteous woman-world ? where a beautiful woman is , there is all asia and her bazars . italy hath not a sight before the beauty of a yankee girl ; nor heaven a blessing beyond her earthly love . did not the angelical lotharios come down to earth , that they might taste of mortal woman 's love and beauty ? even while her own silly brothers were pining after the self-same paradise they left ? yes , those envying angels did come down ; did emigrate ; and who emigrates except to be better off ?
melville	pierre	love is this world 's great redeemer and reformer ; and as all beautiful women are her selectest emissaries , so hath love gifted them with a magnetical persuasiveness , that no youth can possibly repel . the own heart 's choice of every youth , seems ever as an inscrutable witch to him ; and by ten thousand concentric spells and circling incantations , glides round and round him , as he turns : murmuring meanings of unearthly import ; and summoning up to him all the subterranean sprites and gnomes ; and unpeopling all the sea for naiads to swim round him ; so that mysteries are evoked as in exhalations by this love ; -- what wonder then that love was aye a mystic ?
melville	pierre	v. and this self-same morning pierre was very mystical ; not continually , though ; but most mystical one moment , and overflowing with mad , unbridled merriment , the next . he seemed a youthful magian , and almost a mountebank together . chaldaic improvisations burst from him , in quick golden verses , on the heel of humorous retort and repartee . more especially , the bright glance of lucy was transporting to him . now , reckless of his horses , with both arms holding lucy in his embrace , like a sicilian diver he dives deep down in the adriatic of her eyes , and brings up some king's-cup of joy . all the waves in lucy 's eyes seemed waves of infinite glee to him . and as if , like veritable seas , they did indeed catch the reflected irradiations of that pellucid azure morning ; in lucy 's eyes , there seemed to shine all the blue glory of the general day , and all the sweet inscrutableness of the sky . and certainly , the blue eye of woman , like the sea , is not uninfluenced by the atmosphere . only in the open air of some divinest , summer day , will you see its ultramarine , -- its fluid lapis lazuli . then would pierre burst forth in some screaming shout of joy ; and the striped tigers of his chestnut eyes leaped in their lashed cages with a fierce delight . lucy shrank from him in extreme love ; for the extremest top of love , is fear and wonder .
melville	pierre	soon the swift horses drew this fair god and goddess nigh the wooded hills , whose distant blue , now changed into a variously-shaded green , stood before them like old babylonian walls , overgrown with verdure ; while here and there , at regular intervals , the scattered peaks seemed mural towers ; and the clumped pines surmounting them , as lofty archers , and vast , out-looking watchers of the glorious babylonian city of the day . catching that hilly air , the prancing horses neighed ; laughed on the ground with gleeful feet . felt they the gay delightsome spurrings of the day ; for the day was mad with excessive joy ; and high in heaven you heard the neighing of the horses of the sun ; and down dropt their nostrils ' froth in many a fleecy vapor from the hills .
melville	pierre	from the plains , the mists rose slowly ; reluctant yet to quit so fair a mead . at those green slopings , pierre reined in his steeds , and soon the twain were seated on the bank , gazing far , and far away ; over many a grove and lake ; corn-crested uplands , and herd's-grass lowlands ; and long-stretching swales of vividest green , betokening where the greenest bounty of this earth seeks its winding channels ; as ever , the most heavenly bounteousness most seeks the lowly places ; making green and glad many a humble mortal 's breast , and leaving to his own lonely aridness , many a hill-top prince 's state .
melville	pierre	but grief , not joy , is a moralizer ; and small moralizing wisdom caught pierre from that scene . with lucy 's hand in his , and feeling , softly feeling of its soft tinglingness ; he seemed as one placed in linked correspondence with the summer lightnings ; and by sweet shock on shock , receiving intimating fore-tastes of the etherealest delights of earth .
melville	pierre	now , prone on the grass he falls , with his attentive upward glance fixed on lucy 's eyes . `` thou art my heaven , lucy ; and here i lie thy shepherd-king , watching for new eye-stars to rise in thee . ha ! i see venus ' transit now ; -- lo ! a new planet there ; -- and behind all , an infinite starry nebulousness , as if thy being were backgrounded by some spangled vail of mystery . ''
melville	pierre	is lucy deaf to all these ravings of his lyric love ? why looks she down , and vibrates so ; and why now from her over-charged lids , drops such warm drops as these ? no joy now in lucy 's eyes , and seeming tremor on her lips .
melville	pierre	`` ah ! thou too ardent and impetuous pierre ! '' `` nay , thou too moist and changeful april ! know'st thou not , that the moist and changeful april is followed by the glad , assured , and showerless joy of june ? and this , lucy , this day should be thy june , even as it is the earth 's ? ''
melville	pierre	`` ah pierre ! not june to me . but say , are not the sweets of june made sweet by the april tears ? '' `` ay , love ! but here fall more drops , -- more and more ; -- these showers are longer than beseem the april , and pertain not to the june . ''
melville	pierre	`` june ! june ! -- thou bride 's month of the summer , -- following the spring 's sweet courtship of the earth , -- my june , my june is yet to come ! '' `` oh ! yet to come , but fixedly decreed ; -- good as come , and better . ''
melville	pierre	`` then no flower that , in the bud , the april showers have nurtured ; no such flower may untimely perish , ere the june unfolds it ? ye will not swear that , pierre ? '' `` the audacious immortalities of divinest love are in me ; and i now swear to thee all the immutable eternities of joyfulness , that ever woman dreamed of , in this dream-house of the earth . a god decrees to thee unchangeable felicity ; and to me , the unchallenged possession of thee and them , for my inalienable fief. -- do i rave ? look on me , lucy ; think on me , girl . ''
melville	pierre	`` thou art young , and beautiful , and strong ; and a joyful manliness invests thee , pierre ; and thy intrepid heart never yet felt the touch of fear ; -- but -- '' `` but what ? '' `` ah , my best pierre ! ''
melville	pierre	`` with kisses i will suck thy secret from thy cheek ! -- but what ? '' `` let us hie homeward , pierre . some nameless sadness , faintness , strangely comes to me . foretaste i feel of endless dreariness . tell me once more the story of that face , pierre , -- that mysterious , haunting face , which thou once told'st me , thou didst thrice vainly try to shun . blue is the sky , oh , bland the air , pierre ; -- but -- tell me the story of the face , -- the dark-eyed , lustrous , imploring , mournful face , that so mystically paled , and shrunk at thine . ah , pierre , sometimes i have thought , -- never will i wed with my best pierre , until the riddle of that face be known . tell me , tell me , pierre ; -- as a fixed basilisk , with eyes of steady , flaming mournfulness , that face this instant fastens me . ''
melville	pierre	`` bewitched ! bewitched ! -- cursed be the hour i acted on the thought , that love hath no reserves . never should i have told thee the story of that face , lucy . i have bared myself too much to thee . oh , never should love know all ! ''
melville	pierre	`` knows not all , then loves not all , pierre . never shalt thou so say again ; -- and pierre , listen to me . now , -- now , in this inexplicable trepidation that i feel , i do conjure thee , that thou wilt ever continue to do as thou hast done ; so that i may ever continue to know all that agitatest thee , the airiest and most transient thought , that ever shall sweep into thee from the wide atmosphere of all things that hem mortality . did i doubt thee here ; -- could i ever think , that thy heart hath yet one private nook or corner from me ; -- fatal disenchanting day for me , my pierre , would that be . i tell thee , pierre -- and 't is love 's own self that now speaks through me -- only in unbounded confidence and interchangings of all subtlest secrets , can love possibly endure . love 's self is a secret , and so feeds on secrets , pierre . did i only know of thee , what the whole common world may know -- what then were pierre to me ? -- thou must be wholly a disclosed secret to me ; love is vain and proud ; and when i walk the streets , and meet thy friends , i must still be laughing and hugging to myself the thought , -- they know him not ; -- i only know my pierre ; -- none else beneath the circuit of yon sun . then , swear to me , dear pierre , that thou wilt never keep a secret from me -- no , never , never ; -- swear ! ''
melville	pierre	`` something seizes me . thy inexplicable tears , falling , falling on my heart , have now turned it to a stone . i feel icy cold and hard ; i will not swear ! '' `` pierre ! pierre ! ''
melville	pierre	`` god help thee , and god help me , lucy . i can not think , that in this most mild and dulcet air , the invisible agencies are plotting treasons against our loves . oh ! if ye be now nigh us , ye things i have no name for ; then by a name that should be efficacious -- by christ 's holy name , i warn ye back from her and me . touch her not , ye airy devils ; hence to your appointed hell ! why come ye prowling in these heavenly perlieus ? can not the chains of love omnipotent bind ye , fiends ? ''
melville	pierre	`` is this pierre ? his eyes glare fearfully ; now i see layer on layer deeper in him ; he turns round and menaces the air and talks to it , as if defied by the air . woe is me , that fairy love should raise this evil spell ! -- pierre ? ''
melville	pierre	`` but now i was infinite distances from thee , oh my lucy , wandering baffled in the choking night ; but thy voice might find me , though i had wandered to the boreal realm , lucy . here i sit down by thee ; i catch a soothing from thee . ''
melville	pierre	`` my own , own pierre ! pierre , into ten trillion pieces i could now be torn for thee ; in my bosom would yet hide thee , and there keep thee warm , though i sat down on arctic ice-floes , frozen to a corpse . my own , best , blessed pierre ! now , could i plant some poniard in me , that my silly ailings should have power to move thee thus , and pain thee thus . forgive me , pierre ; thy changed face hath chased the other from me ; the fright of thee exceeds all other frights . it does not so haunt me now . press hard my hand ; look hard on me , my love , that its last trace may pass away . now i feel almost whole again ; now , 't is gone . up , my pierre ; let us up , and fly these hills , whence , i fear , too wide a prospect meets us . fly we to the plain . see , thy steeds neigh for thee -- they call thee -- see , the clouds fly down toward the plain -- lo , these hills now seem all desolate to me , and the vale all verdure . thank thee , pierre. -- see , now , i quit the hills , dry-cheeked ; and leave all tears behind to be sucked in by these evergreens , meet emblems of the unchanging love , my own sadness nourishes in me . hard fate , that love 's best verdure should feed so on tears ! ''
melville	pierre	now they rolled swiftly down the slopes ; nor tempted the upper hills ; but sped fast for the plain . now the cloud hath passed from lucy 's eye ; no more the lurid slanting light forks upward from her lover 's brow . in the plain they find peace , and love , and joy again .
melville	pierre	`` it was the merest , idling , wanton vapor , lucy ! '' `` an empty echo , pierre , of a sad sound , long past . bless thee , my pierre ! '' `` the great god wrap thee ever , lucy . so , now , we are home . ''
melville	pierre	vi . after seeing lucy into her aunt 's most cheerful parlor , and seating her by the honeysuckle that half clambered into the window there ; and near to which was her easel for crayon-sketching , upon part of whose frame lucy had cunningly trained two slender vines , into whose earth-filled pots two of the three legs of the easel were inserted ; and sitting down himself by her , and by his pleasant , lightsome chat , striving to chase the last trace of sadness from her ; and not till his object seemed fully gained ; pierre rose to call her good aunt to her , and so take his leave till evening , when lucy called him back , begging him first to bring her the blue portfolio from her chamber , for she wished to kill her last lingering melancholy -- if any indeed did linger now -- by diverting her thoughts , in a little pencil sketch , to scenes widely different from those of saddle meadows and its hills .
melville	pierre	so pierre went up stairs , but paused on the threshold of the open door . he never had entered that chamber but with feelings of a wonderful reverentialness . the carpet seemed as holy ground . every chair seemed sanctified by some departed saint , there once seated long ago . here his book of love was all a rubric , and said -- bow now , pierre , bow . but this extreme loyalty to the piety of love , called from him by such glimpses of its most secret inner shrine , was not unrelieved betimes by such quickenings of all his pulses , that in fantasy he pressed the wide beauty of the world in his embracing arms ; for all his world resolved itself into his heart 's best love for lucy .
melville	pierre	now , crossing the magic silence of the empty chamber , he caught the snow-white bed reflected in the toilet-glass . this rooted him . for one swift instant , he seemed to see in that one glance the two separate beds -- the real one and the reflected one -- and an unbidden , most miserable presentiment thereupon stole into him . but in one breath it came and went . so he advanced , and with a fond and gentle joyfulness , his eye now fell upon the spotless bed itself , and fastened on a snow-white roll that lay beside the pillow . now he started ; lucy seemed coming in upon him ; but no -- 't is only the foot of one of her little slippers , just peeping into view from under the narrow nether curtains of the bed . then again his glance fixed itself upon the slender , snow-white , ruffled roll ; and he stood as one enchanted . never precious parchment of the greek was half so precious in his eyes . never trembling scholar longed more to unroll the mystic vellum , than pierre longed to unroll the sacred secrets of that snow-white , ruffled thing . but his hands touched not any object in that chamber , except the one he had gone thither for .
melville	pierre	`` here is the blue portfolio , lucy . see , the key hangs to its silver lock ; -- were you not fearful i would open it ? -- 't was tempting , i must confess . '' `` open it ! '' said lucy -- '' why , yes , pierre , yes ; what secret thing keep i from thee ? read me through and through . i am entirely thine . see ! '' and tossing open the portfolio , all manner of rosy things came floating from it , and a most delicate perfume of some invisible essence .
melville	pierre	`` ah ! thou holy angel , lucy ! '' `` why , pierre , thou art transfigured ; thou now lookest as one who -- why , pierre ? '' `` as one who had just peeped in at paradise , lucy ; and -- -- '' `` again wandering in thy mind , pierre ; no more -- come , you must leave me , now . i am quite rested again . quick , call my aunt , and leave me . stay , this evening we are to look over the book of plates from the city , you know . be early ; -- go now , pierre . ''
melville	pierre	`` well , good-bye , till evening , thou height of all delight . '' vii . as pierre drove through the silent village , beneath the vertical shadows of the noon-day trees , the sweet chamber scene abandoned him , and the mystical face recurred to him , and kept with him . at last , arrived at home , he found his mother absent ; so passing straight through the wide middle hall of the mansion , he descended the piazza on the other ride , and wandered away in reveries down to the river bank .
melville	pierre	here one primeval pine-tree had been luckily left standing by the otherwise unsparing woodmen , who long ago had cleared that meadow . it was once crossing to this noble pine , from a clump of hemlocks far across the river , that pierre had first noticed the significant fact , that while the hemlock and the pine are trees of equal growth and stature , and are so similar in their general aspect , that people unused to woods sometimes confound them ; and while both trees are proverbially trees of sadness , yet the dark hemlock hath no music in its thoughtful boughs ; but the gentle pine-tree drops melodious mournfulness .
melville	pierre	at its half-bared roots of sadness , pierre sat down , and marked the mighty bulk and far out-reaching length of one particular root , which , straying down the bank , the storms and rains had years ago exposed .
melville	pierre	`` how wide , how strong these roots must spread ! sure , this pine-tree takes powerful hold of this fair earth ! yon bright flower hath not so deep a root . this tree hath outlived a century of that gay flower 's generations , and will outlive a century of them yet to come . this is most sad . hark , now i hear the pyramidical and numberless , flame-like complainings of this eolean pine ; -- the wind breathes now upon it : -- the wind , -- that is god 's breath ! is he so sad ? oh , tree ! so mighty thou , so lofty , yet so mournful ! this is most strange ! hark ! as i look up into thy high secrecies , oh , tree , the face , the face , peeps down on me ! -- 'art thou pierre ? come to me ' -- oh , thou mysterious girl , -- what an ill-matched pendant thou , to that other countenance of sweet lucy , which also hangs , and first did hang within my heart ! is grief a pendant then to pleasantness ? is grief a self-willed guest that _will_ come in ? yet i have never known thee , grief ; -- thou art a legend to me . i have known some fiery broils of glorious frenzy ; i have oft tasted of revery ; whence comes pensiveness ; whence comes sadness ; whence all delicious poetic presentiments ; -- but thou , grief ! art still a ghost-story to me . i know thee not , -- do half disbelieve in thee . not that i would be without my too little cherished fits of sadness now and then ; but god keep me from thee , thou other shape of far profounder gloom ! i shudder at thee ! the face ! -- the face ! -- forth again from thy high secrecies , oh , tree ! the face steals down upon me . mysterious girl ! who art thou ? by what right snatchest thou thus my deepest thoughts ? take thy thin fingers from me ; -- i am affianced , and not to thee . leave me ! -- what share hast thou in me ? surely , thou lovest not me ? -- that were most miserable for thee , and me , and lucy . it can not be . what , _who_ art thou ? oh ! wretched vagueness -- too familiar to me , yet inexplicable , -- unknown , utterly unknown ! i seem to founder in this perplexity . thou seemest to know somewhat of me , that i know not of myself , -- what is it then ? if thou hast a secret in thy eyes of mournful mystery , out with it ; pierre demands it ; what is that thou hast veiled in thee so imperfectly , that i seem to see its motion , but not its form ? it visibly rustles behind the concealing screen . now , never into the soul of pierre , stole there before , a muffledness like this ! if aught really lurks in it , ye sovereign powers that claim all my leal worshipings , i conjure ye to lift the veil ; i must see it face to face . tread i on a mine , warn me ; advance i on a precipice , hold me back ; but abandon me to an unknown misery , that it shall suddenly seize me , and possess me , wholly , -- that ye will never do ; else , pierre 's fond faith in ye -- now clean , untouched -- may clean depart ; and give me up to be a railing atheist ! ah , now the face departs . pray heaven it hath not only stolen back , and hidden again in thy high secrecies , oh tree ! but 't is gone -- gone -- entirely gone ; and i thank god , and i feel joy again ; joy , which i also feel to be my right as man ; deprived of joy , i feel i should find cause for deadly feuds with things invisible . ha ! a coat of iron-mail seems to grow round , and husk me now ; and i have heard , that the bitterest winters are foretold by a thicker husk upon the indian corn ; so our old farmers say . but 't is a dark similitude . quit thy analogies ; sweet in the orator 's mouth , bitter in the thinker 's belly . now , then , i 'll up with my own joyful will ; and with my joy 's face scare away all phantoms : -- so , they go ; and pierre is joy 's , and life 's again . thou pine-tree ! -- henceforth i will resist thy too treacherous persuasiveness . thou'lt not so often woo me to thy airy tent , to ponder on the gloomy rooted stakes that bind it . hence now i go ; and peace be with thee , pine ! that blessed sereneness which lurks ever at the heart of sadness -- mere sadness -- and remains when all the rest has gone ; -- that sweet feeling is now mine , and cheaply mine . i am not sorry i was sad , i feel so blessed now . dearest lucy ! -- well , well ; -- 'twill be a pretty time we 'll have this evening ; there 's the book of flemish prints -- that first we must look over ; then , second , is flaxman 's homer -- clear-cut outlines , yet full of unadorned barbaric nobleness . then flaxman 's dante ; -- dante ! night 's and hell 's poet he . no , we will not open dante . methinks now the face -- the face -- minds me a little of pensive , sweet francesca 's face -- or , rather , as it had been francesca 's daughter 's face -- wafted on the sad dark wind , toward observant virgil and the blistered florentine . no , we will not open flaxman 's dante . francesca 's mournful face is now ideal to me . flaxman might evoke it wholly , -- make it present in lines of misery -- bewitching power . no ! i will not open flaxman 's dante ! damned be the hour i read in dante ! more damned than that wherein paolo and francesca read in fatal launcelot ! ''
melville	pierre	book iii . the presentiment and the verification . i . the face , of which pierre and lucy so strangely and fearfully hinted , was not of enchanted air ; but its mortal lineaments of mournfulness had been visibly beheld by pierre . nor had it accosted him in any privacy ; or in any lonely byeway ; or beneath the white light of the crescent moon ; but in a joyous chamber , bright with candles , and ringing with two score women 's gayest voices . out of the heart of mirthfulness , this shadow had come forth to him . encircled by bandelets of light , it had still beamed upon him ; vaguely historic and prophetic ; backward , hinting of some irrevocable sin ; forward , pointing to some inevitable ill. one of those faces , which now and then appear to man , and without one word of speech , still reveal glimpses of some fearful gospel . in natural guise , but lit by supernatural light ; palpable to the senses , but inscrutable to the soul ; in their perfectest impression on us , ever hovering between tartarean misery and paradisaic beauty ; such faces , compounded so of hell and heaven , overthrow in us all foregone persuasions , and make us wondering children in this world again .
melville	pierre	the face had accosted pierre some weeks previous to his ride with lucy to the hills beyond saddle meadows ; and before her arrival for the summer at the village ; moreover it had accosted him in a very common and homely scene ; but this enhanced the wonder .
melville	pierre	on some distant business , with a farmer-tenant , he had been absent from the mansion during the best part of the day , and had but just come home , early of a pleasant moonlight evening , when dates delivered a message to him from his mother , begging him to come for her about half-past seven that night to miss llanyllyn 's cottage , in order to accompany her thence to that of the two miss pennies . at the mention of that last name , pierre well knew what he must anticipate . those elderly and truly pious spinsters , gifted with the most benevolent hearts in the world , and at mid-age deprived by envious nature of their hearing , seemed to have made it a maxim of their charitable lives , that since god had not given them any more the power to hear christ 's gospel preached , they would therefore thenceforth do what they could toward practicing it . wherefore , as a matter of no possible interest to them now , they abstained from church ; and while with prayer-books in their hands the rev . mr. falsgrave 's congregation were engaged in worshiping their god , according to the divine behest ; the two miss pennies , with thread and needle , were hard at work in serving him ; making up shirts and gowns for the poor people of the parish . pierre had heard that they had recently been at the trouble of organizing a regular society , among the neighboring farmers ' wives and daughters , to meet twice a month at their own house ( the miss pennies ) for the purpose of sewing in concert for the benefit of various settlements of necessitous emigrants , who had lately pitched their populous shanties further up the river . but though this enterprise had not been started without previously acquainting mrs. glendinning of it , -- for indeed she was much loved and honored by the pious spinsters , -- and their promise of solid assistance from that gracious manorial lady ; yet pierre had not heard that his mother had been officially invited to preside , or be at all present at the semi-monthly meetings ; though he supposed , that far from having any scruples against so doing , she would be very glad to associate that way , with the good people of the village .
melville	pierre	`` now , brother pierre '' -- said mrs. glendinning , rising from miss llanyllyn 's huge cushioned chair -- '' throw my shawl around me ; and good-evening to lucy 's aunt. -- there , we shall be late . '' as they walked along , she added -- '' now , pierre , i know you are apt to be a little impatient sometimes , of these sewing scenes ; but courage ; i merely want to peep in on them ; so as to get some inkling of what they would indeed be at ; and then my promised benefactions can be better selected by me . besides , pierre , i could have had dates escort me , but i preferred you ; because i want you to know who they are you live among ; how many really pretty , and naturally-refined dames and girls you shall one day be lord of the manor of . i anticipate a rare display of rural red and white . ''
melville	pierre	cheered by such pleasant promises , pierre soon found himself leading his mother into a room full of faces . the instant they appeared , a gratuitous old body , seated with her knitting near the door , squeaked out shrilly -- '' ah ! dames , dames , -- madam glendinning ! -- master pierre glendinning ! ''
melville	pierre	almost immediately following this sound , there came a sudden , long-drawn , unearthly , girlish shriek , from the further corner of the long , double room . never had human voice so affected pierre before . though he saw not the person from whom it came , and though the voice was wholly strange to him , yet the sudden shriek seemed to split its way clean through his heart , and leave a yawning gap there . for an instant , he stood bewildered ; but started at his mother 's voice ; her arm being still in his . `` why do you clutch my arm so , pierre ? you pain me . pshaw ! some one has fainted , -- nothing more . ''
melville	pierre	instantly pierre recovered himself , and affecting to mock at his own trepidation , hurried across the room to offer his services , if such were needed . but dames and maidens had been all beforehand with him ; the lights were wildly flickering in the air-current made by the flinging open of the casement , near to where the shriek had come . but the climax of the tumult was soon past ; and presently , upon closing the casement , it subsided almost wholly . the elder of the spinster pennies , advancing to mrs. glendinning , now gave her to understand , that one of the further crowd of industrious girls present , had been attacked by a sudden , but fleeting fit , vaguely imputable to some constitutional disorder or other . she was now quite well again . and so the company , one and all , seemingly acting upon their natural good-breeding , which in any one at bottom , is but delicacy and charity , refrained from all further curiosity ; reminded not the girl of what had passed ; noted her scarce at all ; and all needles stitched away as before .
melville	pierre	leaving his mother to speak with whom she pleased , and attend alone to her own affairs with the society ; pierre , oblivious now in such a lively crowd , of any past unpleasantness , after some courtly words to the miss pennies , -- insinuated into their understandings through a long coiled trumpet , which , when not in use , the spinsters wore , hanging like a powder-horn from their girdles : -- and likewise , after manifesting the profoundest and most intelligent interest in the mystic mechanism of a huge woolen sock , in course of completion by a spectacled old lady of his more particular acquaintance ; after all this had been gone through , and something more too tedious to detail , but which occupied him for nearly half an hour , pierre , with a slightly blushing , and imperfectly balanced assurance , advanced toward the further crowd of maidens ; where , by the light of many a well-snuffed candle , they clubbed all their bright contrasting cheeks , like a dense bed of garden tulips . there were the shy and pretty maries , marthas , susans , betties , jennies , nellies ; and forty more fair nymphs , who skimmed the cream , and made the butter of the fat farms of saddle meadows .
melville	pierre	assurance is in presence of the assured . where embarrassments prevail , they affect the most disembarrassed . what wonder , then , that gazing on such a thick array of wreathing , roguish , half-averted , blushing faces -- still audacious in their very embarrassment -- pierre , too , should flush a bit , and stammer in his attitudes a little ? youthful love and graciousness were in his heart ; kindest words upon his tongue ; but there he stood , target for the transfixing glances of those ambushed archers of the eye .
melville	pierre	but his abashments last too long ; his cheek hath changed from blush to pallor ; what strange thing does pierre glendinning see ? behind the first close , busy breast-work of young girls , are several very little stands , or circular tables , where sit small groups of twos and threes , sewing in small comparative solitudes , as it were . they would seem to be the less notable of the rural company ; or else , for some cause , they have voluntarily retired into their humble banishment . upon one of these persons engaged at the furthermost and least conspicuous of these little stands , and close by a casement , pierre 's glance is palely fixed .
melville	pierre	the girl sits steadily sewing ; neither she nor her two companions speak . her eyes are mostly upon her work ; but now and then a very close observer would notice that she furtively lifts them , and moves them sideways and timidly toward pierre ; and then , still more furtively and timidly toward his lady mother , further off . all the while , her preternatural calmness sometimes seems only made to cover the intensest struggle in her bosom . her unadorned and modest dress is black ; fitting close up to her neck , and clasping it with a plain , velvet border . to a nice perception , that velvet shows elastically ; contracting and expanding , as though some choked , violent thing were risen up there within from the teeming region of her heart . but her dark , olive cheek is without a blush , or sign of any disquietude . so far as this girl lies upon the common surface , ineffable composure steeps her . but still , she sideways steals the furtive , timid glance . anon , as yielding to the irresistible climax of her concealed emotion , whatever that may be , she lifts her whole marvelous countenance into the radiant candlelight , and for one swift instant , that face of supernaturalness unreservedly meets pierre 's . now , wonderful loveliness , and a still more wonderful loneliness , have with inexplicable implorings , looked up to him from that henceforth immemorial face . there , too , he seemed to see the fair ground where anguish had contended with beauty , and neither being conqueror , both had laid down on the field .
melville	pierre	recovering at length from his all too obvious emotion , pierre turned away still farther , to regain the conscious possession of himself . a wild , bewildering , and incomprehensible curiosity had seized him , to know something definite of that face . to this curiosity , at the moment , he entirely surrendered himself ; unable as he was to combat it , or reason with it in the slightest way . so soon as he felt his outward composure returned to him , he purposed to chat his way behind the breastwork of bright eyes and cheeks , and on some parlor pretense or other , hear , if possible , an audible syllable from one whose mere silent aspect had so potentially moved him . but at length , as with this object in mind , he was crossing the room again , he heard his mother 's voice , gayly calling him away ; and turning , saw her shawled and bonneted . he could now make no plausible stay , and smothering the agitation in him , he bowed a general and hurried adieu to the company , and went forth with his mother .
melville	pierre	they had gone some way homeward , in perfect silence , when his mother spoke . `` well , pierre , what can it possibly be ! '' `` my god , mother , did you see her then ! '' `` my son ! '' cried mrs. glendinning , instantly stopping in terror , and withdrawing her arm from pierre , `` what -- what under heaven ails you ? this is most strange ! i but playfully asked , what you were so steadfastly thinking of ; and here you answer me by the strangest question , in a voice that seems to come from under your great-grandfather 's tomb ! what , in heaven 's name , does this mean , pierre ? why were you so silent , and why now are you so ill-timed in speaking ! answer me ; -- explain all this ; -- _she_ -- _she_ -- what _she_ should you be thinking of but lucy tartan ? -- pierre , beware , beware ! i had thought you firmer in your lady 's faith , than such strange behavior as this would seem to hint . answer me , pierre , what may this mean ? come , i hate a mystery ; speak , my son . ''
melville	pierre	fortunately , this prolonged verbalized wonder in his mother afforded pierre time to rally from his double and aggravated astonishment , brought about by first suspecting that his mother also had been struck by the strange aspect of the face , and then , having that suspicion so violently beaten back upon him , by her apparently unaffected alarm at finding him in some region of thought wholly unshared by herself at the time .
melville	pierre	`` it is nothing -- nothing , sister mary ; just nothing at all in the world . i believe i was dreaming -- sleep-walking , or something of that sort . they were vastly pretty girls there this evening , sister mary , were they not ? come , let us walk on -- do , sister mine . ''
melville	pierre	`` pierre , pierre ! -- but i will take your arm again ; -- and have you really nothing more to say ? were you really wandering , pierre ? '' `` i swear to you , my dearest mother , that never before in my whole existence , have i so completely gone wandering in my soul , as at that very moment . but it is all over now . '' then in a less earnest and somewhat playful tone , he added : `` and sister mine , if you know aught of the physical and sanitary authors , you must be aware , that the only treatment for such a case of harmless temporary aberration , is for all persons to ignore it in the subject . so no more of this foolishness . talking about it only makes me feel very unpleasantly silly , and there is no knowing that it may not bring it back upon me . ''
melville	pierre	`` then by all means , my dear boy , not another word about it . but it 's passing strange -- very , very strange indeed . well , about that morning business ; how fared you ? tell me about it . ''
melville	pierre	ii . so pierre , gladly plunging into this welcome current of talk , was enabled to attend his mother home without furnishing further cause for her concern or wonderment . but not by any means so readily could he allay his own concern and wonderment . too really true in itself , however evasive in its effect at the time , was that earnest answer to his mother , declaring that never in his whole existence had he been so profoundly stirred . the face haunted him as some imploring , and beauteous , impassioned , ideal madonna 's haunts the morbidly longing and enthusiastic , but ever-baffled artist . and ever , as the mystic face thus rose before his fancy 's sight , another sense was touched in him ; the long-drawn , unearthly , girlish shriek pealed through and through his soul ; for now he knew the shriek came from the face -- such delphic shriek could only come from such a source . and wherefore that shriek ? thought pierre . bodes it ill to the face , or me , or both ? how am i changed , that my appearance on any scene should have power to work such woe ? but it was mostly the face -- the face , that wrought upon him . the shriek seemed as incidentally embodied there .
melville	pierre	the emotions he experienced seemed to have taken hold of the deepest roots and subtlest fibres of his being . and so much the more that it was so subterranean in him , so much the more did he feel its weird inscrutableness . what was one unknown , sad-eyed , shrieking girl to him ? there must be sad-eyed girls somewhere in the world , and this was only one of them . and what was the most beautiful sad-eyed girl to him ? sadness might be beautiful , as well as mirth -- he lost himself trying to follow out this tangle . `` i will no more of this infatuation , '' he would cry ; but forth from regions of irradiated air , the divine beauty and imploring sufferings of the face , stole into his view .
melville	pierre	hitherto i have ever held but lightly , thought pierre , all stories of ghostly mysticalness in man ; my creed of this world leads me to believe in visible , beautiful flesh , and audible breath , however sweet and scented ; but only in visible flesh , and audible breath , have i hitherto believed . but now ! -- now ! -- and again he would lose himself in the most surprising and preternatural ponderings , which baffled all the introspective cunning of his mind . himself was too much for himself . he felt that what he had always before considered the solid land of veritable reality , was now being audaciously encroached upon by bannered armies of hooded phantoms , disembarking in his soul , as from flotillas of specter-boats .
melville	pierre	the terrors of the face were not those of gorgon ; not by repelling hideousness did it smite him so ; but bewilderingly allured him , by its nameless beauty , and its long-suffering , hopeless anguish .
melville	pierre	but he was sensible that this general effect upon him , was also special ; the face somehow mystically appealing to his own private and individual affections ; and by a silent and tyrannic call , challenging him in his deepest moral being , and summoning truth , love , pity , conscience , to the stand . apex of all wonders ! thought pierre ; this indeed almost unmans me with its wonderfulness . escape the face he could not . muffling his own in his bed-clothes -- that did not hide it . flying from it by sunlight down the meadows , was as vain .
melville	pierre	most miraculous of all to pierre was the vague impression , that somewhere he had seen traits of the likeness of that face before . but where , he could not say ; nor could he , in the remotest degree , imagine . he was not unaware -- for in one or two instances , he had experienced the fact -- that sometimes a man may see a passing countenance in the street , which shall irresistibly and magnetically affect him , for a moment , as wholly unknown to him , and yet strangely reminiscent of some vague face he has previously encountered , in some fancied time , too , of extreme interest to his life . but not so was it now with pierre . the face had not perplexed him for a few speculative minutes , and then glided from him , to return no more . it stayed close by him ; only -- and not invariably -- could he repel it , by the exertion of all his resolution and self-will . besides , what of general enchantment lurked in his strange sensations , seemed concentringly condensed , and pointed to a spear-head , that pierced his heart with an inexplicable pang , whenever the specializing emotion -- to call it so -- seized the possession of his thoughts , and waved into his visions , a thousand forms of by-gone times , and many an old legendary family scene , which he had heard related by his elderly relations , some of them now dead .
melville	pierre	disguising his wild reveries as best he might from the notice of his mother , and all other persons of her household , for two days pierre wrestled with his own haunted spirit ; and at last , so effectually purged it of all weirdnesses , and so effectually regained the general mastery of himself , that for a time , life went with him , as though he had never been stirred so strangely . once more , the sweet unconditional thought of lucy slid wholly into his soul , dislodging thence all such phantom occupants . once more he rode , he walked , he swam , he vaulted ; and with new zest threw himself into the glowing practice of all those manly exercises , he so dearly loved . it almost seemed in him , that ere promising forever to protect , as well as eternally to love , his lucy , he must first completely invigorate and embrawn himself into the possession of such a noble muscular manliness , that he might champion lucy against the whole physical world .
melville	pierre	still -- even before the occasional reappearance of the face to him -- pierre , for all his willful ardor in his gymnasticals and other diversions , whether in-doors or out , or whether by book or foil ; still , pierre could not but be secretly annoyed , and not a little perplexed , as to the motive , which , for the first time in his recollection , had impelled him , not merely to conceal from his mother a singular circumstance in his life ( for that , he felt would have been but venial ; and besides , as will eventually be seen , he could find one particular precedent for it , in his past experience ) but likewise , and superaddedly , to parry , nay , to evade , and , in effect , to return something alarmingly like a fib , to an explicit question put to him by his mother ; -- such being the guise , in which part of the conversation they had had that eventful night , now appeared to his fastidious sense . he considered also , that his evasive answer had not pantheistically burst from him in a momentary interregnum of self-command . no ; his mother had made quite a lengthy speech to him ; during which he well remembered , he had been carefully , though with trepidation , turning over in his mind , how best he might recall her from her unwished-for and untimely scent . why had this been so ? was this his wont ? what inscrutable thing was it , that so suddenly had seized him , and made him a falsifyer -- ay , a falsifyer and nothing less -- to his own dearly-beloved , and confiding mother ? here , indeed , was something strange for him ; here was stuff for his utmost ethical meditations . but , nevertheless , on strict introspection , he felt , that he would not willingly have it otherwise ; not willingly would he now undissemble himself in this matter to his mother . why was this , too ? was this his wont ? here , again , was food for mysticism . here , in imperfect inklings , tinglings , presentiments , pierre began to feel -- what all mature men , who are magians , sooner or later know , and more or less assuredly -- that not always in our actions , are we our own factors . but this conceit was very dim in pierre ; and dimness is ever suspicious and repugnant to us ; and so , pierre shrank abhorringly from the infernal catacombs of thought , down into which , this foetal fancy beckoned him . only this , though in secret , did he cherish ; only this , he felt persuaded of ; namely , that not for both worlds would he have his mother made a partner to his sometime mystic mood .
melville	pierre	but with this nameless fascination of the face upon him , during those two days that it had first and fully possessed him for its own , did perplexed pierre refrain from that apparently most natural of all resources , -- boldly seeking out , and returning to the palpable cause , and questioning her , by look or voice , or both together -- the mysterious girl herself ? no ; not entirely did pierre here refrain . but his profound curiosity and interest in the matter -- strange as it may seem -- did not so much appear to be embodied in the mournful person of the olive girl , as by some radiations from her , embodied in the vague conceits which agitated his own soul . _there_ , lurked the subtler secret : _that_ , pierre had striven to tear away . from without , no wonderful effect is wrought within ourselves , unless some interior , responding wonder meets it . that the starry vault shall surcharge the heart with all rapturous marvelings , is only because we ourselves are greater miracles , and superber trophies than all the stars in universal space . wonder interlocks with wonder ; and then the confounding feeling comes . no cause have we to fancy , that a horse , a dog , a fowl , ever stand transfixed beneath yon skyey load of majesty . but our soul 's arches underfit into its ; and so , prevent the upper arch from falling on us with unsustainable inscrutableness . `` explain ye my deeper mystery , '' said the shepherd chaldean king , smiting his breast , lying on his back upon the plain ; `` and then , i will bestow all my wonderings upon ye , ye stately stars ! '' so , in some sort , with pierre . explain thou this strange integral feeling in me myself , he thought -- turning upon the fancied face -- and i will then renounce all other wonders , to gaze wonderingly at thee . but thou hast evoked in me profounder spells than the evoking one , thou face ! for me , thou hast uncovered one infinite , dumb , beseeching countenance of mystery , underlying all the surfaces of visible time and space .
melville	pierre	but during those two days of his first wild vassalage to his original sensations , pierre had not been unvisited by less mysterious impulses . two or three very plain and practical plannings of desirable procedures in reference to some possible homely explication of all this nonsense -- so he would momentarily denominate it -- now and then flittingly intermitted his pervading mood of semi-madness . once he had seized his hat , careless of his accustomed gloves and cane , and found himself in the street , walking very rapidly in the direction of the miss pennies ' . but whither now ? he disenchantingly interrogated himself . where would you go ? a million to one , those deaf old spinsters can tell you nothing you burn to know . deaf old spinsters are not used to be the depositaries of such mystical secrecies . but then , they may reveal her name -- where she dwells , and something , however fragmentary and unsatisfactory , of who she is , and whence . ay ; but then , in ten minutes after your leaving them , all the houses in saddle meadows would be humming with the gossip of pierre glendinning engaged to marry lucy tartan , and yet running about the country , in ambiguous pursuit of strange young women . that will never do . you remember , do you not , often seeing the miss pennies , hatless and without a shawl , hurrying through the village , like two postmen intent on dropping some tit-bit of precious gossip ? what a morsel for them , pierre , have you , if you now call upon them . verily , their trumpets are both for use and for significance . though very deaf , the miss pennies are by no means dumb . they blazon very wide .
melville	pierre	`` now be sure , and say that it was the miss pennies , who left the news -- be sure -- we -- the miss pennies -- remember -- say to mrs. glendinning it was we . '' such was the message that now half-humorously occurred to pierre , as having been once confided to him by the sister spinsters , one evening when they called with a choice present of some very _recherche_ chit-chat for his mother ; but found the manorial lady out ; and so charged her son with it ; hurrying away to all the inferior houses , so as not to be anywhere forestalled in their disclosure .
melville	pierre	now , i wish it had been any other house than the miss pennies ; any other house but theirs , and on my soul i believe i should have gone . but not to them -- no , that i can not do . it would be sure to reach my mother , and then she would put this and that together -- stir a little -- let it simmer -- and farewell forever to all her majestic notions of my immaculate integrity . patience , pierre , the population of this region is not so immense . no dense mobs of nineveh confound all personal identities in saddle meadows . patience ; thou shalt see it soon again ; catch it passing thee in some green lane , sacred to thy evening reveries . she that bears it can not dwell remote . patience , pierre . ever are such mysteries best and soonest unraveled by the eventual unraveling of themselves . or , if you will , go back and get your gloves , and more especially your cane , and begin your own secret voyage of discovery after it . your cane , i say ; because it will probably be a very long and weary walk . true , just now i hinted , that she that bears it can not dwell very remote ; but then her nearness may not be at all conspicuous . so , homeward , and put off thy hat , and let thy cane stay still , good pierre . seek not to mystify the mystery so .
melville	pierre	thus , intermittingly , ever and anon during those sad two days of deepest sufferance , pierre would stand reasoning and expostulating with himself ; and by such meditative treatment , reassure his own spontaneous impulses . doubtless , it was wise and right that so he did ; doubtless : but in a world so full of all dubieties as this , one can never be entirely certain whether another person , however carefully and cautiously conscientious , has acted in all respects conceivable for the very best .
melville	pierre	but when the two days were gone by , and pierre began to recognize his former self as restored to him from its mystic exile , then the thoughts of personally and pointedly seeking out the unknown , either preliminarily by a call upon the sister spinsters , or generally by performing the observant lynx-eyed circuit of the country on foot , and as a crafty inquisitor , dissembling his cause of inquisition ; these and all similar intentions completely abandoned pierre .
melville	pierre	he was now diligently striving , with all his mental might , forever to drive the phantom from him . he seemed to feel that it begat in him a certain condition of his being , which was most painful , and every way uncongenial to his natural , wonted self . it had a touch of he knew not what sort of unhealthiness in it , so to speak ; for , in his then ignorance , he could find no better term ; it seemed to have in it a germ of somewhat which , if not quickly extirpated , might insidiously poison and embitter his whole life -- that choice , delicious life which he had vowed to lucy for his one pure and comprehensive offering -- at once a sacrifice and a delight .
melville	pierre	nor in these endeavorings did he entirely fail . for the most part , he felt now that he had a power over the comings and the goings of the face ; but not on all occasions . sometimes the old , original mystic tyranny would steal upon him ; the long , dark , locks of mournful hair would fall upon his soul , and trail their wonderful melancholy along with them ; the two full , steady , over-brimming eyes of loveliness and anguish would converge their magic rays , till he felt them kindling he could not tell what mysterious fires in the heart at which they aimed .
melville	pierre	when once this feeling had him fully , then was the perilous time for pierre . for supernatural as the feeling was , and appealing to all things ultramontane to his soul ; yet was it a delicious sadness to him . some hazy fairy swam above him in the heavenly ether , and showered down upon him the sweetest pearls of pensiveness . then he would be seized with a singular impulse to reveal the secret to some one other individual in the world . only one , not more ; he could not hold all this strange fullness in himself . it must be shared . in such an hour it was , that chancing to encounter lucy ( her , whom above all others , he did confidingly adore ) , she heard the story of the face ; nor slept at all that night ; nor for a long time freed her pillow completely from wild , beethoven sounds of distant , waltzing melodies , as of ambiguous fairies dancing on the heath .
melville	pierre	iii . this history goes forward and goes backward , as occasion calls . nimble center , circumference elastic you must have . now we return to pierre , wending homeward from his reveries beneath the pine-tree .
melville	pierre	his burst of impatience against the sublime italian , dante , arising from that poet being the one who , in a former time , had first opened to his shuddering eyes the infinite cliffs and gulfs of human mystery and misery ; -- though still more in the way of experimental vision , than of sensational presentiment or experience ( for as yet he had not seen so far and deep as dante , and therefore was entirely incompetent to meet the grim bard fairly on his peculiar ground ) , this ignorant burst of his young impatience , -- also arising from that half contemptuous dislike , and sometimes selfish loathing , with which , either naturally feeble or undeveloped minds , regard those dark ravings of the loftier poets , which are in eternal opposition to their own fine-spun , shallow dreams of rapturous or prudential youth ; -- this rash , untutored burst of pierre 's young impatience , seemed to have carried off with it , all the other forms of his melancholy -- if melancholy it had been -- and left him now serene again , and ready for any tranquil pleasantness the gods might have in store . for his , indeed , was true youth 's temperament , -- summary with sadness , swift to joyfulness , and long protracting , and detaining with that joyfulness , when once it came fully nigh to him .
melville	pierre	as he entered the dining-hall , he saw dates retiring from another door with his tray . alone and meditative , by the bared half of the polished table , sat his mother at her dessert ; fruit-baskets , and a decanter were before her . on the other leaf of the same table , still lay the cloth , folded back upon itself , and set out with one plate and its usual accompaniments .
melville	pierre	`` sit down , pierre ; when i came home , i was surprised to hear that the phaeton had returned so early , and here i waited dinner for you , until i could wait no more . but go to the green pantry now , and get what dates has but just put away for you there . heigh-ho ! too plainly i foresee it -- no more regular dinner-hours , or tea-hours , or supper-hours , in saddle meadows , till its young lord is wedded . and that puts me in mind of something , pierre ; but i 'll defer it till you have eaten a little . do you know , pierre , that if you continue these irregular meals of yours , and deprive me so entirely almost of your company , that i shall run fearful risk of getting to be a terrible wine-bibber ; -- yes , could you unalarmed see me sitting all alone here with this decanter , like any old nurse , pierre ; some solitary , forlorn old nurse , pierre , deserted by her last friend , and therefore forced to embrace her flask ? ''
melville	pierre	`` no , i did not feel any great alarm , sister , '' said pierre , smiling , `` since i could not but perceive that the decanter was still full to the stopple . '' `` possibly it may be only a fresh decanter , pierre ; '' then changing her voice suddenly -- '' but mark me , mr. pierre glendinning ! ''
melville	pierre	`` well , mrs. mary glendinning ! '' `` do you know , sir , that you are very shortly to be married , -- that indeed the day is all but fixed ? '' `` how- ! '' cried pierre , in real joyful astonishment , both at the nature of the tidings , and the earnest tones in which they were conveyed -- '' dear , dear mother , you have strangely changed your mind then , my dear mother . ''
melville	pierre	`` it is even so , dear brother ; -- before this day month i hope to have a little sister tartan . '' `` you talk very strangely , mother , '' rejoined pierre , quickly . `` i suppose , then , i have next to nothing to say in the matter ! ''
melville	pierre	`` next to nothing , pierre ! what indeed could you say to the purpose ? what at all have you to do with it , i should like to know ? do you so much as dream , you silly boy , that men ever have the marrying of themselves ? juxtaposition marries men . there is but one match-maker in the world , pierre , and that is mrs. juxtaposition , a most notorious lady ! ''
melville	pierre	`` very peculiar , disenchanting sort of talk , this , under the circumstances , sister mary , '' laying down his fork . `` mrs. juxtaposition , ah ! and in your opinion , mother , does this fine glorious passion only amount to that ? ''
melville	pierre	`` only to that , pierre ; but mark you : according to my creed -- though this part of it is a little hazy -- mrs. juxtaposition moves her pawns only as she herself is moved to so doing by the spirit . ''
melville	pierre	`` ah ! that sets it all right again , '' said pierre , resuming his fork -- '' my appetite returns . but what was that about my being married so soon ? '' he added , vainly striving to assume an air of incredulity and unconcern ; `` you were joking , i suppose ; it seems to me , sister , either you or i was but just now wandering in the mind a little , on that subject . are you really thinking of any such thing ? and have you really vanquished your sagacious scruples by yourself , after i had so long and ineffectually sought to do it for you ? well , i am a million times delighted ; tell me quick ! ''
melville	pierre	`` i will , pierre . you very well know , that from the first hour you apprised me -- or rather , from a period prior to that -- from the moment that i , by my own insight , became aware of your love for lucy , i have always approved it . lucy is a delicious girl ; of honorable descent , a fortune , well-bred , and the very pattern of all that i think amiable and attractive in a girl of seventeen . ''
melville	pierre	`` well , well , well , '' cried pierre rapidly and impetuously ; `` we both knew that before . '' `` well , well , well , pierre , '' retorted his mother , mockingly . `` it is not well , well , well ; but ill , ill , ill , to torture me so , mother ; go on , do ! ''
melville	pierre	`` but notwithstanding my admiring approval of your choice , pierre ; yet , as you know , i have resisted your entreaties for my consent to your speedy marriage , because i thought that a girl of scarcely seventeen , and a boy scarcely twenty , should not be in such a hurry ; -- there was plenty of time , i thought , which could be profitably employed by both . ''
melville	pierre	`` permit me here to interrupt you , mother . whatever you may have seen in me ; she , -- i mean lucy , -- has never been in the slightest hurry to be married ; -- that 's all . but i shall regard it as a _lapsus-lingua_ in you . ''
melville	pierre	`` undoubtedly , a _lapsus_ . but listen to me . i have been carefully observing both you and lucy of late ; and that has made me think further of the matter . now , pierre , if you were in any profession , or in any business at all ; nay , if i were a farmer 's wife , and you my child , working in my fields ; why , then , you and lucy should still wait awhile . but as you have nothing to do but to think of lucy by day , and dream of her by night , and as she is in the same predicament , i suppose ; with respect to you ; and as the consequence of all this begins to be discernible in a certain , just perceptible , and quite harmless thinness , so to speak , of the cheek ; but a very conspicuous and dangerous febrileness of the eye ; therefore , i choose the lesser of two evils ; and now you have my permission to be married , as soon as the thing can be done with propriety . i dare say you have no objection to have the wedding take place before christmas , the present month being the first of summer . ''
melville	pierre	pierre said nothing ; but leaping to his feet , threw his two arms around his mother , and kissed her repeatedly . `` a most sweet and eloquent answer , pierre ; but sit down again . i desire now to say a little concerning less attractive , but quite necessary things connected with this affair . you know , that by your father 's will , these lands and -- ''
melville	pierre	`` miss lucy , my mistress ; '' said dates , throwing open the door . pierre sprang to his feet ; but as if suddenly mindful of his mother 's presence , composed himself again , though he still approached the door .
melville	pierre	lucy entered , carrying a little basket of strawberries . `` why , how do you do , my dear , '' said mrs. glendinning affectionately . `` this is an unexpected pleasure . '' `` yes ; and i suppose that pierre here is a little surprised too ; seeing that he was to call upon me this evening , and not i upon him before sundown . but i took a sudden fancy for a solitary stroll , -- the afternoon was such a delicious one ; and chancing -- it was only chancing -- to pass through the locust lane leading hither , i met the strangest little fellow , with this basket in his hand. -- 'yes , buy them , miss ' -- said he . 'and how do you know i want to buy them , ' returned i , ' i do n't want to buy them . ' -- 'yes you do , miss ; they ought to be twenty-six cents , but i 'll take thirteen cents , that being my shilling . i always want the odd half cent , i do . come , i ca n't wait , i have been expecting you long enough . ' ''
melville	pierre	`` a very sagacious little imp , '' laughed mrs. glendinning . `` impertinent little rascal , '' cried pierre . `` and am i not now the silliest of all silly girls , to be telling you my adventures so very frankly , '' smiled lucy .
melville	pierre	`` no ; but the most celestial of all innocents , '' cried pierre , in a rhapsody of delight . `` frankly open is the flower , that hath nothing but purity to show . '' `` now , my dear little lucy , '' said mrs. glendinning , `` let pierre take off your shawl , and come now and stay to tea with us . pierre has put back the dinner so , the tea-hour will come now very soon . ''
melville	pierre	`` thank you ; but i can not stay this time . look , i have forgotten my own errand ; i brought these strawberries for you , mrs. glendinning , and for pierre ; -- pierre is so wonderfully fond of them . ''
melville	pierre	`` i was audacious enough to think as much , '' cried pierre , `` for you _and_ me , you see , mother ; for you _and_ me , you understand that , i hope . '' `` perfectly , my dear brother . ''
melville	pierre	lucy blushed . `` how warm it is , mrs . glendinning . '' `` very warm , lucy . so you wo n't stay to tea ? '' `` no , i must go now ; just a little stroll , that 's all ; good-bye ! now do n't be following me , pierre . mrs. glendinning , will you keep pierre back ? i know you want him ; you were talking over some private affair when i entered ; you both looked so very confidential . ''
melville	pierre	`` and you were not very far from right , lucy , '' said mrs. glendinning , making no sign to stay her departure . `` yes , business of the highest importance , '' said pierre , fixing his eyes upon lucy significantly .
melville	pierre	at this moment , lucy just upon the point of her departure , was hovering near the door ; the setting sun , streaming through the window , bathed her whole form in golden loveliness and light ; that wonderful , and most vivid transparency of her clear welsh complexion , now fairly glowed like rosy snow . her flowing , white , blue-ribboned dress , fleecily invested her . pierre almost thought that she could only depart the house by floating out of the open window , instead of actually stepping from the door . all her aspect to him , was that moment touched with an indescribable gayety , buoyancy , fragility , and an unearthly evanescence .
melville	pierre	youth is no philosopher . not into young pierre 's heart did there then come the thought , that as the glory of the rose endures but for a day , so the full bloom of girlish airiness and bewitchingness , passes from the earth almost as soon ; as jealously absorbed by those frugal elements , which again incorporate that translated girlish bloom , into the first expanding flower-bud . not into young pierre , did there then steal that thought of utmost sadness ; pondering on the inevitable evanescence of all earthly loveliness ; which makes the sweetest things of life only food for ever-devouring and omnivorous melancholy . pierre 's thought was different from this , and yet somehow akin to it .
melville	pierre	this to be my wife ? i that but the other day weighed an hundred and fifty pounds of solid avoirdupois ; -- _i_ to wed this heavenly fleece ? methinks one husbandly embrace would break her airy zone , and she exhale upward to that heaven whence she hath hither come , condensed to mortal sight . it can not be ; i am of heavy earth , and she of airy light . by heaven , but marriage is an impious thing !
melville	pierre	meanwhile , as these things ran through his soul , mrs. glendinning also had thinkings of her own . `` a very beautiful tableau , '' she cried , at last , artistically turning her gay head a little sideways -- '' very beautiful , indeed ; this , i suppose is all premeditated for my entertainment . orpheus finding his eurydice ; or pluto stealing proserpine . admirable ! it might almost stand for either . ''
melville	pierre	`` no , '' said pierre , gravely ; `` it is the last . now , first i see a meaning there . '' yes , he added to himself inwardly , i am pluto stealing proserpine ; and every accepted lover is .
melville	pierre	`` and you would be very stupid , brother pierre , if you did not see something there , '' said his mother , still that way pursuing her own different train of thought . `` the meaning thereof is this : lucy has commanded me to stay you ; but in reality she wants you to go along with her . well , you may go as far as the porch ; but then , you must return , for we have not concluded our little affair , you know . adieu , little lady ! ''
melville	pierre	there was ever a slight degree of affectionate patronizing in the manner of the resplendent , full-blown mrs. glendinning , toward the delicate and shrinking girlhood of young lucy . she treated her very much as she might have treated some surpassingly beautiful and precocious child ; and this was precisely what lucy was . looking beyond the present period , mrs. glendinning could not but perceive , that even in lucy 's womanly maturity , lucy would still be a child to her ; because , she , elated , felt , that in a certain intellectual vigor , so to speak , she was the essential opposite of lucy , whose sympathetic mind and person had both been cast in one mould of wondrous delicacy . but here mrs. glendinning was both right and wrong . so far as she here saw a difference between herself and lucy tartan , she did not err ; but so far -- and that was very far -- as she thought she saw her innate superiority to her in the absolute scale of being , here she very widely and immeasurably erred . for what may be artistically styled angelicalness , this is the highest essence compatible with created being ; and angelicalness hath no vulgar vigor in it . and that thing which very often prompts to the display of any vigor -- which thing , in man or woman , is at bottom nothing but ambition -- this quality is purely earthly , and not angelical . it is false , that any angels fell by reason of ambition . angels never fall ; and never feel ambition . therefore , benevolently , and affectionately , and all-sincerely , as thy heart , oh , mrs. glendinning ! now standest affected toward the fleecy lucy ; still , lady , thou dost very sadly mistake it , when the proud , double-arches of the bright breastplate of thy bosom , expand with secret triumph over one , whom thou so sweetly , but still so patronizingly stylest , the little lucy .
melville	pierre	but ignorant of these further insights , that very superb-looking lady , now waiting pierre 's return from the portico door , sat in a very matronly revery ; her eyes fixed upon the decanter of amber-hued wine before her . whether it was that she somehow saw some lurking analogical similitude between that remarkably slender , and gracefully cut little pint-decanter , brimfull of light , golden wine , or not , there is no absolute telling now . but really , the peculiarly , and reminiscently , and forecastingly complacent expression of her beaming and benevolent countenance , seemed a tell-tale of some conceit very much like the following : -- yes , she 's a very pretty little pint-decanter of a girl : a very pretty little pale sherry pint-decanter of a girl ; and i -- i 'm a quart decanter of -- of -- port -- potent port ! now , sherry for boys , and port for men -- so i 've heard men say ; and pierre is but a boy ; but when his father wedded me , -- why , his father was turned of five-and-thirty years .
melville	pierre	after a little further waiting for him , mrs. glendinning heard pierre 's voice -- '' yes , before eight o'clock at least , lucy -- no fear ; '' and then the hall door banged , and pierre returned to her .
melville	pierre	but now she found that this unforeseen visit of lucy had completely routed all business capacity in her mercurial son ; fairly capsizing him again into , there was no telling what sea of pleasant pensiveness .
melville	pierre	`` dear me ! some other time , sister mary . '' `` not this time ; that is very certain , pierre . upon my word i shall have to get lucy kidnapped , and temporarily taken out of the country , and you handcuffed to the table , else there will be no having a preliminary understanding with you , previous to calling in the lawyers . well , i shall yet manage you , one way or other . good-bye , pierre ; i see you do n't want me now . i suppose i sha n't see you till to-morrow morning . luckily , i have a very interesting book to read . adieu ! ''
melville	pierre	but pierre remained in his chair ; his gaze fixed upon the stilly sunset beyond the meadows , and far away to the now golden hills . a glorious , softly glorious , and most gracious evening , which seemed plainly a tongue to all humanity , saying : i go down in beauty to rise in joy ; love reigns throughout all worlds that sunsets visit ; it is a foolish ghost story ; there is no such thing as misery . would love , which is omnipotent , have misery in his domain ? would the god of sunlight decree gloom ? it is a flawless , speckless , fleckless , beautiful world throughout ; joy now , and joy forever !
melville	pierre	then the face , which before had seemed mournfully and reproachfully looking out upon him from the effulgent sunset 's heart ; the face slid from him ; and left alone there with his soul 's joy , thinking that that very night he would utter the magic word of marriage to his lucy ; not a happier youth than pierre glendinning sat watching that day 's sun go down .
melville	pierre	iv . after this morning of gayety , this noon of tragedy , and this evening so full of chequered pensiveness ; pierre now possessed his soul in joyful mildness and steadfastness ; feeling none of that wild anguish of anticipative rapture , which , in weaker minds , too often dislodges love 's sweet bird from her nest .
melville	pierre	the early night was warm , but dark -- for the moon was not risen yet -- and as pierre passed on beneath the pendulous canopies of the long arms of the weeping elms of the village , an almost impenetrable blackness surrounded him , but entered not the gently illuminated halls of his heart . he had not gone very far , when in the distance beyond , he noticed a light moving along the opposite side of the road , and slowly approaching . as it was the custom for some of the more elderly , and perhaps timid inhabitants of the village , to carry a lantern when going abroad of so dark a night , this object conveyed no impression of novelty to pierre ; still , as it silently drew nearer and nearer , the one only distinguishable thing before him , he somehow felt a nameless presentiment that the light must be seeking him . he had nearly gained the cottage door , when the lantern crossed over toward him ; and as his nimble hand was laid at last upon the little wicket-gate , which he thought was now to admit him to so much delight ; a heavy hand was laid upon himself , and at the same moment , the lantern was lifted toward his face , by a hooded and obscure-looking figure , whose half-averted countenance he could but indistinctly discern . but pierre 's own open aspect , seemed to have been quickly scrutinized by the other .
melville	pierre	`` i have a letter for pierre glendinning , '' said the stranger , `` and i believe this is he . '' at the same moment , a letter was drawn forth , and sought his hand . `` for me ! '' exclaimed pierre , faintly , starting at the strangeness of the encounter ; -- '' methinks this is an odd time and place to deliver your mail ; -- who are you ? -- stay ! ''
melville	pierre	but without waiting an answer , the messenger had already turned about , and was re-crossing the road . in the first impulse of the moment , pierre stept forward , and would have pursued him ; but smiling at his own causeless curiosity and trepidation , paused again ; and softly turned over the letter in his hand . what mysterious correspondent is this , thought he , circularly moving his thumb upon the seal ; no one writes me but from abroad ; and their letters come through the office ; and as for lucy -- pooh ! -- when she herself is within , she would hardly have her notes delivered at her own gate . strange ! but i 'll in , and read it ; -- no , not that ; -- i come to read again in her own sweet heart -- that dear missive to me from heaven , -- and this impertinent letter would pre-occupy me . i 'll wait till i go home .
melville	pierre	he entered the gate , and laid his hand upon the cottage knocker . its sudden coolness caused a slight , and , at any other time , an unaccountable sympathetic sensation in his hand . to his unwonted mood , the knocker seemed to say -- '' enter not ! -- begone , and first read thy note . ''
melville	pierre	yielding now , half alarmed , and half bantering with himself , to these shadowy interior monitions , he half-unconsciously quitted the door ; repassed the gate ; and soon found himself retracing his homeward path .
melville	pierre	he equivocated with himself no more ; the gloom of the air had now burst into his heart , and extinguished its light ; then , first in all his life , pierre felt the irresistible admonitions and intuitions of fate .
melville	pierre	he entered the hall unnoticed , passed up to his chamber , and hurriedly locking the door in the dark , lit his lamp . as the summoned flame illuminated the room , pierre , standing before the round center-table , where the lamp was placed , with his hand yet on the brass circle which regulated the wick , started at a figure in the opposite mirror . it bore the outline of pierre , but now strangely filled with features transformed , and unfamiliar to him ; feverish eagerness , fear , and nameless forebodings of ill ! he threw himself into a chair , and for a time vainly struggled with the incomprehensible power that possessed him . then , as he avertedly drew the letter from his bosom , he whispered to himself -- out on thee , pierre ! how sheepish now will ye feel when this tremendous note will turn out to be an invitation to a supper to-morrow night ; quick , fool , and write the stereotyped reply : mr. pierre glendinning will be very happy to accept miss so and so 's polite invitation .
melville	pierre	still for the moment he held the letter averted . the messenger had so hurriedly accosted him , and delivered his duty , that pierre had not yet so much as gained one glance at the superscription of the note . and now the wild thought passed through his mind of what would be the result , should he deliberately destroy the note , without so much as looking at the hand that had addressed it . hardly had this half-crazy conceit fully made itself legible in his soul , when he was conscious of his two hands meeting in the middle of the sundered note ! he leapt from his chair -- by heaven ! he murmured , unspeakably shocked at the intensity of that mood which had caused him unwittingly as it were , to do for the first time in his whole life , an act of which he was privately ashamed . though the mood that was on him was none of his own willful seeking ; yet now he swiftly felt conscious that he had perhaps a little encouraged it , through that certain strange infatuation of fondness , which the human mind , however vigorous , sometimes feels for any emotion at once novel and mystical . not willingly , at such times -- never mind how fearful we may be -- do we try to dissolve the spell which seems , for the time , to admit us , all astonished , into the vague vestibule of the spiritual worlds .
melville	pierre	pierre now seemed distinctly to feel two antagonistic agencies within him ; one of which was just struggling into his consciousness , and each of which was striving for the mastery ; and between whose respective final ascendencies , he thought he could perceive , though but shadowly , that he himself was to be the only umpire . one bade him finish the selfish destruction of the note ; for in some dark way the reading of it would irretrievably entangle his fate . the other bade him dismiss all misgivings ; not because there was no possible ground for them , but because to dismiss them was the manlier part , never mind what might betide . this good angel seemed mildly to say -- read , pierre , though by reading thou may'st entangle thyself , yet may'st thou thereby disentangle others . read , and feel that best blessedness which , with the sense of all duties discharged , holds happiness indifferent . the bad angel insinuatingly breathed -- read it not , dearest pierre ; but destroy it , and be happy . then , at the blast of his noble heart , the bad angel shrunk up into nothingness ; and the good one defined itself clearer and more clear , and came nigher and more nigh to him , smiling sadly but benignantly ; while forth from the infinite distances wonderful harmonies stole into his heart ; so that every vein in him pulsed to some heavenly swell .
melville	pierre	v. `` the name at the end of this letter will be wholly strange to thee . hitherto my existence has been utterly unknown to thee . this letter will touch thee and pain thee . willingly would i spare thee , but i can not . my heart bears me witness , that did i think that the suffering these lines would give thee , would , in the faintest degree , compare with what mine has been , i would forever withhold them .
melville	pierre	`` pierre glendinning , thou art not the only child of thy father ; in the eye of the sun , the hand that traces this is thy sister 's ; yes , pierre , isabel calls thee her brother -- her brother ! oh , sweetest of words , which so often i have thought to myself , and almost deemed it profanity for an outcast like me to speak or think . dearest pierre , my brother , my own father 's child ! art thou an angel , that thou canst overleap all the heartless usages and fashions of a banded world , that will call thee fool , fool , fool ! and curse thee , if thou yieldest to that heavenly impulse which alone can lead thee to respond to the long tyrannizing , and now at last unquenchable yearnings of my bursting heart ? oh , my brother !
melville	pierre	`` but , pierre glendinning , i will be proud with thee . let not my hapless condition extinguish in me , the nobleness which i equally inherit with thee . thou shall not be cozened , by my tears and my anguish , into any thing which thy most sober hour will repent . read no further . if it suit thee , burn this letter ; so shalt thou escape the certainty of that knowledge , which , if thou art now cold and selfish , may hereafter , in some maturer , remorseful , and helpless hour , cause thee a poignant upbraiding . no , i shall not , i will not implore thee. -- oh , my brother , my dear , dear pierre , -- help me , fly to me ; see , i perish without thee ; -- pity , pity , -- here i freeze in the wide , wide world ; -- no father , no mother , no sister , no brother , no living thing in the fair form of humanity , that holds me dear . no more , oh no more , dear pierre , can i endure to be an outcast in the world , for which the dear savior died . fly to me , pierre ; -- nay , i could tear what i now write , -- as i have torn so many other sheets , all written for thy eye , but which never reached thee , because in my distraction , i knew not how to write to thee , nor what to say to thee ; and so , behold again how i rave .
melville	pierre	`` nothing more ; i will write no more ; -- silence becomes this grave ; -- the heart-sickness steals over me , pierre , my brother . `` scarce know i what i have written . yet will i write thee the fatal line , and leave all the rest to thee , pierre , my brother. -- she that is called isabel banford dwells in the little red farm-house , three miles from the village , on the slope toward the lake . to-morrow night-fall -- not before -- not by day , not by day , pierre .
melville	pierre	thy sister , isabel . '' vi . this letter , inscribed in a feminine , but irregular hand , and in some places almost illegible , plainly attesting the state of the mind which had dictated it ; -- stained , too , here and there , with spots of tears , which chemically acted upon by the ink , assumed a strange and reddish hue -- as if blood and not tears had dropped upon the sheet ; -- and so completely torn in two by pierre 's own hand , that it indeed seemed the fit scroll of a torn , as well as bleeding heart ; -- this amazing letter , deprived pierre for the time of all lucid and definite thought or feeling . he hung half-lifeless in his chair ; his hand , clutching the letter , was pressed against his heart , as if some assassin had stabbed him and fled ; and pierre was now holding the dagger in the wound , to stanch the outgushing of the blood .
melville	pierre	ay , pierre , now indeed art thou hurt with a wound , never to be completely healed but in heaven ; for thee , the before undistrusted moral beauty of the world is forever fled ; for thee , thy sacred father is no more a saint ; all brightness hath gone from thy hills , and all peace from thy plains ; and now , now , for the first time , pierre , truth rolls a black billow through thy soul ! ah , miserable thou , to whom truth , in her first tides , bears nothing but wrecks !
melville	pierre	the perceptible forms of things ; the shapes of thoughts ; the pulses of life , but slowly came back to pierre . and as the mariner , shipwrecked and cast on the beach , has much ado to escape the recoil of the wave that hurled him there ; so pierre long struggled , and struggled , to escape the recoil of that anguish , which had dashed him out of itself , upon the beach of his swoon .
melville	pierre	but man was not made to succumb to the villain woe . youth is not young and a wrestler in vain . pierre staggeringly rose to his feet ; his wide eyes fixed , and his whole form in a tremble .
melville	pierre	`` myself am left , at least , '' he slowly and half-chokingly murmured . `` with myself i front thee ! unhand me all fears , and unlock me all spells ! henceforth i will know nothing but truth ; glad truth , or sad truth ; i will know what is , and do what my deepest angel dictates. -- the letter ! -- isabel , -- sister , -- brother , -- me , _me_ -- my sacred father ! -- this is some accursed dream ! -- nay , but this paper thing is forged , -- a base and malicious forgery , i swear ; -- well didst thou hide thy face from me , thou vile lanterned messenger , that didst accost me on the threshold of joy , with this lying warrant of woe ! doth truth come in the dark , and steal on us , and rob us so , and then depart , deaf to all pursuing invocations ? if this night , which now wraps my soul , be genuine as that which now wraps this half of the world ; then fate , i have a choice quarrel with thee . thou art a palterer and a cheat ; thou hast lured me on through gay gardens to a gulf . oh ! falsely guided in the days of my joy , am i now truly led in this night of my grief ? -- i will be a raver , and none shall stay me ! i will lift my hand in fury , for am i not struck ? i will be bitter in my breath , for is not this cup of gall ? thou black knight , that with visor down , thus confrontest me , and mockest at me ; lo ! i strike through thy helm , and will see thy face , be it gorgon ! -- let me go , ye fond affections ; all piety leave me ; -- i will be impious , for piety hath juggled me , and taught me to revere , where i should spurn . from all idols , i tear all veils ; henceforth i will see the hidden things ; and live right out in my own hidden life ! -- now i feel that nothing but truth can move me so . this letter is not a forgery . oh ! isabel , thou art my sister ; and i will love thee , and protect thee , ay , and own thee through all . ah ! forgive me , ye heavens , for my ignorant ravings , and accept this my vow. -- here i swear myself isabel 's . oh ! thou poor castaway girl , that in loneliness and anguish must have long breathed that same air , which i have only inhaled for delight ; thou who must even now be weeping , and weeping , cast into an ocean of uncertainty as to thy fate , which heaven hath placed in my hands ; sweet isabel ! would i not be baser than brass , and harder , and colder than ice , if i could be insensible to such claims as thine ? thou movest before me , in rainbows spun of thy tears ! i see thee long weeping , and god demands me for thy comforter ; and comfort thee , stand by thee , and fight for thee , will thy leapingly-acknowledging brother , whom thy own father named pierre !

melville	pierre	he could not stay in his chamber : the house contracted to a nut-shell around him ; the walls smote his forehead ; bare-headed he rushed from the place , and only in the infinite air , found scope for that boundless expansion of his life .
melville	pierre	book iv . retrospective . i . in their precise tracings-out and subtile causations , the strongest and fieriest emotions of life defy all analytical insight . we see the cloud , and feel its bolt ; but meteorology only idly essays a critical scrutiny as to how that cloud became charged , and how this bolt so stuns . the metaphysical writers confess , that the most impressive , sudden , and overwhelming event , as well as the minutest , is but the product of an infinite series of infinitely involved and untraceable foregoing occurrences . just so with every motion of the heart . why this cheek kindles with a noble enthusiasm ; why that lip curls in scorn ; these are things not wholly imputable to the immediate apparent cause , which is only one link in the chain ; but to a long line of dependencies whose further part is lost in the mid-regions of the impalpable air .
melville	pierre	idle then would it be to attempt by any winding way so to penetrate into the heart , and memory , and inmost life , and nature of pierre , as to show why it was that a piece of intelligence which , in the natural course of things , many amiable gentlemen , both young and old , have been known to receive with a momentary feeling of surprise , and then a little curiosity to know more , and at last an entire unconcern ; idle would it be , to attempt to show how to pierre it rolled down on his soul like melted lava , and left so deep a deposit of desolation , that all his subsequent endeavors never restored the original temples to the soil , nor all his culture completely revived its buried bloom .
melville	pierre	but some random hints may suffice to deprive a little of its strangeness , that tumultuous mood , into which so small a note had thrown him . there had long stood a shrine in the fresh-foliaged heart of pierre , up to which he ascended by many tableted steps of remembrance ; and around which annually he had hung fresh wreaths of a sweet and holy affection . made one green bower of at last , by such successive votive offerings of his being ; this shrine seemed , and was indeed , a place for the celebration of a chastened joy , rather than for any melancholy rites . but though thus mantled , and tangled with garlands , this shrine was of marble -- a niched pillar , deemed solid and eternal , and from whose top radiated all those innumerable sculptured scrolls and branches , which supported the entire one-pillared temple of his moral life ; as in some beautiful gothic oratories , one central pillar , trunk-like , upholds the roof . in this shrine , in this niche of this pillar , stood the perfect marble form of his departed father ; without blemish , unclouded , snow-white , and serene ; pierre 's fond personification of perfect human goodness and virtue . before this shrine , pierre poured out the fullness of all young life 's most reverential thoughts and beliefs . not to god had pierre ever gone in his heart , unless by ascending the steps of that shrine , and so making it the vestibule of his abstractest religion .
melville	pierre	blessed and glorified in his tomb beyond prince mausolus is that mortal sire , who , after an honorable , pure course of life , dies , and is buried , as in a choice fountain , in the filial breast of a tender-hearted and intellectually appreciative child . for at that period , the solomonic insights have not poured their turbid tributaries into the pure-flowing well of the childish life . rare preservative virtue , too , have those heavenly waters . thrown into that fountain , all sweet recollections become marbleized ; so that things which in themselves were evanescent , thus became unchangeable and eternal . so , some rare waters in derbyshire will petrify birds'-nests . but if fate preserves the father to a later time , too often the filial obsequies are less profound ; the canonization less ethereal . the eye-expanded boy perceives , or vaguely thinks he perceives , slight specks and flaws in the character he once so wholly reverenced .
melville	pierre	when pierre was twelve years old , his father had died , leaving behind him , in the general voice of the world , a marked reputation as a gentleman and a christian ; in the heart of his wife , a green memory of many healthy days of unclouded and joyful wedded life , and in the inmost soul of pierre , the impression of a bodily form of rare manly beauty and benignity , only rivaled by the supposed perfect mould in which his virtuous heart had been cast . of pensive evenings , by the wide winter fire , or in summer , in the southern piazza , when that mystical night-silence so peculiar to the country would summon up in the minds of pierre and his mother , long trains of the images of the past ; leading all that spiritual procession , majestically and holily walked the venerated form of the departed husband and father . then their talk would be reminiscent and serious , but sweet ; and again , and again , still deep and deeper , was stamped in pierre 's soul the cherished conceit , that his virtuous father , so beautiful on earth , was now uncorruptibly sainted in heaven . so choicely , and in some degree , secludedly nurtured , pierre , though now arrived at the age of nineteen , had never yet become so thoroughly initiated into that darker , though truer aspect of things , which an entire residence in the city from the earliest period of life , almost inevitably engraves upon the mind of any keenly observant and reflective youth of pierre 's present years . so that up to this period , in his breast , all remained as it had been ; and to pierre , his father 's shrine seemed spotless , and still new as the marble of the tomb of him of arimathea .
melville	pierre	judge , then , how all-desolating and withering the blast , that for pierre , in one night , stripped his holiest shrine of all over-laid bloom , and buried the mild statue of the saint beneath the prostrated ruins of the soul 's temple itself .
melville	pierre	ii . as the vine flourishes , and the grape empurples close up to the very walls and muzzles of cannoned ehrenbreitstein ; so do the sweetest joys of life grow in the very jaws of its perils .
melville	pierre	but is life , indeed , a thing for all infidel levities , and we , its misdeemed beneficiaries , so utterly fools and infatuate , that what we take to be our strongest tower of delight , only stands at the caprice of the minutest event -- the falling of a leaf , the hearing of a voice , or the receipt of one little bit of paper scratched over with a few small characters by a sharpened feather ? are we so entirely insecure , that that casket , wherein we have placed our holiest and most final joy , and which we have secured by a lock of infinite deftness ; can that casket be picked and desecrated at the merest stranger 's touch , when we think that we alone hold the only and chosen key ?
melville	pierre	pierre ! thou art foolish ; rebuild -- no , not that , for thy shrine still stands ; it stands , pierre , firmly stands ; smellest thou not its yet undeparted , embowering bloom ? such a note as thine can be easily enough written , pierre ; impostors are not unknown in this curious world ; or the brisk novelist , pierre , will write thee fifty such notes , and so steal gushing tears from his reader 's eyes ; even as _thy_ note so strangely made thine own manly eyes so arid ; so glazed , and so arid , pierre -- foolish pierre !
melville	pierre	oh ! mock not the poniarded heart . the stabbed man knows the steel ; prate not to him that it is only a tickling feather . feels he not the interior gash ? what does this blood on my vesture ? and what does this pang in my soul ?
melville	pierre	and here again , not unreasonably , might invocations go up to those three weird ones , that tend life 's loom . again we might ask them , what threads were those , oh , ye weird ones , that ye wove in the years foregone ; that now to pierre , they so unerringly conduct electric presentiments , that his woe is woe , his father no more a saint , and isabel a sister indeed ?
melville	pierre	ah , fathers and mothers ! all the world round , be heedful , -- give heed ! thy little one may not now comprehend the meaning of those words and those signs , by which , in its innocent presence , thou thinkest to disguise the sinister thing ye would hint . not now he knows ; not very much even of the externals he consciously remarks ; but if , in after-life , fate puts the chemic key of the cipher into his hands ; then how swiftly and how wonderfully , he reads all the obscurest and most obliterate inscriptions he finds in his memory ; yea , and rummages himself all over , for still hidden writings to read . oh , darkest lessons of life have thus been read ; all faith in virtue been murdered , and youth gives itself up to an infidel scorn .
melville	pierre	but not thus , altogether , was it now with pierre ; yet so like , in some points , that the above true warning may not misplacedly stand . his father had died of a fever ; and , as is not uncommon in such maladies , toward his end , he at intervals lowly wandered in his mind . at such times , by unobserved , but subtle arts , the devoted family attendants , had restrained his wife from being present at his side . but little pierre , whose fond , filial love drew him ever to that bed ; they heeded not innocent little pierre , when his father was delirious ; and so , one evening , when the shadows intermingled with the curtains ; and all the chamber was hushed ; and pierre but dimly saw his father 's face ; and the fire on the hearth lay in a broken temple of wonderful coals ; then a strange , plaintive , infinitely pitiable , low voice , stole forth from the testered bed ; and pierre heard , -- '' my daughter ! my daughter ! ''
melville	pierre	`` he wanders again , '' said the nurse . `` dear , dear father ! '' sobbed the child -- '' thou hast not a daughter , but here is thy own little pierre . '' but again the unregardful voice in the bed was heard ; and now in a sudden , pealing wail , -- '' my daughter ! -- god ! god ! -- my daughter ! ''
melville	pierre	the child snatched the dying man 's hand ; it faintly grew to his grasp ; but on the other side of the bed , the other hand now also emptily lifted itself and emptily caught , as if at some other childish fingers . then both hands dropped on the sheet ; and in the twinkling shadows of the evening little pierre seemed to see , that while the hand which he held wore a faint , feverish flush , the other empty one was ashy white as a leper 's .
melville	pierre	`` it is past , '' whispered the nurse , `` he will wander so no more now till midnight , -- that is his wont . '' and then , in her heart , she wondered how it was , that so excellent a gentleman , and so thoroughly good a man , should wander so ambiguously in his mind ; and trembled to think of that mysterious thing in the soul , which seems to acknowledge no human jurisdiction , but in spite of the individual 's own innocent self , will still dream horrid dreams , and mutter unmentionable thoughts ; and into pierre 's awe-stricken , childish soul , there entered a kindred , though still more nebulous conceit . but it belonged to the spheres of the impalpable ether ; and the child soon threw other and sweeter remembrances over it , and covered it up ; and at last , it was blended with all other dim things , and imaginings of dimness ; and so , seemed to survive to no real life in pierre . but though through many long years the henbane showed no leaves in his soul ; yet the sunken seed was there : and the first glimpse of isabel 's letter caused it to spring forth , as by magic . then , again , the long-hushed , plaintive and infinitely pitiable voice was heard , -- '' my daughter ! my daughter ! '' followed by the compunctious `` god ! god ! '' and to pierre , once again the empty hand lifted itself , and once again the ashy hand fell .
melville	pierre	iii . in the cold courts of justice the dull head demands oaths , and holy writ proofs ; but in the warm halls of the heart one single , untestified memory 's spark shall suffice to enkindle such a blaze of evidence , that all the corners of conviction are as suddenly lighted up as a midnight city by a burning building , which on every side whirls its reddened brands .
melville	pierre	in a locked , round-windowed closet connecting with the chamber of pierre , and whither he had always been wont to go , in those sweetly awful hours , when the spirit crieth to the spirit , come into solitude with me , twin-brother ; come away : a secret have i ; let me whisper it to thee aside ; in this closet , sacred to the tadmore privacies and repose of the sometimes solitary pierre , there hung , by long cords from the cornice , a small portrait in oil , before which pierre had many a time trancedly stood . had this painting hung in any annual public exhibition , and in its turn been described in print by the casual glancing critics , they would probably have described it thus , and truthfully : `` an impromptu portrait of a fine-looking , gay-hearted , youthful gentleman . he is lightly , and , as it were , airily and but grazingly seated in , or rather flittingly tenanting an old-fashioned chair of malacca . one arm confining his hat and cane is loungingly thrown over the back of the chair , while the fingers of the other hand play with his gold watch-seal and key . the free-templed head is sideways turned , with a peculiarly bright , and care-free , morning expression . he seems as if just dropped in for a visit upon some familiar acquaintance . altogether , the painting is exceedingly clever and cheerful ; with a fine , off-handed expression about it . undoubtedly a portrait , and no fancy-piece ; and , to hazard a vague conjecture , by an amateur . ''
melville	pierre	so bright , and so cheerful then ; so trim , and so young ; so singularly healthful , and handsome ; what subtile element could so steep this whole portrait , that , to the wife of the original , it was namelessly unpleasant and repelling ? the mother of pierre could never abide this picture which she had always asserted did signally belie her husband . her fond memories of the departed refused to hang one single wreath around it . it is not he , she would emphatically and almost indignantly exclaim , when more urgently besought to reveal the cause for so unreasonable a dissent from the opinion of nearly all the other connections and relatives of the deceased . but the portrait which she held to do justice to her husband , correctly to convey his features in detail , and more especially their truest , and finest , and noblest combined expression ; this portrait was a much larger one , and in the great drawing-room below occupied the most conspicuous and honorable place on the wall .
melville	pierre	even to pierre these two paintings had always seemed strangely dissimilar . and as the larger one had been painted many years after the other , and therefore brought the original pretty nearly within his own childish recollections ; therefore , he himself could not but deem it by far the more truthful and life-like presentation of his father . so that the mere preference of his mother , however strong , was not at all surprising to him , but rather coincided with his own conceit . yet not for this , must the other portrait be so decidedly rejected . because , in the first place , there was a difference in time , and some difference of costume to be considered , and the wide difference of the styles of the respective artiste , and the wide difference of those respective , semi-reflected , ideal faces , which , even in the presence of the original , a spiritual artist will rather choose to draw from than from the fleshy face , however brilliant and fine . moreover , while the larger portrait was that of a middle-aged , married man , and seemed to possess all the nameless and slightly portly tranquillities , incident to that condition when a felicitous one ; the smaller portrait painted a brisk , unentangled , young bachelor , gayly ranging up and down in the world ; light-hearted , and a very little bladish perhaps ; and charged to the lips with the first uncloying morning fullness and freshness of life . here , certainly , large allowance was to be made in any careful , candid estimation of these portraits . to pierre this conclusion had become well-nigh irresistible , when he placed side by side two portraits of himself ; one taken in his early childhood , a frocked and belted boy of four years old ; and the other , a grown youth of sixteen . except an indestructible , all-surviving something in the eyes and on the temples , pierre could hardly recognize the loud-laughing boy in the tall , and pensively smiling youth . if a few years , then , can have in me made all this difference , why not in my father ? thought pierre .
melville	pierre	besides all this , pierre considered the history , and , so to speak , the family legend of the smaller painting . in his fifteenth year , it was made a present to him by an old maiden aunt , who resided in the city , and who cherished the memory of pierre 's father , with all that wonderful amaranthine devotion which an advanced maiden sister ever feels for the idea of a beloved younger brother , now dead and irrevocably gone . as the only child of that brother , pierre was an object of the warmest and most extravagant attachment on the part of this lonely aunt , who seemed to see , transformed into youth once again , the likeness , and very soul of her brother , in the fair , inheriting brow of pierre . though the portrait we speak of was inordinately prized by her , yet at length the strict canon of her romantic and imaginative love asserted the portrait to be pierre 's -- for pierre was not only his father 's only child , but his namesake -- so soon as pierre should be old enough to value aright so holy and inestimable a treasure . she had accordingly sent it to him , trebly boxed , and finally covered with a water-proof cloth ; and it was delivered at saddle meadows , by an express , confidential messenger , an old gentleman of leisure , once her forlorn , because rejected gallant , but now her contented , and chatty neighbor . henceforth , before a gold-framed and gold-lidded ivory miniature , -- a fraternal gift -- aunt dorothea now offered up her morning and her evening rites , to the memory of the noblest and handsomest of brothers . yet an annual visit to the far closet of pierre -- no slight undertaking now for one so stricken in years , and every way infirm -- attested the earnestness of that strong sense of duty , that painful renunciation of self , which had induced her voluntarily to part with the precious memorial .
melville	pierre	iv . `` tell me , aunt , '' the child pierre had early said to her , long before the portrait became his -- '' tell me , aunt , how this chair-portrait , as you call it , was painted ; -- who painted it ? -- whose chair was this ? -- have you the chair now ? -- i do n't see it in your room here ; -- what is papa looking at so strangely ? -- i should like to know now , what papa was thinking of , then . do , now , dear aunt , tell me all about this picture , so that when it is mine , as you promise me , i shall know its whole history . ''
melville	pierre	`` sit down , then , and be very still and attentive , my dear child , '' said aunt dorothea ; while she a little averted her head , and tremulously and inaccurately sought her pocket , till little pierre cried -- '' why , aunt , the story of the picture is not in any little book , is it , that you are going to take out and read to me ? ''
melville	pierre	`` my handkerchief , my child . '' `` why , aunt , here it is , at your elbow ; here , on the table ; here , aunt ; take it , do ; oh , do n't tell me any thing about the picture , now ; i wo n't hear it . ''
melville	pierre	`` be still , my darling pierre , '' said his aunt , taking the handkerchief , `` draw the curtain a little , dearest ; the light hurts my eyes . now , go into the closet , and bring me my dark shawl ; -- take your time. -- there ; thank you , pierre ; now sit down again , and i will begin. -- the picture was painted long ago , my child ; you were not born then . ''
melville	pierre	`` not born ? '' cried little pierre . `` not born , '' said his aunt . `` well , go on , aunt ; but do n't tell me again that once upon a time i was not little pierre at all , and yet my father was alive . go on , aunt , -- do , do ! ''
melville	pierre	`` why , how nervous you are getting , my child ; -- be patient ; i am very old , pierre ; and old people never like to be hurried . '' `` now , my own dear aunt dorothea , do forgive me this once , and go on with your story . ''
melville	pierre	`` when your poor father was quite a young man , my child , and was on one of his long autumnal visits to his friends in this city , he was rather intimate at times with a cousin of his , ralph winwood , who was about his own age , -- a fine youth he was , too , pierre . ''
melville	pierre	`` i never saw him , aunt ; pray , where is he now ? '' interrupted pierre ; -- '' does he live in the country , now , as mother and i do ? '' `` yes , my child ; but a far-away , beautiful country , i hope ; -- he 's in heaven , i trust . ''
melville	pierre	`` dead , '' sighed little pierre -- '' go on , aunt . '' `` now , cousin ralph had a great love for painting , my child ; and he spent many hours in a room , hung all round with pictures and portraits ; and there he had his easel and brushes ; and much liked to paint his friends , and hang their faces on his walls ; so that when all alone by himself , he yet had plenty of company , who always wore their best expressions to him , and never once ruffled him , by ever getting cross or ill-natured , little pierre . often , he had besought your father to sit to him ; saying , that his silent circle of friends would never be complete , till your father consented to join them . but in those days , my child , your father was always in motion . it was hard for me to get him to stand still , while i tied his cravat ; for he never came to any one but me for that . so he was always putting off , and putting off cousin ralph . 'some other time , cousin ; not to-day ; -- to-morrow , perhaps ; -- or next week ; ' -- and so , at last cousin ralph began to despair . but i 'll catch him yet , cried sly cousin ralph . so now he said nothing more to your father about the matter of painting him ; but every pleasant morning kept his easel and brushes and every thing in readiness ; so as to be ready the first moment your father should chance to drop in upon him from his long strolls ; for it was now and then your father 's wont to pay flying little visits to cousin ralph in his painting-room. -- but , my child , you may draw back the curtain now -- it 's getting very dim here , seems to me . ''
melville	pierre	`` well , i thought so all along , aunt , '' said little pierre , obeying ; `` but did n't you say the light hurt your eyes . '' `` but it does not now , little pierre . '' `` well , well ; go on , go on , aunt ; you ca n't think how interested i am , '' said little pierre , drawing his stool close up to the quilted satin hem of his good aunt dorothea 's dress .
melville	pierre	`` i will , my child . but first let me tell you , that about this time there arrived in the port , a cabin-full of french emigrants of quality ; -- poor people , pierre , who were forced to fly from their native land , because of the cruel , blood-shedding times there . but you have read all that in the little history i gave you , a good while ago . ''
melville	pierre	`` i know all about it ; -- the french revolution , '' said little pierre . `` what a famous little scholar you are , my dear child , '' -- said aunt dorothea , faintly smiling -- '' among those poor , but noble emigrants , there was a beautiful young girl , whose sad fate afterward made a great noise in the city , and made many eyes to weep , but in vain , for she never was heard of any more . ''
melville	pierre	`` how ? how ? aunt ; -- i do n't understand ; -- did she disappear then , aunt ? '' `` i was a little before my story , child . yes , she did disappear , and never was heard of again ; but that was afterward , some time afterward , my child . i am very sure it was ; i could take my oath of that , pierre . ''
melville	pierre	`` why , dear aunt , '' said little pierre , `` how earnestly you talk -- after what ? your voice is getting very strange ; do now ; -- do n't talk that way ; you frighten me so , aunt . '' `` perhaps it is this bad cold i have to-day ; it makes my voice a little hoarse , i fear , pierre . but i will try and not talk so hoarsely again . well , my child , some time before this beautiful young lady disappeared , indeed it was only shortly after the poor emigrants landed , your father made her acquaintance ; and with many other humane gentlemen of the city , provided for the wants of the strangers , for they were very poor indeed , having been stripped of every thing , save a little trifling jewelry , which could not go very far . at last , the friends of your father endeavored to dissuade him from visiting these people so much ; they were fearful that as the young lady was so very beautiful , and a little inclined to be intriguing -- so some said -- your father might be tempted to marry her ; which would not have been a wise thing in him ; for though the young lady might have been very beautiful , and good-hearted , yet no one on this side the water certainly knew her history ; and she was a foreigner ; and would not have made so suitable and excellent a match for your father as your dear mother afterward did , my child . but , for myself , i -- who always knew your father very well in all his intentions , and he was very confidential with me , too -- i , for my part , never credited that he would do so unwise a thing as marry the strange young lady . at any rate , he at last discontinued his visits to the emigrants ; and it was after this that the young lady disappeared . some said that she must have voluntarily but secretly returned into her own country ; and others declared that she must have been kidnapped by french emissaries ; for , after her disappearance , rumor began to hint that she was of the noblest birth , and some ways allied to the royal family ; and then , again , there were some who shook their heads darkly , and muttered of drownings , and other dark things ; which one always hears hinted when people disappear , and no one can find them . but though your father and many other gentlemen moved heaven and earth to find trace of her , yet , as i said before , my child , she never re-appeared . ''
melville	pierre	`` the poor french lady ! '' sighed little pierre . `` aunt , i 'm afraid she was murdered . '' `` poor lady , there is no telling , '' said his aunt . `` but listen , for i am coming to the picture again . now , at the time your father was so often visiting the emigrants , my child , cousin ralph was one of those who a little fancied that your father was courting her ; but cousin ralph being a quiet young man , and a scholar , not well acquainted with what is wise , or what is foolish in the great world ; cousin ralph would not have been at all mortified had your father really wedded with the refugee young lady . so vainly thinking , as i told you , that your father was courting her , he fancied it would be a very fine thing if he could paint your father as her wooer ; that is , paint him just after his coming from his daily visits to the emigrants . so he watched his chance ; every thing being ready in his painting-room , as i told you before ; and one morning , sure enough , in dropt your father from his walk . but before he came into the room , cousin ralph had spied him from the window ; and when your father entered , cousin ralph had the sitting-chair ready drawn out , back of his easel , but still fronting toward him , and pretended to be very busy painting . he said to your father -- 'glad to see you , cousin pierre ; i am just about something here ; sit right down there now , and tell me the news ; and i 'll sally out with you presently . and tell us something of the emigrants , cousin pierre , ' he slyly added -- wishing , you see , to get your father 's thoughts running that supposed wooing way , so that he might catch some sort of corresponding expression you see , little pierre . ''
melville	pierre	`` i do n't know that i precisely understand , aunt ; but go on , i am so interested ; do go on , dear aunt . '' `` well , by many little cunning shifts and contrivances , cousin ralph kept your father there sitting , and sitting in the chair , rattling and rattling away , and so self-forgetful too , that he never heeded that all the while sly cousin ralph was painting and painting just as fast as ever he could ; and only making believe laugh at your father 's wit ; in short , cousin ralph was stealing his portrait , my child . ''
melville	pierre	`` not _stealing_ it , i hope , '' said pierre , `` that would be very wicked . '' `` well , then , we wo n't call it stealing , since i am sure that cousin ralph kept your father all the time off from him , and so , could not have possibly picked his pocket , though indeed , he slyly picked his portrait , so to speak . and if indeed it was stealing , or any thing of that sort ; yet seeing how much comfort that portrait has been to me , pierre , and how much it will yet be to you , i hope ; i think we must very heartily forgive cousin ralph , for what he then did . ''
melville	pierre	`` yes , i think we must indeed , '' chimed in little pierre , now eagerly eying the very portrait in question , which hung over the mantle . `` well , by catching your father two or three times more in that way , cousin ralph at last finished the painting ; and when it was all framed , and every way completed , he would have surprised your father by hanging it boldly up in his room among his other portraits , had not your father one morning suddenly come to him -- while , indeed , the very picture itself was placed face down on a table and cousin ralph fixing the cord to it -- came to him , and frightened cousin ralph by quietly saying , that now that he thought of it , it seemed to him that cousin ralph had been playing tricks with him ; but he hoped it was not so . 'what do you mean ? ' said cousin ralph , a little flurried . 'you have not been hanging my portrait up here , have you , cousin ralph ? ' said your father , glancing along the walls . ' i 'm glad i do n't see it . it is my whim , cousin ralph , -- and perhaps it is a very silly one , -- but if you have been lately painting my portrait , i want you to destroy it ; at any rate , do n't show it to any one , keep it out of sight . what 's that you have there , cousin ralph ? '
melville	pierre	`` cousin ralph was now more and more fluttered ; not knowing what to make -- as indeed , to this day , i do n't completely myself -- of your father 's strange manner . but he rallied , and said -- 'this , cousin pierre , is a secret portrait i have here ; you must be aware that we portrait-painters are sometimes called upon to paint such . i , therefore , can not show it to you , or tell you any thing about it . '
melville	pierre	`` 'have you been painting my portrait or not , cousin ralph ? ' said your father , very suddenly and pointedly . `` ' i have painted nothing that looks as you there look , ' said cousin ralph , evasively , observing in your father 's face a fierce-like expression , which he had never seen there before . and more than that , your father could not get from him . ''
melville	pierre	`` and what then ? '' said little pierre . `` why not much , my child ; only your father never so much as caught one glimpse of that picture ; indeed , never knew for certain , whether there was such a painting in the world . cousin ralph secretly gave it to me , knowing how tenderly i loved your father ; making me solemnly promise never to expose it anywhere where your father could ever see it , or any way hear of it . this promise i faithfully kept ; and it was only after your dear father 's death , that i hung it in my chamber . there , pierre , you now have the story of the chair-portrait . ''
melville	pierre	`` and a very strange one it is , '' said pierre -- '' and so interesting , i shall never forget it , aunt . '' `` i hope you never will , my child . now ring the bell , and we will have a little fruit-cake , and i will take a glass of wine , pierre ; -- do you hear , my child ? -- the bell -- ring it . why , what do you do standing there , pierre ? ''
melville	pierre	`` _why_ did n't papa want to have cousin ralph paint his picture , aunt ? '' `` how these children 's minds do run ! '' exclaimed old aunt dorothea staring at little pierre in amazement -- '' that indeed is more than i can tell you , little pierre . but cousin ralph had a foolish fancy about it . he used to tell me , that being in your father 's room some few days after the last scene i described , he noticed there a very wonderful work on physiognomy , as they call it , in which the strangest and shadowiest rules were laid down for detecting people 's innermost secrets by studying their faces . and so , foolish cousin ralph always flattered himself , that the reason your father did not want his portrait taken was , because he was secretly in love with the french young lady , and did not want his secret published in a portrait ; since the wonderful work on physiognomy had , as it were , indirectly warned him against running that risk . but cousin ralph being such a retired and solitary sort of a youth , he always had such curious whimsies about things . for my part , i do n't believe your father ever had any such ridiculous ideas on the subject . to be sure , i myself can not tell you _why_ he did not want his picture taken ; but when you get to be as old as i am , little pierre , you will find that every one , even the best of us , at times , is apt to act very queerly and unaccountably ; indeed some things we do , we can not entirely explain the reason of , even to ourselves , little pierre . but you will know all about these strange matters by and by . ''
melville	pierre	`` i hope i shall , aunt , '' said little pierre -- '' but , dear aunt , i thought marten was to bring in some fruit-cake ? '' `` ring the bell for him , then , my child . '' `` oh ! i forgot , '' said little pierre , doing her bidding .
melville	pierre	by-and-by , while the aunt was sipping her wine ; and the boy eating his cake , and both their eyes were fixed on the portrait in question ; little pierre , pushing his stool nearer the picture exclaimed -- '' now , aunt , did papa really look exactly like that ? did you ever see him in that same buff vest , and huge-figured neckcloth ? i remember the seal and key , pretty well ; and it was only a week ago that i saw mamma take them out of a little locked drawer in her wardrobe -- but i do n't remember the queer whiskers ; nor the buff vest ; nor the huge white-figured neckcloth ; did you ever see papa in that very neckcloth , aunt ? ''
melville	pierre	`` my child , it was i that chose the stuff for that neckcloth ; yes , and hemmed it for him , and worked p. g. in one corner ; but that aint in the picture . it is an excellent likeness , my child , neckcloth and all ; as he looked at that time . why , little pierre , sometimes i sit here all alone by myself , gazing , and gazing , and gazing at that face , till i begin to think your father is looking at me , and smiling at me , and nodding at me , and saying -- dorothea ! dorothea ! ''
melville	pierre	`` how strange , '' said little pierre , `` i think it begins to look at me now , aunt . hark ! aunt , it 's so silent all round in this old-fashioned room , that i think i hear a little jingling in the picture , as if the watch-seal was striking against the key -- hark ! aunt . ''
melville	pierre	`` bless me , do n't talk so strangely , my child . '' `` i heard mamma say once -- but she did not say so to me -- that , for her part , she did not like aunt dorothea 's picture ; it was not a good likeness , so she said . why do n't mamma like the picture , aunt ? ''
melville	pierre	`` my child , you ask very queer questions . if your mamma do n't like the picture , it is for a very plain reason . she has a much larger and finer one at home , which she had painted for herself ; yes , and paid i do n't know how many hundred dollars for it ; and that , too , is an excellent likeness , _that_ must be the reason , little pierre . ''
melville	pierre	and thus the old aunt and the little child ran on ; each thinking the other very strange ; and both thinking the picture still stranger ; and the face in the picture still looked at them frankly , and cheerfully , as if there was nothing kept concealed ; and yet again , a little ambiguously and mockingly , as if slyly winking to some other picture , to mark what a very foolish old sister , and what a very silly little son , were growing so monstrously grave and speculative about a huge white-figured neckcloth , a buff vest , and a very gentleman-like and amiable countenance .
melville	pierre	and so , after this scene , as usual , one by one , the fleet years ran on ; till the little child pierre had grown up to be the tall master pierre , and could call the picture his own ; and now , in the privacy of his own little closet , could stand , or lean , or sit before it all day long , if he pleased , and keep thinking , and thinking , and thinking , and thinking , till by-and-by all thoughts were blurred , and at last there were no thoughts at all .
melville	pierre	before the picture was sent to him , in his fifteenth year , it had been only through the inadvertence of his mother , or rather through a casual passing into a parlor by pierre , that he had any way learned that his mother did not approve of the picture . because , as then pierre was still young , and the picture was the picture of his father , and the cherished property of a most excellent , and dearly-beloved , affectionate aunt ; therefore the mother , with an intuitive delicacy , had refrained from knowingly expressing her peculiar opinion in the presence of little pierre . and this judicious , though half-unconscious delicacy in the mother , had been perhaps somewhat singularly answered by a like nicety of sentiment in the child ; for children of a naturally refined organization , and a gentle nurture , sometimes possess a wonderful , and often undreamed of , daintiness of propriety , and thoughtfulness , and forbearance , in matters esteemed a little subtile even by their elders , and self-elected betters . the little pierre never disclosed to his mother that he had , through another person , become aware of her thoughts concerning aunt dorothea 's portrait ; he seemed to possess an intuitive knowledge of the circumstance , that from the difference of their relationship to his father , and for other minute reasons , he could in some things , with the greater propriety , be more inquisitive concerning him , with his aunt , than with his mother , especially touching the matter of the chair-portrait . and aunt dorothea 's reasons accounting for his mother 's distaste , long continued satisfactory , or at least not unsufficiently explanatory .
melville	pierre	and when the portrait arrived at the meadows , it so chanced that his mother was abroad ; and so pierre silently hung it up in his closet ; and when after a day or two his mother returned , he said nothing to her about its arrival , being still strangely alive to that certain mild mystery which invested it , and whose sacredness now he was fearful of violating , by provoking any discussion with his mother about aunt dorothea 's gift , or by permitting himself to be improperly curious concerning the reasons of his mother 's private and self-reserved opinions of it . but the first time -- and it was not long after the arrival of the portrait -- that he knew of his mother 's having entered his closet ; then , when he next saw her , he was prepared to hear what she should voluntarily say about the late addition to its embellishments ; but as she omitted all mention of any thing of that sort , he unobtrusively scanned her countenance , to mark whether any little clouding emotion might be discoverable there . but he could discern none . and as all genuine delicacies are by their nature accumulative ; therefore this reverential , mutual , but only tacit forbearance of the mother and son , ever after continued uninvaded . and it was another sweet , and sanctified , and sanctifying bond between them . for , whatever some lovers may sometimes say , love does not always abhor a secret , as nature is said to abhor a vacuum . love is built upon secrets , as lovely venice upon invisible and incorruptible piles in the sea . love 's secrets , being mysteries , ever pertain to the transcendent and the infinite ; and so they are as airy bridges , by which our further shadows pass over into the regions of the golden mists and exhalations ; whence all poetical , lovely thoughts are engendered , and drop into us , as though pearls should drop from rainbows .
melville	pierre	as time went on , the chasteness and pure virginity of this mutual reservation , only served to dress the portrait in sweeter , because still more mysterious attractions ; and to fling , as it were , fresh fennel and rosemary around the revered memory of the father . though , indeed , as previously recounted , pierre now and then loved to present to himself for some fanciful solution the penultimate secret of the portrait , in so far , as that involved his mother 's distaste ; yet the cunning analysis in which such a mental procedure would involve him , never voluntarily transgressed that sacred limit , where his mother 's peculiar repugnance began to shade off into ambiguous considerations , touching any unknown possibilities in the character and early life of the original . not , that he had altogether forbidden his fancy to range in such fields of speculation ; but all such imaginings must be contributory to that pure , exalted idea of his father , which , in his soul , was based upon the known acknowledged facts of his father 's life .
melville	pierre	v. if , when the mind roams up and down in the ever-elastic regions of evanescent invention , any definite form or feature can be assigned to the multitudinous shapes it creates out of the incessant dissolvings of its own prior creations ; then might we here attempt to hold and define the least shadowy of those reasons , which about the period of adolescence we now treat of , more frequently occurred to pierre , whenever he essayed to account for his mother 's remarkable distaste for the portrait . yet will we venture one sketch .
melville	pierre	yes -- sometimes dimly thought pierre -- who knows but cousin ralph , after all , may have been not so very far from the truth , when he surmised that at one time my father did indeed cherish some passing emotion for the beautiful young frenchwoman . and this portrait being painted at that precise time , and indeed with the precise purpose of perpetuating some shadowy testification of the fact in the countenance of the original : therefore , its expression is not congenial , is not familiar , is not altogether agreeable to my mother : because , not only did my father 's features never look so to her ( since it was afterward that she first became acquainted with him ) , but also , that certain womanliness of women ; that thing i should perhaps call a tender jealousy , a fastidious vanity , in any other lady , enables her to perceive that the glance of the face in the portrait , is not , in some nameless way , dedicated to herself , but to some other and unknown object ; and therefore , is she impatient of it , and it is repelling to her ; for she must naturally be intolerant of any imputed reminiscence in my father , which is not in some way connected with her own recollections of him .
melville	pierre	whereas , the larger and more expansive portrait in the great drawing-room , taken in the prime of life ; during the best and rosiest days of their wedded union ; at the particular desire of my mother ; and by a celebrated artist of her own election , and costumed after her own taste ; and on all hands considered to be , by those who know , a singularly happy likeness at the period ; a belief spiritually reinforced by my own dim infantile remembrances ; for all these reasons , this drawing-room portrait possesses an inestimable charm to her ; there , she indeed beholds her husband as he had really appeared to her ; she does not vacantly gaze upon an unfamiliar phantom called up from the distant , and , to her , well-nigh fabulous days of my father 's bachelor life . but in that other portrait , she sees rehearsed to her fond eyes , the latter tales and legends of his devoted wedded love . yes , i think now that i plainly see it must be so . and yet , ever new conceits come vaporing up in me , as i look on the strange chair-portrait : which , though so very much more unfamiliar to me , than it can possibly be to my mother , still sometimes seems to say -- pierre , believe not the drawing-room painting ; that is not thy father ; or , at least , is not _all_ of thy father . consider in thy mind , pierre , whether we two paintings may not make only one . faithful wives are ever over-fond to a certain imaginary image of their husbands ; and faithful widows are ever over-reverential to a certain imagined ghost of that same imagined image , pierre . look again , i am thy father as he more truly was . in mature life , the world overlays and varnishes us , pierre ; the thousand proprieties and polished finenesses and grimaces intervene , pierre ; then , we , as it were , abdicate ourselves , and take unto us another self , pierre ; in youth we _are_ , pierre , but in age we _seem_ . look again . i am thy real father , so much the more truly , as thou thinkest thou recognizest me not , pierre . to their young children , fathers are not wont to unfold themselves entirely , pierre . there are a thousand and one odd little youthful peccadilloes , that we think we may as well not divulge to them , pierre . consider this strange , ambiguous smile , pierre ; more narrowly regard this mouth . behold , what is this too ardent and , as it were , unchastened light in these eyes , pierre ? i am thy father , boy . there was once a certain , oh , but too lovely young frenchwoman , pierre . youth is hot , and temptation strong , pierre ; and in the minutest moment momentous things are irrevocably done , pierre ; and time sweeps on , and the thing is not always carried down by its stream , but may be left stranded on its bank ; away beyond , in the young , green countries , pierre . look again . doth thy mother dislike me for naught ? consider . do not all her spontaneous , loving impressions , ever strive to magnify , and spiritualize , and deify , her husband 's memory , pierre ? then why doth she cast despite upon me ; and never speak to thee of me ; and why dost thou thyself keep silence before her , pierre ? consider . is there no little mystery here ? probe a little , pierre . never fear , never fear . no matter for thy father now . look , do i not smile ? -- yes , and with an unchangeable smile ; and thus have i unchangeably smiled for many long years gone by , pierre . oh , it is a permanent smile ! thus i smiled to cousin ralph ; and thus in thy dear old aunt dorothea 's parlor , pierre ; and just so , i smile here to thee , and even thus in thy father 's later life , when his body may have been in grief , still -- hidden away in aunt dorothea 's secretary -- i thus smiled as before ; and just so i 'd smile were i now hung up in the deepest dungeon of the spanish inquisition , pierre ; though suspended in outer darkness , still would i smile with this smile , though then not a soul should be near . consider ; for a smile is the chosen vehicle for all ambiguities , pierre . when we would deceive , we smile ; when we are hatching any nice little artifice , pierre ; only just a little gratifying our own sweet little appetites , pierre ; then watch us , and out comes the odd little smile . once upon a time , there was a lovely young frenchwoman , pierre . have you carefully , and analytically , and psychologically , and metaphysically , considered her belongings and surroundings , and all her incidentals , pierre ? oh , a strange sort of story , that , thy dear old aunt dorothea once told thee , pierre . i once knew a credulous old soul , pierre . probe , probe a little -- see -- there seems one little crack there , pierre -- a wedge , a wedge . something ever comes of all persistent inquiry ; we are not so continually curious for nothing , pierre ; not for nothing , do we so intrigue and become wily diplomatists , and glozers with our own minds , pierre ; and afraid of following the indian trail from the open plain into the dark thickets , pierre ; but enough ; a word to the wise .
melville	pierre	thus sometimes in the mystical , outer quietude of the long country nights ; either when the hushed mansion was banked round by the thick-fallen december snows , or banked round by the immovable white august moonlight ; in the haunted repose of a wide story , tenanted only by himself ; and sentineling his own little closet ; and standing guard , as it were , before the mystical tent of the picture ; and ever watching the strangely concealed lights of the meanings that so mysteriously moved to and fro within ; thus sometimes stood pierre before the portrait of his father , unconsciously throwing himself open to all those ineffable hints and ambiguities , and undefined half-suggestions , which now and then people the soul 's atmosphere , as thickly as in a soft , steady snow-storm , the snow-flakes people the air . yet as often starting from these reveries and trances , pierre would regain the assured element of consciously bidden and self-propelled thought ; and then in a moment the air all cleared , not a snow-flake descended , and pierre , upbraiding himself for his self-indulgent infatuation , would promise never again to fall into a midnight revery before the chair-portrait of his father . nor did the streams of these reveries seem to leave any conscious sediment in his mind ; they were so light and so rapid , that they rolled their own alluvial along ; and seemed to leave all pierre 's thought-channels as clean and dry as though never any alluvial stream had rolled there at all .
melville	pierre	and so still in his sober , cherishing memories , his father 's beatification remained untouched ; and all the strangeness of the portrait only served to invest his idea with a fine , legendary romance ; the essence whereof was that very mystery , which at other times was so subtly and evilly significant .
melville	pierre	but now , _now ! _ -- isabel 's letter read : swift as the first light that slides from the sun , pierre saw all preceding ambiguities , all mysteries ripped open as if with a keen sword , and forth trooped thickening phantoms of an infinite gloom . now his remotest infantile reminiscences -- the wandering mind of his father -- the empty hand , and the ashen -- the strange story of aunt dorothea -- the mystical midnight suggestions of the portrait itself ; and , above all , his mother 's intuitive aversion , all , all overwhelmed him with reciprocal testimonies .
melville	pierre	and now , by irresistible intuitions , all that had been inexplicably mysterious to him in the portrait , and all that had been inexplicably familiar in the face , most magically these now coincided ; the merriness of the one not inharmonious with the mournfulness of the other , but by some ineffable correlativeness , they reciprocally identified each other , and , as it were , melted into each other , and thus interpenetratingly uniting , presented lineaments of an added supernaturalness .
melville	pierre	on all sides , the physical world of solid objects now slidingly displaced itself from around him , and he floated into an ether of visions ; and , starting to his feet with clenched hands and outstaring eyes at the transfixed face in the air , he ejaculated that wonderful verse from dante , descriptive of the two mutually absorbing shapes in the inferno :
melville	pierre	`` ah ! how dost thou change , agnello ! see ! thou art not double now , nor only one ! '' book v. misgivings and preparations . i . it was long after midnight when pierre returned to the house . he had rushed forth in that complete abandonment of soul , which , in so ardent a temperament , attends the first stages of any sudden and tremendous affliction ; but now he returned in pallid composure , for the calm spirit of the night , and the then risen moon , and the late revealed stars , had all at last become as a strange subduing melody to him , which , though at first trampled and scorned , yet by degrees had stolen into the windings of his heart , and so shed abroad its own quietude in him . now , from his height of composure , he firmly gazed abroad upon the charred landscape within him ; as the timber man of canada , forced to fly from the conflagration of his forests , comes back again when the fires have waned , and unblinkingly eyes the immeasurable fields of fire-brands that here and there glow beneath the wide canopy of smoke .
melville	pierre	it has been said , that always when pierre would seek solitude in its material shelter and walled isolation , then the closet communicating with his chamber was his elected haunt . so , going to his room , he took up the now dim-burning lamp he had left there , and instinctively entered that retreat , seating himself , with folded arms and bowed head , in the accustomed dragon-footed old chair . with leaden feet , and heart now changing from iciness to a strange sort of indifference , and a numbing sensation stealing over him , he sat there awhile , till , like the resting traveler in snows , he began to struggle against this inertness as the most treacherous and deadliest of symptoms . he looked up , and found himself fronted by the no longer wholly enigmatical , but still ambiguously smiling picture of his father . instantly all his consciousness and his anguish returned , but still without power to shake the grim tranquillity which possessed him . yet endure the smiling portrait he could not ; and obeying an irresistible nameless impulse , he rose , and without unhanging it , reversed the picture on the wall .
melville	pierre	this brought to sight the defaced and dusty back , with some wrinkled , tattered paper over the joints , which had become loosened from the paste . `` oh , symbol of thy reversed idea in my soul , '' groaned pierre ; `` thou shalt not hang thus . rather cast thee utterly out , than conspicuously insult thee so . i will no more have a father . '' he removed the picture wholly from the wall , and the closet ; and concealed it in a large chest , covered with blue chintz , and locked it up there . but still , in a square space of slightly discolored wall , the picture still left its shadowy , but vacant and desolate trace . he now strove to banish the least trace of his altered father , as fearful that at present all thoughts concerning him were not only entirely vain , but would prove fatally distracting and incapacitating to a mind , which was now loudly called upon , not only to endure a signal grief , but immediately to act upon it . wild and cruel case , youth ever thinks ; but mistakenly ; for experience well knows , that action , though it seems an aggravation of woe , is really an alleviative ; though permanently to alleviate pain , we must first dart some added pangs .
melville	pierre	nor now , though profoundly sensible that his whole previous moral being was overturned , and that for him the fair structure of the world must , in some then unknown way , be entirely rebuilded again , from the lowermost corner stone up ; nor now did pierre torment himself with the thought of that last desolation ; and how the desolate place was to be made flourishing again . he seemed to feel that in his deepest soul , lurked an indefinite but potential faith , which could rule in the interregnum of all hereditary beliefs , and circumstantial persuasions ; not wholly , he felt , was his soul in anarchy . the indefinite regent had assumed the scepter as its right ; and pierre was not entirely given up to his grief 's utter pillage and sack .
melville	pierre	to a less enthusiastic heart than pierre 's the foremost question in respect to isabel which would have presented itself , would have been , _what_ must i do ? but such a question never presented itself to pierre ; the spontaneous responsiveness of his being left no shadow of dubiousness as to the direct point he must aim at . but if the object was plain , not so the path to it . _how_ must i do it ? was a problem for which at first there seemed no chance of solution . but without being entirely aware of it himself , pierre was one of those spirits , which not in a determinate and sordid scrutiny of small pros and cons -- but in an impulsive subservience to the god-like dictation of events themselves , find at length the surest solution of perplexities , and the brightest prerogative of command . and as for him , _what_ must i do ? was a question already answered by the inspiration of the difficulty itself ; so now he , as it were , unconsciously discharged his mind , for the present , of all distracting considerations concerning _how_ he should do it ; assured that the coming interview with isabel could not but unerringly inspire him there . still , the inspiration which had thus far directed him had not been entirely mute and undivulging as to many very bitter things which pierre foresaw in the wide sea of trouble into which he was plunged .
melville	pierre	if it be the sacred province and -- by the wisest , deemed -- the inestimable compensation of the heavier woes , that they both purge the soul of gay-hearted errors and replenish it with a saddened truth ; that holy office is not so much accomplished by any covertly inductive reasoning process , whose original motive is received from the particular affliction ; as it is the magical effect of the admission into man 's inmost spirit of a before unexperienced and wholly inexplicable element , which like electricity suddenly received into any sultry atmosphere of the dark , in all directions splits itself into nimble lances of purifying light ; which at one and the same instant discharge all the air of sluggishness and inform it with an illuminating property ; so that objects which before , in the uncertainty of the dark , assumed shadowy and romantic outlines , now are lighted up in their substantial realities ; so that in these flashing revelations of grief 's wonderful fire , we see all things as they are ; and though , when the electric element is gone , the shadows once more descend , and the false outlines of objects again return ; yet not with their former power to deceive ; for now , even in the presence of the falsest aspects , we still retain the impressions of their immovable true ones , though , indeed , once more concealed .
melville	pierre	thus with pierre . in the joyous young times , ere his great grief came upon him , all the objects which surrounded him were concealingly deceptive . not only was the long-cherished image of his rather now transfigured before him from a green foliaged tree into a blasted trunk , but every other image in his mind attested the universality of that electral light which had darted into his soul . not even his lovely , immaculate mother , remained entirely untouched , unaltered by the shock . at her changed aspect , when first revealed to him , pierre had gazed in a panic ; and now , when the electrical storm had gone by , he retained in his mind , that so suddenly revealed image , with an infinite mournfulness . she , who in her less splendid but finer and more spiritual part , had ever seemed to pierre not only as a beautiful saint before whom to offer up his daily orisons , but also as a gentle lady-counsellor and confessor , and her revered chamber as a soft satin-hung cabinet and confessional ; -- his mother was no longer this all-alluring thing ; no more , he too keenly felt , could he go to his mother , as to one who entirely sympathized with him ; as to one before whom he could almost unreservedly unbosom himself ; as to one capable of pointing out to him the true path where he seemed most beset . wonderful , indeed , was that electric insight which fate had now given him into the vital character of his mother . she well might have stood all ordinary tests ; but when pierre thought of the touchstone of his immense strait applied to her spirit , he felt profoundly assured that she would crumble into nothing before it .
melville	pierre	she was a noble creature , but formed chiefly for the gilded prosperities of life , and hitherto mostly used to its unruffled serenities ; bred and expanded , in all developments , under the sole influence of hereditary forms and world-usages . not his refined , courtly , loving , equable mother , pierre felt , could unreservedly , and like a heaven 's heroine , meet the shock of his extraordinary emergency , and applaud , to his heart 's echo , a sublime resolve , whose execution should call down the astonishment and the jeers of the world .
melville	pierre	my mother ! -- dearest mother ! -- god hath given me a sister , and unto thee a daughter , and covered her with the world 's extremest infamy and scorn , that so i and thou -- _thou_ , my mother , mightest gloriously own her , and acknowledge her , and , -- -- nay , nay , groaned pierre , never , never , could such syllables be one instant tolerated by her . then , high-up , and towering , and all-forbidding before pierre grew the before unthought of wonderful edifice of his mother 's immense pride ; -- her pride of birth , her pride of affluence , her pride of purity , and all the pride of high-born , refined , and wealthy life , and all the semiramian pride of woman . then he staggered back upon himself , and only found support in himself . then pierre felt that deep in him lurked a divine unidentifiableness , that owned no earthly kith or kin . yet was this feeling entirely lonesome , and orphan-like . fain , then , for one moment , would he have recalled the thousand sweet illusions of life ; tho ' purchased at the price of life 's truth ; so that once more he might not feel himself driven out an infant ishmael into the desert , with no maternal hagar to accompany and comfort him .
melville	pierre	still , were these emotions without prejudice to his own love for his mother , and without the slightest bitterness respecting her ; and , least of all , there was no shallow disdain toward her of superior virtue . he too plainly saw , that not his mother had made his mother ; but the infinite haughtiness had first fashioned her ; and then the haughty world had further molded her ; nor had a haughty ritual omitted to finish her .
melville	pierre	wonderful , indeed , we repeat it , was the electrical insight which pierre now had into the character of his mother , for not even the vivid recalling of her lavish love for him could suffice to gainsay his sudden persuasion . love me she doth , thought pierre , but how ? loveth she me with the love past all understanding ? that love , which in the loved one 's behalf , would still calmly confront all hate ? whose most triumphing hymn , triumphs only by swelling above all opposing taunts and despite ? -- loving mother , here have i a loved , but world-infamous sister to own ; -- and if thou lovest me , mother , thy love will love her , too , and in the proudest drawing-room take her so much the more proudly by the hand. -- and as pierre thus in fancy led isabel before his mother ; and in fancy led her away , and felt his tongue cleave to the roof of his mouth , with her transfixing look of incredulous , scornful horror ; then pierre 's enthusiastic heart sunk in and in , and caved clean away in him , as he so poignantly felt his first feeling of the dreary heart-vacancies of the conventional life . oh heartless , proud , ice-gilded world , how i hate thee , he thought , that thy tyrannous , insatiate grasp , thus now in my bitterest need -- thus doth rob me even of my mother ; thus doth make me now doubly an orphan , without a green grave to bedew . my tears , -- could i weep them , -- must now be wept in the desolate places ; now to me is it , as though both father and mother had gone on distant voyages , and , returning , died in unknown seas .
melville	pierre	she loveth me , ay ; -- but why ? had i been cast in a cripple 's mold , how then ? now , do i remember that in her most caressing love , there ever gleamed some scaly , glittering folds of pride . me she loveth with pride 's love ; in me she thinks she seeth her own curled and haughty beauty ; before my glass she stands , -- pride 's priestess -- and to her mirrored image , not to me , she offers up her offerings of kisses . oh , small thanks i owe thee , favorable goddess , that didst clothe this form with all the beauty of a man , that so thou mightest hide from me all the truth of a man . now i see that in his beauty a man is snared , and made stone-blind , as the worm within its silk . welcome then be ugliness and poverty and infamy , and all ye other crafty ministers of truth , that beneath the hoods and rags of beggars hide yet the belts and crowns of kings . and dimmed be all beauty that must own the clay ; and dimmed be all wealth , and all delight , and all the annual prosperities of earth , that but gild the links , and stud with diamonds the base rivets and the chains of lies . oh , now methinks i a little see why of old the men _of_ truth went barefoot , girded with a rope , and ever moving under mournfulness as underneath a canopy . i remember now those first wise words , wherewith our savior christ first spoke in his first speech to men : -- 'blessed are the poor in spirit , and blessed they that mourn . ' oh , hitherto i have but piled up words ; bought books , and bought some small experiences , and builded me in libraries ; now i sit down and read . oh , now i know the night , and comprehend the sorceries of the moon , and all the dark persuadings that have their birth in storms and winds . oh , not long will joy abide , when truth doth come ; nor grief her laggard be . well may this head hang on my breast -- it holds too much ; well may my heart knock at my ribs , -- prisoner impatient of his iron bars . oh , men are jailers all ; jailers of themselves ; and in opinion 's world ignorantly hold their noblest part a captive to their vilest ; as disguised royal charles when caught by peasants . the heart ! the heart ! 't is god 's anointed ; let me pursue the heart !
melville	pierre	ii . but if the presentiment in pierre of his mother 's pride , as bigotedly hostile to the noble design he cherished ; if this feeling was so wretched to him ; far more so was the thought of another and a deeper hostility , arising from her more spiritual part . for her pride would not be so scornful , as her wedded memories reject with horror , the unmentionable imputation involved in the mere fact of isabel 's existence . in what galleries of conjecture , among what horrible haunting toads and scorpions , would such a revelation lead her ? when pierre thought of this , the idea of at all divulging his secret to his mother , not only was made repelling by its hopelessness , as an infirm attack upon her citadel of pride , but was made in the last degree inhuman , as torturing her in her tenderest recollections , and desecrating the whitest altar in her sanctuary .
melville	pierre	though the conviction that he must never disclose his secret to his mother was originally an unmeditated , and as it were , an inspired one ; yet now he was almost pains-taking in scrutinizing the entire circumstances of the matter , in order that nothing might be overlooked . for already he vaguely felt , that upon the concealment , or the disclosure of this thing , with reference to his mother , hinged his whole future course of conduct , his whole earthly weal , and isabel 's . but the more and the more that he pondered upon it , the more and the more fixed became his original conviction . he considered that in the case of a disclosure , all human probability pointed to his mother 's scornful rejection of his suit as a pleader for isabel 's honorable admission into the honorable mansion of the glendinnings . then in that case , unconsciously thought pierre , i shall have given the deep poison of a miserable truth to my mother , without benefit to any , and positive harm to all . and through pierre 's mind there then darted a baleful thought ; how that the truth should not always be paraded ; how that sometimes a lie is heavenly , and truth infernal . filially infernal , truly , thought pierre , if i should by one vile breath of truth , blast my father 's blessed memory in the bosom of my mother , and plant the sharpest dagger of grief in her soul . i will not do it !
melville	pierre	but as this resolution in him opened up so dark and wretched a background to his view , he strove to think no more of it now , but postpone it until the interview with isabel should have in some way more definitely shaped his purposes . for , when suddenly encountering the shock of new and unanswerable revelations , which he feels must revolutionize all the circumstances of his life , man , at first , ever seeks to shun all conscious definitiveness in his thoughts and purposes ; as assured , that the lines that shall precisely define his present misery , and thereby lay out his future path ; these can only be defined by sharp stakes that cut into his heart .
melville	pierre	iii . most melancholy of all the hours of earth , is that one long , gray hour , which to the watcher by the lamp intervenes between the night and day ; when both lamp and watcher , over-tasked , grow sickly in the pallid light ; and the watcher , seeking for no gladness in the dawn , sees naught but garish vapors there ; and almost invokes a curse upon the public day , that shall invade his lonely night of sufferance .
melville	pierre	the one small window of his closet looked forth upon the meadow , and across the river , and far away to the distant heights , storied with the great deeds of the glendinnings . many a time had pierre sought this window before sunrise , to behold the blood-red , out-flinging dawn , that would wrap those purple hills as with a banner . but now the morning dawned in mist and rain , and came drizzlingly upon his heart . yet as the day advanced , and once more showed to him the accustomed features of his room by that natural light , which , till this very moment , had never lighted him but to his joy ; now that the day , and not the night , was witness to his woe ; now first the dread reality came appallingly upon him . a sense of horrible forlornness , feebleness , impotence , and infinite , eternal desolation possessed him . it was not merely mental , but corporeal also . he could not stand ; and when he tried to sit , his arms fell floorwards as tied to leaden weights . dragging his ball and chain , he fell upon his bed ; for when the mind is cast down , only in sympathetic proneness can the body rest ; whence the bed is often grief 's first refuge . half stupefied , as with opium , he fell into the profoundest sleep .
melville	pierre	in an hour he awoke , instantly recalling all the previous night ; and now finding himself a little strengthened , and lying so quietly and silently there , almost without bodily consciousness , but his soul unobtrusively alert ; careful not to break the spell by the least movement of a limb , or the least turning of his head . pierre steadfastly faced his grief , and looked deep down into its eyes ; and thoroughly , and calmly , and summarily comprehended it now -- so at least he thought -- and what it demanded from him ; and what he must quickly do in its more immediate sequences ; and what that course of conduct was , which he must pursue in the coming unevadable breakfast interview with his mother ; and what , for the present must be his plan with lucy . his time of thought was brief . rising from his bed , he steadied himself upright a moment ; and then going to his writing-desk , in a few at first faltering , but at length unlagging lines , traced the following note :
melville	pierre	`` i must ask pardon of you , lucy , for so strangely absenting myself last night . but you know me well enough to be very sure that i would not have done so without important cause . i was in the street approaching your cottage , when a message reached me , imperatively calling me away . it is a matter which will take up all my time and attention for , possibly , two or three days . i tell you this , now , that you may be prepared for it . and i know that however unwelcome this may be to you , you will yet bear with it for my sake ; for , indeed , and indeed , lucy dear , i would not dream of staying from you so long , unless irresistibly coerced to it . do not come to the mansion until i come to you ; and do not manifest any curiosity or anxiety about me , should you chance in the interval to see my mother in any other place . keep just as cheerful as if i were by you all the time . do this , now , i conjure you ; and so farewell ! ''
melville	pierre	he folded the note , and was about sealing it , when he hesitated a moment , and instantly unfolding it , read it to himself . but he could not adequately comprehend his own writing , for a sudden cloud came over him . this passed ; and taking his pen hurriedly again , he added the following postscript :
melville	pierre	`` lucy , this note may seem mysterious ; but if it shall , i did not mean to make it so ; nor do i know that i could have helped it . but the only reason is this , lucy : the matter which i have alluded to , is of such a nature , that , for the present i stand virtually pledged not to disclose it to any person but those more directly involved in it . but where one can not reveal the thing itself , it only makes it the more mysterious to write round it this way . so merely know me entirely unmenaced in person , and eternally faithful to you ; and so be at rest till i see you . ''
melville	pierre	then sealing the note , and ringing the bell , he gave it in strict charge to a servant , with directions to deliver it at the earliest practicable moment , and not wait for any answer . but as the messenger was departing the chamber , he called him back , and taking the sealed note again , and hollowing it in his hand , scrawled inside of it in pencil the following words : `` do n't write me ; do n't inquire for me ; '' and then returned it to the man , who quitted him , leaving pierre rooted in thought in the middle of the room .
melville	pierre	but he soon roused himself , and left the mansion ; and seeking the cool , refreshing meadow stream , where it formed a deep and shady pool , he bathed ; and returning invigorated to his chamber , changed his entire dress ; in the little trifling concernments of his toilette , striving utterly to banish all thought of that weight upon his soul . never did he array himself with more solicitude for effect . it was one of his fond mother 's whims to perfume the lighter contents of his wardrobe ; and it was one of his own little femininenesses -- of the sort sometimes curiously observable in very robust-bodied and big-souled men , as mohammed , for example -- to be very partial to all pleasant essences . so that when once more he left the mansion in order to freshen his cheek anew to meet the keen glance of his mother -- to whom the secret of his possible pallor could not be divulged ; pierre went forth all redolent ; but alas ! his body only the embalming cerements of his buried dead within .
melville	pierre	iv . his stroll was longer than he meant ; and when he returned up the linden walk leading to the breakfast-room , and ascended the piazza steps , and glanced into the wide window there , he saw his mother seated not far from the table ; her face turned toward his own ; and heard her gay voice , and peculiarly light and buoyant laugh , accusing him , and not her , of being the morning 's laggard now . dates was busy among some spoons and napkins at a side-stand .
melville	pierre	summoning all possible cheerfulness to his face , pierre entered the room . remembering his carefulness in bathing and dressing ; and knowing that there is no air so calculated to give bloom to the cheek as that of a damply fresh , cool , and misty morning , pierre persuaded himself that small trace would now be found on him of his long night of watching .
melville	pierre	'good morning , sister ; -- such a famous stroll ! i have been all the way to -- -- ' 'where ? good heavens ! where ? for such a look as that ! -- why , pierre , pierre ? what ails thee ? dates , i will touch the bell presently . '
melville	pierre	as the good servitor fumbled for a moment among the napkins , as if unwilling to stir so summarily from his accustomed duty , and not without some of a well and long-tried old domestic 's vague , intermitted murmuring , at being wholly excluded from a matter of family interest ; mrs. glendinning kept her fixed eye on pierre , who , unmindful that the breakfast was not yet entirely ready , seating himself at the table , began helping himself -- though but nervously enough -- to the cream and sugar . the moment the door closed on dates , the mother sprang to her feet , and threw her arms around her son ; but in that embrace , pierre miserably felt that their two hearts beat not together in such unison as before .
melville	pierre	'what haggard thing possesses thee , my son ? speak , this is incomprehensible ! lucy ; -- fie ! -- not she ? -- no love-quarrel there ; -- speak , speak , my darling boy ! 'my dear sister , ' began pierre . 'sister me not , now , pierre ; -- i am thy mother . '
melville	pierre	'well , then , dear mother , thou art quite as incomprehensible to me as i to -- -- ' 'talk faster , pierre -- this calmness freezes me . tell me ; for , by my soul , something most wonderful must have happened to thee . thou art my son , and i command thee . it is not lucy ; it is something else . tell me . '
melville	pierre	'my dear mother , ' said pierre , impulsively moving his chair backward from the table , 'if thou wouldst only believe me when i say it , i have really nothing to tell thee . thou knowest that sometimes , when i happen to feel very foolishly studious and philosophical , i sit up late in my chamber ; and then , regardless of the hour , foolishly run out into the air , for a long stroll across the meadows . i took such a stroll last night ; and had but little time left for napping afterward ; and what nap i had i was none the better for . but i wo n't be so silly again , soon ; so do , dearest mother , stop looking at me , and let us to breakfast. -- dates ! touch the bell there , sister . '
melville	pierre	'stay , pierre ! -- there is a heaviness in this hour . i feel , i know , that thou art deceiving me ; -- perhaps i erred in seeking to wrest thy secret from thee ; but believe me , my son , i never thought thou hadst any secret thing from me , except thy first love for lucy -- and that , my own womanhood tells me , was most pardonable and right . but now , what can it be ? pierre , pierre ! consider well before thou determinest upon withholding confidence from me . i am thy mother . it may prove a fatal thing . can that be good and virtuous , pierre , which shrinks from a mother 's knowledge ? let us not loose hands so , pierre ; thy confidence from me , mine goes from thee . now , shall i touch the bell ? '
melville	pierre	pierre , who had thus far been vainly seeking to occupy his hands with his cap and spoon ; he now paused , and unconsciously fastened a speechless glance of mournfulness upon his mother . again he felt presentiments of his mother 's newly-revealed character . he foresaw the supposed indignation of her wounded pride ; her gradually estranged affections thereupon ; he knew her firmness , and her exaggerated ideas of the inalienable allegiance of a son . he trembled to think , that now indeed was come the first initial moment of his heavy trial . but though he knew all the significance of his mother 's attitude , as she stood before him , intently eying him , with one hand upon the bell-cord ; and though he felt that the same opening of the door that should now admit dates , could not but give eternal exit to all confidence between him and his mother ; and though he felt , too , that this was his mother 's latent thought ; nevertheless , he was girded up in his well-considered resolution .
melville	pierre	`` pierre , pierre ! shall i touch the bell ? '' `` mother , stay ! -- yes do , sister . '' the bell was rung ; and at the summons dates entered ; and looking with some significance at mrs. glendinning , said , -- '' his reverence has come , my mistress , and is now in the west parlor . ''
melville	pierre	`` show mr. falsgrave in here immediately ; and bring up the coffee ; did i not tell you i expected him to breakfast this morning ? '' `` yes , my mistress ; but i thought that -- that -- just then '' -- glancing alarmedly from mother to son .
melville	pierre	`` oh , my good dates , nothing has happened , '' cried mrs. glendinning , lightly , and with a bitter smile , looking toward her son , -- '' show mr. falsgrave in . pierre , i did not see thee , to tell thee , last night ; but mr. falsgrave breakfasts with us by invitation . i was at the parsonage yesterday , to see him about that wretched affair of delly , and we are finally to settle upon what is to be done this morning . but my mind is made up concerning ned ; no such profligate shall pollute this place ; nor shall the disgraceful delly . ''
melville	pierre	fortunately , the abrupt entrance of the clergyman , here turned away attention from the sudden pallor of pierre 's countenance , and afforded him time to rally . `` good morning , madam ; good morning , sir ; '' said mr. falsgrave , in a singularly mild , flute-like voice , turning to mrs. glendinning and her son ; the lady receiving him with answering cordiality , but pierre too embarrassed just then to be equally polite . as for one brief moment mr. falsgrave stood before the pair , ere taking the offered chair from dates , his aspect was eminently attractive .
melville	pierre	there are certain ever-to-be-cherished moments in the life of almost any man , when a variety of little foregoing circumstances all unite to make him temporarily oblivious of whatever may be hard and bitter in his life , and also to make him most amiably and ruddily disposed ; when the scene and company immediately before him are highly agreeable ; and if at such a time he chance involuntarily to put himself into a scenically favorable bodily posture ; then , in that posture , however transient , thou shalt catch the noble stature of his better angel ; catch a heavenly glimpse of the latent heavenliness of man . it was so with mr. falsgrave now . not a house within a circuit of fifty miles that he preferred entering before the mansion-house of saddle meadows ; and though the business upon which he had that morning come , was any thing but relishable to him , yet that subject was not in his memory then . before him stood united in one person , the most exalted lady and the most storied beauty of all the country round ; and the finest , most intellectual , and most congenial youth he knew . before him also , stood the generous foundress and the untiring patroness of the beautiful little marble church , consecrated by the good bishop , not four years gone by . before him also , stood -- though in polite disguise -- the same untiring benefactress , from whose purse , he could not help suspecting , came a great part of his salary , nominally supplied by the rental of the pews . he had been invited to breakfast ; a meal , which , in a well-appointed country family , is the most cheerful circumstance of daily life ; he smelt all java 's spices in the aroma from the silver coffee-urn ; and well he knew , what liquid deliciousness would soon come from it . besides all this , and many more minutenesses of the kind , he was conscious that mrs. glendinning entertained a particular partiality for him ( though not enough to marry him , as he ten times knew by very bitter experience ) , and that pierre was not behindhand in his esteem .
melville	pierre	and the clergyman was well worthy of it . nature had been royally bountiful to him in his person . in his happier moments , as the present , his face was radiant with a courtly , but mild benevolence ; his person was nobly robust and dignified ; while the remarkable smallness of his feet , and the almost infantile delicacy , and vivid whiteness and purity of his hands , strikingly contrasted with his fine girth and stature . for in countries like america , where there is no distinct hereditary caste of gentlemen , whose order is factitiously perpetuated as race-horses and lords are in kingly lands ; and especially , in those agricultural districts , where , of a hundred hands , that drop a ballot for the presidency , ninety-nine shall be of the brownest and the brawniest ; in such districts , this daintiness of the fingers , when united with a generally manly aspect , assumes a remarkableness unknown in european nations .
melville	pierre	this most prepossessing form of the clergyman lost nothing by the character of his manners , which were polished and unobtrusive , but peculiarly insinuating , without the least appearance of craftiness or affectation . heaven had given him his fine , silver-keyed person for a flute to play on in this world ; and he was nearly the perfect master of it . his graceful motions had the undulatoriness of melodious sounds . you almost thought you heard , not saw him . so much the wonderful , yet natural gentleman he seemed , that more than once mrs. glendinning had held him up to pierre as a splendid example of the polishing and gentlemanizing influences of christianity upon the mind and manners ; declaring , that extravagant as it might seem , she had always been of his father 's fancy , -- that no man could be a complete gentleman , and preside with dignity at his own table , unless he partook of the church 's sacraments . nor in mr. falsgrave 's case was this maxim entirely absurd . the child of a poor northern farmer who had wedded a pretty sempstress , the clergyman had no heraldic line of ancestry to show , as warrant and explanation of his handsome person and gentle manners ; the first , being the willful partiality of nature ; and the second , the consequence of a scholastic life , attempered by a taste for the choicest female society , however small , which he had always regarded as the best relish of existence . if now his manners thus responded to his person , his mind answered to them both , and was their finest illustration . besides his eloquent persuasiveness in the pulpit , various fugitive papers upon subjects of nature , art , and literature , attested not only his refined affinity to all beautiful things , visible or invisible ; but likewise that he possessed a genius for celebrating such things , which in a less indolent and more ambitious nature , would have been sure to have gained a fair poet 's name ere now . for this mr. falsgrave was just hovering upon his prime of years ; a period which , in such a man , is the sweetest , and , to a mature woman , by far the most attractive of manly life . youth has not yet completely gone with its beauty , grace , and strength ; nor has age at all come with its decrepitudes ; though the finest undrossed parts of it -- its mildness and its wisdom -- have gone on before , as decorous chamberlains precede the sedan of some crutched king .
melville	pierre	such was this mr. falsgrave , who now sat at mrs. glendinning 's breakfast table , a corner of one of that lady 's generous napkins so inserted into his snowy bosom , that its folds almost invested him as far down as the table 's edge ; and he seemed a sacred priest , indeed , breakfasting in his surplice .
melville	pierre	`` pray , mr. falsgrave , '' said mrs. glendinning , `` break me off a bit of that roll . '' whether or not his sacerdotal experiences had strangely refined and spiritualized so simple a process as breaking bread ; or whether it was from the spotless aspect of his hands : certain it is that mr. falsgrave acquitted himself on this little occasion , in a manner that beheld of old by leonardo , might have given that artist no despicable hint touching his celestial painting . as pierre regarded him , sitting there so mild and meek ; such an image of white-browed and white-handed , and napkined immaculateness ; and as he felt the gentle humane radiations which came from the clergyman 's manly and rounded beautifulness ; and as he remembered all the good that he knew of this man , and all the good that he had heard of him , and could recall no blemish in his character ; and as in his own concealed misery and forlornness , he contemplated the open benevolence , and beaming excellent-heartedness of mr. falsgrave , the thought darted through his mind , that if any living being was capable of giving him worthy counsel in his strait ; and if to any one he could go with christian propriety and some small hopefulness , that person was the one before him .
melville	pierre	`` pray , mr. glendinning , '' said the clergyman , pleasantly , as pierre was silently offering to help him to some tongue -- '' do n't let me rob you of it -- pardon me , but you seem to have very little yourself this morning , i think . an execrable pun , i know : but '' -- turning toward mrs. glendinning -- '' when one is made to feel very happy , one is somehow apt to say very silly things . happiness and silliness -- ah , it 's a suspicious coincidence . ''
melville	pierre	`` mr. falsgrave , '' said the hostess -- '' your cup is empty . dates ! -- we were talking yesterday , mr. falsgrave , concerning that vile fellow , ned . '' `` well , madam , '' responded the gentleman , a very little uneasily . `` he shall not stay on any ground of mine ; my mind is made up , sir . infamous man ! -- did he not have a wife as virtuous and beautiful now , as when i first gave her away at your altar ? -- it was the sheerest and most gratuitous profligacy . ''
melville	pierre	the clergyman mournfully and assentingly moved his head . `` such men , '' continued the lady , flushing with the sincerest indignation -- '' are to my way of thinking more detestable than murderers . '' `` that is being a little hard upon them , my dear madam , '' said mr. falsgrave , mildly .
melville	pierre	`` do you not think so , pierre '' -- now , said the lady , turning earnestly upon her son -- '' is not the man , who has sinned like that ned , worse than a murderer ? has he not sacrificed one woman completely , and given infamy to another -- to both of them -- for their portion . if his own legitimate boy should now hate him , i could hardly blame him . ''
melville	pierre	`` my dear madam , '' said the clergyman , whose eyes having followed mrs. glendinning 's to her son 's countenance , and marking a strange trepidation there , had thus far been earnestly scrutinizing pierre 's not wholly repressible emotion ; -- '' my dear madam , '' he said , slightly bending over his stately episcopal-looking person -- '' virtue has , perhaps , an over-ardent champion in you ; you grow too warm ; but mr. glendinning , here , he seems to grow too cold . pray , favor us with your views , mr . glendinning ? ''
melville	pierre	`` i will not think now of the man , '' said pierre , slowly , and looking away from both his auditors -- '' let us speak of delly and her infant -- she has , or had one , i have loosely heard ; -- their case is miserable indeed . ''
melville	pierre	`` the mother deserves it , '' said the lady , inflexibly -- '' and the child -- reverend sir , what are the words of the bible ? '' `` 'the sins of the father shall be visited upon the children to the third generation , ' '' said mr. falsgrave , with some slight reluctance in his tones . `` but madam , that does not mean , that the community is in any way to take the infamy of the children into their own voluntary hands , as the conscious delegated stewards of god 's inscrutable dispensations . because it is declared that the infamous consequences of sin shall be hereditary , it does not follow that our personal and active loathing of sin , should descend from the sinful sinner to his sinless child . ''
melville	pierre	`` i understand you , sir , '' said mrs. glendinning , coloring slightly , `` you think me too censorious . but if we entirely forget the parentage of the child , and every way receive the child as we would any other , feel for it in all respects the same , and attach no sign of ignominy to it -- how then is the bible dispensation to be fulfilled ? do we not then put ourselves in the way of its fulfilment , and is that wholly free from impiety ? ''
melville	pierre	here it was the clergyman 's turn to color a little , and there was a just perceptible tremor of the under lip . `` pardon me , '' continued the lady , courteously , `` but if there is any one blemish in the character of the reverend mr. falsgrave , it is that the benevolence of his heart , too much warps in him the holy rigor of our church 's doctrines . for my part , as i loathe the man , i loathe the woman , and never desire to behold the child . ''
melville	pierre	a pause ensued , during which it was fortunate for pierre , that by the social sorcery of such occasions as the present , the eyes of all three were intent upon the cloth ; all three for the moment , giving loose to their own distressful meditations upon the subject in debate , and mr. falsgrave vexedly thinking that the scene was becoming a little embarrassing .
melville	pierre	pierre was the first who spoke ; as before , he steadfastly kept his eyes away from both his auditors ; but though he did not designate his mother , something in the tone of his voice showed that what he said was addressed more particularly to her .
melville	pierre	`` since we seem to have been strangely drawn into the ethical aspect of this melancholy matter , '' said he , `` suppose we go further in it ; and let me ask , how it should be between the legitimate and the illegitimate child -- children of one father -- when they shall have passed their childhood ? ''
melville	pierre	here the clergyman quickly raising his eyes , looked as surprised and searchingly at pierre , as his politeness would permit . `` upon my word '' -- said mrs. glendinning , hardly less surprised , and making no attempt at disguising it -- '' this is an odd question you put ; you have been more attentive to the subject than i had fancied . but what do you mean , pierre ? i did not entirely understand you . ''
melville	pierre	`` should the legitimate child shun the illegitimate , when one father is father to both ? '' rejoined pierre , bending his head still further over his plate . the clergyman looked a little down again , and was silent ; but still turned his head slightly sideways toward his hostess , as if awaiting some reply to pierre from her .
melville	pierre	`` ask the world , pierre '' -- said mrs. glendinning warmly -- '' and ask your own heart . '' `` my own heart ? i will , madam '' -- said pierre , now looking up steadfastly ; `` but what do _you_ think , mr . falsgrave ? '' letting his glance drop again -- '' should the one shun the other ; should the one refuse his highest sympathy and perfect love for the other , especially if that other be deserted by all the rest of the world ? what think you would have been our blessed savior 's thoughts on such a matter ? and what was that he so mildly said to the adulteress ? ''
melville	pierre	a swift color passed over the clergyman 's countenance , suffusing even his expanded brow ; he slightly moved in his chair , and looked uncertainly from pierre to his mother . he seemed as a shrewd , benevolent-minded man , placed between opposite opinions -- merely opinions -- who , with a full , and doubly-differing persuasion in himself , still refrains from uttering it , because of an irresistible dislike to manifesting an absolute dissent from the honest convictions of any person , whom he both socially and morally esteems .
melville	pierre	`` well , what do you reply to my son ? '' -- said mrs. glendinning at last . `` madam and sir '' -- said the clergyman , now regaining his entire self-possession . `` it is one of the social disadvantages which we of the pulpit labor under , that we are supposed to know more of the moral obligations of humanity than other people . and it is a still more serious disadvantage to the world , that our unconsidered , conversational opinions on the most complex problems of ethics , are too apt to be considered authoritative , as indirectly proceeding from the church itself . now , nothing can be more erroneous than such notions ; and nothing so embarrasses me , and deprives me of that entire serenity , which is indispensable to the delivery of a careful opinion on moral subjects , than when sudden questions of this sort are put to me in company . pardon this long preamble , for i have little more to say . it is not every question , however direct , mr. glendinning , which can be conscientiously answered with a yes or no . millions of circumstances modify all moral questions ; so that though conscience may possibly dictate freely in any known special case ; yet , by one universal maxim , to embrace all moral contingencies , -- this is not only impossible , but the attempt , to me , seems foolish . ''
melville	pierre	at this instant , the surplice-like napkin dropped from the clergyman 's bosom , showing a minute but exquisitely cut cameo brooch , representing the allegorical union of the serpent and dove . it had been the gift of an appreciative friend , and was sometimes worn on secular occasions like the present .
melville	pierre	`` i agree with you , sir '' -- said pierre , bowing . `` i fully agree with you . and now , madam , let us talk of something else . '' `` you madam me very punctiliously this morning , mr. glendinning '' -- said his mother , half-bitterly smiling , and half-openly offended , but still more surprised at pierre 's frigid demeanor .
melville	pierre	`` 'honor thy father and mother ; ' '' said pierre -- '' _both_ father and mother , '' he unconsciously added . `` and now that it strikes me , mr. falsgrave , and now that we have become so strangely polemical this morning , let me say , that as that command is justly said to be the only one with a promise , so it seems to be without any contingency in the application . it would seem -- would it not , sir ? -- that the most deceitful and hypocritical of fathers should be equally honored by the son , as the purest . ''
melville	pierre	`` so it would certainly seem , according to the strict letter of the decalogue -- certainly . '' `` and do you think , sir , that it should be so held , and so applied in actual life ? for instance , should i honor my father , if i knew him to be a seducer ? ''
melville	pierre	`` pierre ! pierre ! '' said his mother , profoundly coloring , and half rising ; `` there is no need of these argumentative assumptions . you very immensely forget yourself this morning . '' `` it is merely the interest of the general question , madam , '' returned pierre , coldly . `` i am sorry . if your former objection does not apply here , mr. falsgrave , will you favor me with an answer to my question ? ''
melville	pierre	`` there you are again , mr. glendinning , '' said the clergyman , thankful for pierre 's hint ; `` that is another question in morals absolutely incapable of a definite answer , which shall be universally applicable . '' again the surplice-like napkin chanced to drop .
melville	pierre	`` i am tacitly rebuked again then , sir , '' said pierre , slowly ; `` but i admit that perhaps you are again in the right . and now , madam , since mr. falsgrave and yourself have a little business together , to which my presence is not necessary , and may possibly prove quite dispensable , permit me to leave you . i am going off on a long ramble , so you need not wait dinner for me . good morning , mr. falsgrave ; good morning , madam , '' looking toward his mother .
melville	pierre	as the door closed upon him , mr. falsgrave spoke -- '' mr. glendinning looks a little pale to-day : has he been ill ? '' `` not that i know of , '' answered the lady , indifferently , `` but did you ever see young gentleman so stately as he was ! extraordinary ! '' she murmured ; `` what can this mean -- madam -- madam ? but your cup is empty again , sir '' -- reaching forth her hand .
melville	pierre	`` no more , no more , madam , '' said the clergyman . `` madam ? pray do n't madam me any more , mr. falsgrave ; i have taken a sudden hatred to that title . '' `` shall it be your majesty , then ? '' said the clergyman , gallantly ; `` the may queens are so styled , and so should be the queens of october . ''
melville	pierre	here the lady laughed . `` come , '' said she , `` let us go into another room , and settle the affair of that infamous ned and that miserable delly . '' v. the swiftness and unrepellableness of the billow which , with its first shock , had so profoundly whelmed pierre , had not only poured into his soul a tumult of entirely new images and emotions , but , for the time , it almost entirely drove out of him all previous ones . the things that any way bore directly upon the pregnant fact of isabel , these things were all animate and vividly present to him ; but the things which bore more upon himself , and his own personal condition , as now forever involved with his sister 's , these things were not so animate and present to him . the conjectured past of isabel took mysterious hold of his father ; therefore , the idea of his father tyrannized over his imagination ; and the possible future of isabel , as so essentially though indirectly compromisable by whatever course of conduct his mother might hereafter ignorantly pursue with regard to himself , as henceforth , through isabel , forever altered to her ; these considerations brought his mother with blazing prominence before him .
melville	pierre	heaven , after all , hath been a little merciful to the miserable man ; not entirely untempered to human nature are the most direful blasts of fate . when on all sides assailed by prospects of disaster , whose final ends are in terror hidden from it , the soul of man -- either , as instinctively convinced that it can not battle with the whole host at once ; or else , benevolently blinded to the larger arc of the circle which menacingly hems it in ; -- whichever be the truth , the soul of man , thus surrounded , can not , and does never intelligently confront the totality of its wretchedness . the bitter drug is divided into separate draughts for him : to-day he takes one part of his woe ; to-morrow he takes more ; and so on , till the last drop is drunk .
melville	pierre	not that in the despotism of other things , the thought of lucy , and the unconjecturable suffering into which she might so soon be plunged , owing to the threatening uncertainty of the state of his own future , as now in great part and at all hazards dedicated to isabel ; not that this thought had thus far been alien to him . icy-cold , and serpent-like , it had overlayingly crawled in upon his other shuddering imaginings ; but those other thoughts would as often upheave again , and absorb it into themselves , so that it would in that way soon disappear from his cotemporary apprehension . the prevailing thoughts connected with isabel he now could front with prepared and open eyes ; but the occasional thought of lucy , when _that_ started up before him , he could only cover his bewildered eyes with his bewildered hands . nor was this the cowardice of selfishness , but the infinite sensitiveness of his soul . he could bear the agonizing thought of isabel , because he was immediately resolved to help her , and to assuage a fellow-being 's grief ; but , as yet , he could not bear the thought of lucy , because the very resolution that promised balm to isabel obscurely involved the everlasting peace of lucy , and therefore aggravatingly threatened a far more than fellow-being 's happiness .
melville	pierre	well for pierre it was , that the penciling presentiments of his mind concerning lucy as quickly erased as painted their tormenting images . standing half-befogged upon the mountain of his fate , all that part of the wide panorama was wrapped in clouds to him ; but anon those concealings slid aside , or rather , a quick rent was made in them ; disclosing far below , half-vailed in the lower mist , the winding tranquil vale and stream of lucy 's previous happy life ; through the swift cloud-rent he caught one glimpse of her expectant and angelic face peeping from the honey-suckled window of her cottage ; and the next instant the stormy pinions of the clouds locked themselves over it again ; and all was hidden as before ; and all went confused in whirling rack and vapor as before . only by unconscious inspiration , caught from the agencies invisible to man , had he been enabled to write that first obscurely announcing note to lucy ; wherein the collectedness , and the mildness , and the calmness , were but the natural though insidious precursors of the stunning bolts on bolts to follow .
melville	pierre	but , while thus , for the most part wrapped from his consciousness and vision , still , the condition of his lucy , as so deeply affected now , was still more and more disentangling and defining itself from out its nearer mist , and even beneath the general upper fog . for when unfathomably stirred , the subtler elements of man do not always reveal themselves in the concocting act ; but , as with all other potencies , show themselves chiefly in their ultimate resolvings and results . strange wild work , and awfully symmetrical and reciprocal , was that now going on within the self-apparently chaotic breast of pierre . as in his own conscious determinations , the mournful isabel was being snatched from her captivity of world-wide abandonment ; so , deeper down in the more secret chambers of his unsuspecting soul , the smiling lucy , now as dead and ashy pale , was being bound a ransom for isabel 's salvation . eye for eye , and tooth for tooth . eternally inexorable and unconcerned is fate , a mere heartless trader in men 's joys and woes .
melville	pierre	nor was this general and spontaneous self-concealment of all the most momentous interests of his love , as irretrievably involved with isabel and his resolution respecting her ; nor was this unbidden thing in him unseconded by the prompting of his own conscious judgment , when in the tyranny of the master-event itself , that judgment was permitted some infrequent play . he could not but be aware , that all meditation on lucy now was worse than useless . how could he now map out his and her young life-chart , when all was yet misty-white with creamy breakers ! still more : divinely dedicated as he felt himself to be ; with divine commands upon him to befriend and champion isabel , through all conceivable contingencies of time and chance ; how could he insure himself against the insidious inroads of self-interest , and hold intact all his unselfish magnanimities , if once he should permit the distracting thought of lucy to dispute with isabel 's the pervading possession of his soul ?
melville	pierre	and if -- though but unconsciously as yet -- he was almost superhumanly prepared to make a sacrifice of all objects dearest to him , and cut himself away from his last hopes of common happiness , should they cross his grand enthusiast resolution ; -- if this was so with him ; then , how light as gossamer , and thinner and more impalpable than airiest threads of gauze , did he hold all common conventional regardings ; -- his hereditary duty to his mother , his pledged worldly faith and honor to the hand and seal of his affiancement ?
melville	pierre	not that at present all these things did thus present themselves to pierre ; but these things were foetally forming in him . impregnations from high enthusiasms he had received ; and the now incipient offspring which so stirred , with such painful , vague vibrations in his soul ; this , in its mature development , when it should at last come forth in living deeds , would scorn all personal relationship with pierre , and hold his heart 's dearest interests for naught .
melville	pierre	thus , in the enthusiast to duty , the heaven-begotten christ is born ; and will not own a mortal parent , and spurns and rends all mortal bonds . vi . one night , one day , and a small part of the one ensuing evening had been given to pierre to prepare for the momentous interview with isabel .
melville	pierre	now , thank god , thought pierre , the night is past , -- the night of chaos and of doom ; the day only , and the skirt of evening now remain . may heaven new-string my soul , and confirm me in the christ-like feeling i first felt . may i , in all my least shapeful thoughts still square myself by the inflexible rule of holy right . let no unmanly , mean temptation cross my path this day ; let no base stone lie in it . this day i will forsake the censuses of men , and seek the suffrages of the god-like population of the trees , which now seem to me a nobler race than man . their high foliage shall drop heavenliness upon me ; my feet in contact with their mighty roots , immortal vigor shall so steal into me . guide me , gird me , guard me , this day , ye sovereign powers ! bind me in bonds i can not break ; remove all sinister allurings from me ; eternally this day deface in me the detested and distorted images of all the convenient lies and duty-subterfuges of the diving and ducking moralities of this earth . fill me with consuming fire for them ; to my life 's muzzle , cram me with your own intent . let no world-syren come to sing to me this day , and wheedle from me my undauntedness . i cast my eternal die this day , ye powers . on my strong faith in ye invisibles , i stake three whole felicities , and three whole lives this day . if ye forsake me now , -- farewell to faith , farewell to truth , farewell to god ; exiled for aye from god and man , i shall declare myself an equal power with both ; free to make war on night and day , and all thoughts and things of mind and matter , which the upper and the nether firmaments do clasp !
melville	pierre	vii . but pierre , though , charged with the fire of all divineness , his containing thing was made of clay . ah , muskets the gods have made to carry infinite combustions , and yet made them of clay !
melville	pierre	save me from being bound to truth , liege lord , as i am now . how shall i steal yet further into pierre , and show how this heavenly fire was helped to be contained in him , by mere contingent things , and things that he knew not . but i shall follow the endless , winding way , -- the flowing river in the cave of man ; careless whither i be led , reckless where i land .
melville	pierre	was not the face -- though mutely mournful -- beautiful , bewitchingly ? how unfathomable those most wondrous eyes of supernatural light ! in those charmed depths , grief and beauty plunged and dived together . so beautiful , so mystical , so bewilderingly alluring ; speaking of a mournfulness infinitely sweeter and more attractive than all mirthfulness ; that face of glorious suffering ; that face of touching loveliness ; that face was pierre 's own sister 's ; that face was isabel 's ; that face pierre had visibly seen ; into those same supernatural eyes our pierre had looked . thus , already , and ere the proposed encounter , he was assured that , in a transcendent degree , womanly beauty , and not womanly ugliness , invited him to champion the right . be naught concealed in this book of sacred truth . how , if accosted in some squalid lane , a humped , and crippled , hideous girl should have snatched his garment 's hem , with -- '' save me , pierre -- love me , own me , brother ; i am thy sister ! '' -- ah , if man were wholly made in heaven , why catch we hell-glimpses ? why in the noblest marble pillar that stands beneath the all-comprising vault , ever should we descry the sinister vein ? we lie in nature very close to god ; and though , further on , the stream may be corrupted by the banks it flows through ; yet at the fountain 's rim , where mankind stand , there the stream infallibly bespeaks the fountain .
melville	pierre	so let no censorious word be here hinted of mortal pierre . easy for me to slyly hide these things , and always put him before the eye as perfect as immaculate ; unsusceptible to the inevitable nature and the lot of common men . i am more frank with pierre than the best men are with themselves . i am all unguarded and magnanimous with pierre ; therefore you see his weakness , and therefore only . in reserves men build imposing characters ; not in revelations . he who shall be wholly honest , though nobler than ethan allen ; that man shall stand in danger of the meanest mortal 's scorn .
melville	pierre	book vi . isabel , and the first part of the story of isabel . i . half wishful that the hour would come ; half shuddering that every moment it still came nearer and more near to him ; dry-eyed , but wet with that dark day 's rain ; at fall of eve , pierre emerged from long wanderings in the primeval woods of saddle meadows , and for one instant stood motionless upon their sloping skirt .
melville	pierre	where he stood was in the rude wood road , only used by sledges in the time of snow ; just where the out-posted trees formed a narrow arch , and fancied gateway leading upon the far , wide pastures sweeping down toward the lake . in that wet and misty eve the scattered , shivering pasture elms seemed standing in a world inhospitable , yet rooted by inscrutable sense of duty to their place . beyond , the lake lay in one sheet of blankness and of dumbness , unstirred by breeze or breath ; fast bound there it lay , with not life enough to reflect the smallest shrub or twig . yet in that lake was seen the duplicate , stirless sky above . only in sunshine did that lake catch gay , green images ; and these but displaced the imaged muteness of the unfeatured heavens .
melville	pierre	on both sides , in the remoter distance , and also far beyond the mild lake 's further shore , rose the long , mysterious mountain masses ; shaggy with pines and hemlocks , mystical with nameless , vapory exhalations , and in that dim air black with dread and gloom . at their base , profoundest forests lay entranced , and from their far owl-haunted depths of caves and rotted leaves , and unused and unregarded inland overgrowth of decaying wood -- for smallest sticks of which , in other climes many a pauper was that moment perishing ; from out the infinite inhumanities of those profoundest forests , came a moaning , muttering , roaring , intermitted , changeful sound : rain-shakings of the palsied trees , slidings of rocks undermined , final crashings of long-riven boughs , and devilish gibberish of the forest-ghosts .
melville	pierre	but more near , on the mild lake 's hither shore , where it formed a long semi-circular and scooped acclivity of corn-fields , there the small and low red farm-house lay ; its ancient roof a bed of brightest mosses ; its north front ( from the north the moss-wind blows ) , also moss-incrusted , like the north side of any vast-trunked maple in the groves . at one gabled end , a tangled arbor claimed support , and paid for it by generous gratuities of broad-flung verdure , one viny shaft of which pointed itself upright against the chimney-bricks , as if a waving lightning-rod . against the other gable , you saw the lowly dairy-shed ; its sides close netted with traced madeira vines ; and had you been close enough , peeping through that imprisoning tracery , and through the light slats barring the little embrasure of a window , you might have seen the gentle and contented captives -- the pans of milk , and the snow-white dutch cheeses in a row , and the molds of golden butter , and the jars of lily cream . in front , three straight gigantic lindens stood guardians of this verdant spot . a long way up , almost to the ridge-pole of the house , they showed little foliage ; but then , suddenly , as three huge green balloons , they poised their three vast , inverted , rounded cones of verdure in the air .
melville	pierre	soon as pierre 's eye rested on the place , a tremor shook him . not alone because of isabel , as there a harborer now , but because of two dependent and most strange coincidences which that day 's experience had brought to him . he had gone to breakfast with his mother , his heart charged to overflowing with presentiments of what would probably be her haughty disposition concerning such a being as isabel , claiming her maternal love : and lo ! the reverend mr. falsgrave enters , and ned and delly are discussed , and that whole sympathetic matter , which pierre had despaired of bringing before his mother in all its ethic bearings , so as absolutely to learn her thoughts upon it , and thereby test his own conjectures ; all that matter had been fully talked about ; so that , through that strange coincidence , he now perfectly knew his mother 's mind , and had received forewarnings , as if from heaven , not to make any present disclosure to her . that was in the morning ; and now , at eve catching a glimpse of the house where isabel was harboring , at once he recognized it as the rented farm-house of old walter ulver , father to the self-same delly , forever ruined through the cruel arts of ned .
melville	pierre	strangest feelings , almost supernatural , now stole into pierre . with little power to touch with awe the souls of less susceptible , reflective , and poetic beings , such coincidences , however frequently they may recur , ever fill the finer organization with sensations which transcend all verbal renderings . they take hold of life 's subtlest problem . with the lightning 's flash , the query is spontaneously propounded -- chance , or god ? if too , the mind thus influenced be likewise a prey to any settled grief , then on all sides the query magnifies , and at last takes in the all-comprehending round of things . for ever is it seen , that sincere souls in suffering , then most ponder upon final causes . the heart , stirred to its depths , finds correlative sympathy in the head , which likewise is profoundly moved . before miserable men , when intellectual , all the ages of the world pass as in a manacled procession , and all their myriad links rattle in the mournful mystery .
melville	pierre	pacing beneath the long-skirting shadows of the elevated wood , waiting for the appointed hour to come , pierre strangely strove to imagine to himself the scene which was destined to ensue . but imagination utterly failed him here ; the reality was too real for him ; only the face , the face alone now visited him ; and so accustomed had he been of late to confound it with the shapes of air , that he almost trembled when he thought that face to face , that face must shortly meet his own .
melville	pierre	and now the thicker shadows begin to fall ; the place is lost to him ; only the three dim , tall lindens pilot him as he descends the hill , hovering upon the house . he knows it not , but his meditative route is sinuous ; as if that moment his thought 's stream was likewise serpentining : laterally obstructed by insinuated misgivings as to the ultimate utilitarian advisability of the enthusiast resolution that was his . his steps decrease in quickness as he comes more nigh , and sees one feeble light struggling in the rustic double-casement . infallibly he knows that his own voluntary steps are taking him forever from the brilliant chandeliers of the mansion of saddle meadows , to join company with the wretched rush-lights of poverty and woe . but his sublime intuitiveness also paints to him the sun-like glories of god-like truth and virtue ; which though ever obscured by the dense fogs of earth , still shall shine eventually in unclouded radiance , casting illustrative light upon the sapphire throne of god .
melville	pierre	ii . he stands before the door ; the house is steeped in silence ; he knocks ; the casement light flickers for a moment , and then moves away ; within , he hears a door creak on its hinges ; then his whole heart beats wildly as the outer latch is lifted ; and holding the light above her supernatural head , isabel stands before him . it is herself . no word is spoken ; no other soul is seen . they enter the room of the double casement ; and pierre sits down , overpowered with bodily faintness and spiritual awe . he lifts his eyes to isabel 's gaze of loveliness and loneliness ; and then a low , sweet , half-sobbing voice of more than natural musicalness is heard : --
melville	pierre	`` and so , thou art my brother ; -- shall i call thee pierre ? '' steadfastly , with his one first and last fraternal inquisition of the person of the mystic girl , pierre now for an instant eyes her ; and in that one instant sees in the imploring face , not only the nameless touchingness of that of the sewing-girl , but also the subtler expression of the portrait of his then youthful father , strangely translated , and intermarryingly blended with some before unknown , foreign feminineness . in one breath , memory and prophecy , and intuition tell him -- '' pierre , have no reserves ; no minutest possible doubt ; -- this being is thy sister ; thou gazest on thy father 's flesh . ''
melville	pierre	`` and so thou art my brother ! -- shall i call thee pierre ? '' he sprang to his feet , and caught her in his undoubting arms . `` thou art ! thou art ! '' he felt a faint struggling within his clasp ; her head drooped against him ; his whole form was bathed in the flowing glossiness of her long and unimprisoned hair . brushing the locks aside , he now gazed upon the death-like beauty of the face , and caught immortal sadness from it . she seemed as dead ; as suffocated , -- the death that leaves most unimpaired the latent tranquillities and sweetnesses of the human countenance .
melville	pierre	he would have called aloud for succor ; but the slow eyes opened upon him ; and slowly he felt the girl 's supineness leaving her ; and now she recovers herself a little , -- and again he feels her faintly struggling in his arms , as if somehow abashed , and incredulous of mortal right to hold her so . now pierre repents his over-ardent and incautious warmth , and feels himself all reverence for her . tenderly he leads her to a bench within the double casement ; and sits beside her ; and waits in silence , till the first shock of this encounter shall have left her more composed and more prepared to hold communion with him .
melville	pierre	`` how feel'st thou now , my sister ? '' `` bless thee ! bless thee ! '' again the sweet , wild power of the musicalness of the voice , and some soft , strange touch of foreignness in the accent , -- so it fancifully seemed to pierre , thrills through and through his soul . he bent and kissed her brow ; and then feels her hand seeking his , and then clasping it without one uttered word .
melville	pierre	all his being is now condensed in that one sensation of the clasping hand . he feels it as very small and smooth , but strangely hard . then he knew that by the lonely labor of her hands , his own father 's daughter had earned her living in the same world , where he himself , her own brother , had so idly dwelled . once more he reverently kissed her brow , and his warm breath against it murmured with a prayer to heaven .
melville	pierre	`` i have no tongue to speak to thee , pierre , my brother . my whole being , all my life 's thoughts and longings are in endless arrears to thee ; then how can i speak to thee ? were it god 's will , pierre , my utmost blessing now , were to lie down and die . then should i be at peace . bear with me , pierre . ''
melville	pierre	`` eternally will i do that , my beloved isabel ! speak not to me yet awhile , if that seemeth best to thee , if that only is possible to thee . this thy clasping hand , my sister , _this_ is now thy tongue to me . ''
melville	pierre	`` i know not where to begin to speak to thee , pierre ; and yet my soul o'erbrims in me . '' `` from my heart 's depths , i love and reverence thee ; and feel for thee , backward and forward , through all eternity ! ''
melville	pierre	`` oh , pierre , can'st thou not cure in me this dreaminess , this bewilderingness i feel ? my poor head swims and swims , and will not pause . my life can not last long thus ; i am too full without discharge . conjure tears for me , pierre ; that my heart may not break with the present feeling , -- more death-like to me than all my grief gone by ! ''
melville	pierre	`` ye thirst-slaking evening skies , ye hilly dews and mists , distil your moisture here ! the bolt hath passed ; why comes not the following shower ? -- make her to weep ! '' then her head sought his support ; and big drops fell on him ; and anon , isabel gently slid her head from him , and sat a little composedly beside him .
melville	pierre	`` if thou feelest in endless arrears of thought to me , my sister ; so do i feel toward thee . i too , scarce know what i should speak to thee . but when thou lookest on me , my sister , thou beholdest one , who in his soul hath taken vows immutable , to be to thee , in all respects , and to the uttermost bounds and possibilities of fate , thy protecting and all-acknowledging brother ! ''
melville	pierre	`` not mere sounds of common words , but inmost tones of my heart 's deepest melodies should now be audible to thee . thou speakest to a human thing , but something heavenly should answer thee ; -- some flute heard in the air should answer thee ; for sure thy most undreamed-of accents , pierre , sure they have not been unheard on high . blessings that are imageless to all mortal fancyings , these shall be thine for this . ''
melville	pierre	`` blessing like to thine , doth but recoil and bless homeward to the heart that uttered it . i can not bless thee , my sister , as thou dost bless thyself in blessing my unworthiness . but , isabel , by still keeping present the first wonder of our meeting , we shall make our hearts all feebleness . let me then rehearse to thee what pierre is ; what life hitherto he hath been leading ; and what hereafter he shall lead ; -- so thou wilt be prepared . ''
melville	pierre	`` nay , pierre , that is my office ; thou art first entitled to my tale , then , if it suit thee , thou shalt make me the unentitled gift of thine . listen to me , now . the invisible things will give me strength ; -- it is not much , pierre ; -- nor aught very marvelous . listen then ; -- i feel soothed down to utterance now . ''
melville	pierre	during some brief , interluding , silent pauses in their interview thus far , pierre had heard a soft , slow , sad , to-and-fro , meditative stepping on the floor above ; and in the frequent pauses that intermitted the strange story in the following chapter , that same soft , slow , sad , to-and-fro , meditative , and most melancholy stepping , was again and again audible in the silent room .
melville	pierre	iii . `` i never knew a mortal mother . the farthest stretch of my life 's memory can not recall one single feature of such a face . if , indeed , mother of mine hath lived , she is long gone , and cast no shadow on the ground she trod . pierre , the lips that do now speak to thee , never touched a woman 's breast ; i seem not of woman born . my first dim life-thoughts cluster round an old , half-ruinous house in some region , for which i now have no chart to seek it out . if such a spot did ever really exist , that too seems to have been withdrawn from all the remainder of the earth . it was a wild , dark house , planted in the midst of a round , cleared , deeply-sloping space , scooped out of the middle of deep stunted pine woods . ever i shrunk at evening from peeping out of my window , lest the ghostly pines should steal near to me , and reach out their grim arms to snatch me into their horrid shadows . in summer the forest unceasingly hummed with unconjecturable voices of unknown birds and beasts . in winter its deep snows were traced like any paper map , with dotting night-tracks of four-footed creatures , that , even to the sun , were never visible , and never were seen by man at all . in the round open space the dark house stood , without one single green twig or leaf to shelter it ; shadeless and shelterless in the heart of shade and shelter . some of the windows were rudely boarded up , with boards nailed straight up and down ; and those rooms were utterly empty , and never were entered , though they were doorless . but often , from the echoing corridor , i gazed into them with fear ; for the great fire-places were all in ruins ; the lower tier of back-stones were burnt into one white , common crumbling ; and the black bricks above had fallen upon the hearths , heaped here and there with the still falling soot of long-extinguished fires . every hearth-stone in that house had one long crack through it ; every floor drooped at the corners ; and outside , the whole base of the house , where it rested on the low foundation of greenish stones , was strewn with dull , yellow molderings of the rotting sills . no name ; no scrawled or written thing ; no book , was in the house ; no one memorial speaking of its former occupants . it was dumb as death . no grave-stone , or mound , or any little hillock around the house , betrayed any past burials of man or child . and thus , with no trace then to me of its past history , thus it hath now entirely departed and perished from my slightest knowledge as to where that house so stood , or in what region it so stood . none other house like it have i ever seen . but once i saw plates of the outside of french chateaux which powerfully recalled its dim image to me , especially the two rows of small dormer windows projecting from the inverted hopper-roof . but that house was of wood , and these of stone . still , sometimes i think that house was not in this country , but somewhere in europe ; perhaps in france ; but it is all bewildering to me ; and so you must not start at me , for i can not but talk wildly upon so wild a theme .
melville	pierre	`` in this house i never saw any living human soul , but an old man and woman . the old man 's face was almost black with age , and was one purse of wrinkles , his hoary beard always tangled , streaked with dust and earthy crumbs . i think in summer he toiled a little in the garden , or some spot like that , which lay on one side of the house . all my ideas are in uncertainty and confusion here . but the old man and the old woman seem to have fastened themselves indelibly upon my memory . i suppose their being the only human things around me then , _that_ caused the hold they took upon me . they seldom spoke to me ; but would sometimes , of dark , gusty nights , sit by the fire and stare at me , and then mumble to each other , and then stare at me again . they were not entirely unkind to me ; but , i repeat , they seldom or never spoke to me . what words or language they used to each other , this it is impossible for me to recall . i have often wished to ; for then i might at least have some additional idea whether the house was in this country or somewhere beyond the sea . and here i ought to say , that sometimes i have , i know not what sort of vague remembrances of at one time -- shortly after the period i now speak of -- chattering in two different childish languages ; one of which waned in me as the other and latter grew . but more of this anon . it was the woman that gave me my meals ; for i did not eat with them . once they sat by the fire with a loaf between them , and a bottle of some thin sort of reddish wine ; and i went up to them , and asked to eat with them , and touched the loaf . but instantly the old man made a motion as if to strike me , but did not , and the woman , glaring at me , snatched the loaf and threw it into the fire before them . i ran frightened from the room ; and sought a cat , which i had often tried to coax into some intimacy , but , for some strange cause , without success . but in my frightened loneliness , then , i sought the cat again , and found her up-stairs , softly scratching for some hidden thing among the litter of the abandoned fire-places . i called to her , for i dared not go into the haunted chamber ; but she only gazed sideways and unintelligently toward me ; and continued her noiseless searchings . i called again , and then she turned round and hissed at me ; and i ran down stairs , still stung with the thought of having been driven away there , too . i now knew not where to go to rid myself of my loneliness . at last i went outside of the house , and sat down on a stone , but its coldness went up to my heart , and i rose and stood on my feet . but my head was dizzy ; i could not stand ; i fell , and knew no more . but next morning i found myself in bed in my uncheerable room , and some dark bread and a cup of water by me .
melville	pierre	`` it has only been by chance that i have told thee this one particular reminiscence of my early life in that house . i could tell many more like it , but this is enough to show what manner of life i led at that time . every day that i then lived , i felt all visible sights and all audible sounds growing stranger and stranger , and fearful and more fearful to me . to me the man and the woman were just like the cat ; none of them would speak to me ; none of them were comprehensible to me . and the man , and the woman , and the cat , were just like the green foundation stones of the house to me ; i knew not whence they came , or what cause they had for being there . i say again , no living human soul came to the house but the man and the woman ; but sometimes the old man early trudged away to a road that led through the woods , and would not come back till late in the evening ; he brought the dark bread , and the thin , reddish wine with him . though the entrance to the wood was not so very far from the door , yet he came so slowly and infirmly trudging with his little load , that it seemed weary hours on hours between my first descrying him among the trees , and his crossing the splintered threshold .
melville	pierre	`` now the wide and vacant blurrings of my early life thicken in my mind . all goes wholly memoryless to me now . it may have been that about that time i grew sick with some fever , in which for a long interval i lost myself . or it may be true , which i have heard , that after the period of our very earliest recollections , then a space intervenes of entire unknowingness , followed again by the first dim glimpses of the succeeding memory , more or less distinctly embracing all our past up to that one early gap in it .
melville	pierre	`` however this may be , nothing more can i recall of the house in the wide open space ; nothing of how at last i came to leave it ; but i must have been still extremely young then . but some uncertain , tossing memory have i of being at last in another round , open space , but immensely larger than the first one , and with no encircling belt of woods . yet often it seems to me that there were three tall , straight things like pine-trees somewhere there nigh to me at times ; and that they fearfully shook and snapt as the old trees used to in the mountain storms . and the floors seemed sometimes to droop at the corners still more steeply than the old floors did ; and changefully drooped too , so that i would even seem to feel them drooping under me .
melville	pierre	`` now , too , it was that , as it sometimes seems to me , i first and last chattered in the two childish languages i spoke of a little time ago . there seemed people about me , some of whom talked one , and some the other ; but i talked both ; yet one not so readily as the other ; and but beginningly as it were ; still this other was the one which was gradually displacing the former . the men who -- as it sometimes dreamily seems to me at times -- often climbed the three strange tree-like things , they talked -- i needs must think -- if indeed i have any real thought about so bodiless a phantom as this is -- they talked the language which i speak of as at this time gradually waning in me . it was a bonny tongue ; oh , seems to me so sparkling-gay and lightsome ; just the tongue for a child like me , if the child had not been so sad always . it was pure children 's language , pierre ; so twittering -- such a chirp .
melville	pierre	`` in thy own mind , thou must now perceive , that most of these dim remembrances in me , hint vaguely of a ship at sea . but all is dim and vague to me . scarce know i at any time whether i tell you real things , or the unrealest dreams . always in me , the solidest things melt into dreams , and dreams into solidities . never have i wholly recovered from the effects of my strange early life . this it is , that even now -- this moment -- surrounds thy visible form , my brother , with a mysterious mistiness ; so that a second face , and a third face , and a fourth face peep at me from within thy own . now dim , and more dim , grows in me all the memory of how thou and i did come to meet . i go groping again amid all sorts of shapes , which part to me ; so that i seem to advance through the shapes ; and yet the shapes have eyes that look at me . i turn round , and they look at me ; i step forward , and they look at me. -- let me be silent now ; do not speak to me . ''
melville	pierre	iv . filled with nameless wonderings at this strange being , pierre sat mute , intensely regarding her half-averted aspect . her immense soft tresses of the jettiest hair had slantingly fallen over her as though a curtain were half drawn from before some saint enshrined . to pierre , she seemed half unearthly ; but this unearthliness was only her mysteriousness , not any thing that was repelling or menacing to him . and still , the low melodies of her far interior voice hovered in sweet echoes in the room ; and were trodden upon , and pressed like gushing grapes , by the steady invisible pacing on the floor above .
melville	pierre	she moved a little now , and after some strange wanderings more coherently continued . `` my next memory which i think i can in some degree rely upon , was yet another house , also situated away from human haunts , in the heart of a not entirely silent country . through this country , and by the house , wound a green and lagging river . that house must have been in some lowland ; for the first house i spoke of seems to me to have been somewhere among mountains , or near to mountains ; -- the sounds of the far waterfalls , -- i seem to hear them now ; the steady up-pointed cloud-shapes behind the house in the sunset sky -- i seem to see them now . but this other house , this second one , or third one , i know not which , i say again it was in some lowland . there were no pines around it ; few trees of any sort ; the ground did not slope so steeply as around the first house . there were cultivated fields about it , and in the distance farm-houses , and out-houses , and cattle , and fowls , and many objects of that familiar sort . this house i am persuaded was in this country ; on this side of the sea . it was a very large house , and full of people ; but for the most part they lived separately . there were some old people in it , and there were young men , and young women in it , -- some very handsome ; and there were children in it . it seemed a happy place to some of these people ; many of them were always laughing ; but it was not a happy place for me .
melville	pierre	`` but here i may err , because of my own consciousness i can not identify in myself -- i mean in the memory of my whole foregoing life , -- i say , i can not identify that thing which is called happiness ; that thing whose token is a laugh , or a smile , or a silent serenity on the lip . i may have been happy , but it is not in my conscious memory now . nor do i feel a longing for it , as though i had never had it ; my spirit seeks different food from happiness ; for i think i have a suspicion of what it is . i have suffered wretchedness , but not because of the absence of happiness , and without praying for happiness . i pray for peace -- for motionlessness -- for the feeling of myself , as of some plant , absorbing life without seeking it , and existing without individual sensation . i feel that there can be no perfect peace in individualness . therefore i hope one day to feel myself drank up into the pervading spirit animating all things . i feel i am an exile here . i still go straying. -- yes ; in thy speech , thou smilest. -- but let me be silent again . do not answer me . when i resume , i will not wander so , but make short end . ''
melville	pierre	reverently resolved not to offer the slightest let or hinting hindrance to the singular tale rehearsing to him , but to sit passively and receive its marvelous droppings into his soul , however long the pauses ; and as touching less mystical considerations , persuaded that by so doing he should ultimately derive the least nebulous and imperfect account of isabel 's history ; pierre still sat waiting her resuming , his eyes fixed upon the girl 's wonderfully beautiful ear , which chancing to peep forth from among her abundant tresses , nestled in that blackness like a transparent sea-shell of pearl .
melville	pierre	she moved a little now ; and after some strange wanderings more coherently continued ; while the sound of the stepping on the floor above -- it seemed to cease . `` i have spoken of the second or rather the third spot in my memory of the past , as it first appeared to me ; i mean , i have spoken of the people in the house , according to my very earliest recallable impression of them . but i stayed in that house for several years -- five , six , perhaps , seven years -- and during that interval of my stay , all things changed to me , because i learned more , though always dimly . some of its occupants departed ; some changed from smiles to tears ; some went moping all the day ; some grew as savages and outrageous , and were dragged below by dumb-like men into deep places , that i knew nothing of , but dismal sounds came through the lower floor , groans and clanking fallings , as of iron in straw . now and then , i saw coffins silently at noon-day carried into the house , and in five minutes ' time emerge again , seemingly heavier than they entered ; but i saw not who was in them . once , i saw an immense-sized coffin , endwise pushed through a lower window by three men who did not speak ; and watching , i saw it pushed out again , and they drove off with it . but the numbers of those invisible persons who thus departed from the house , were made good by other invisible persons arriving in close carriages . some in rags and tatters came on foot , or rather were driven on foot . once i heard horrible outcries , and peeping from my window , saw a robust but squalid and distorted man , seemingly a peasant , tied by cords with four long ends to them , held behind by as many ignorant-looking men who with a lash drove the wild squalid being that way toward the house . then i heard answering hand-clappings , shrieks , howls , laughter , blessings , prayers , oaths , hymns , and all audible confusions issuing from all the chambers of the house .
melville	pierre	`` sometimes there entered the house -- though only transiently , departing within the hour they came -- people of a then remarkable aspect to me . they were very composed of countenance ; did not laugh ; did not groan ; did not weep ; did not make strange faces ; did not look endlessly fatigued ; were not strangely and fantastically dressed ; in short , did not at all resemble any people i had ever seen before , except a little like some few of the persons of the house , who seemed to have authority over the rest . these people of a remarkable aspect to me , i thought they were strangely demented people ; -- composed of countenance , but wandering of mind ; soul-composed and bodily-wandering , and strangely demented people .
melville	pierre	`` by-and-by , the house seemed to change again , or else my mind took in more , and modified its first impressions . i was lodged up-stairs in a little room ; there was hardly any furniture in the room ; sometimes i wished to go out of it ; but the door was locked . sometimes the people came and took me out of the room , into a much larger and very long room , and here i would collectively see many of the other people of the house , who seemed likewise brought from distant and separate chambers . in this long room they would vacantly roam about , and talk vacant talk to each other . some would stand in the middle of the room gazing steadily on the floor for hours together , and never stirred , but only breathed and gazed upon the floor . some would sit crouching in the corner , and sit crouching there , and only breathe and crouch in the corners . some kept their hands tight on their hearts , and went slowly promenading up and down , moaning and moaning to themselves . one would say to another -- '' feel of it -- here , put thy hand in the break . '' another would mutter -- '' broken , broken , broken '' -- and would mutter nothing but that one word broken . but most of them were dumb , and could not , or would not speak , or had forgotten how to speak . they were nearly all pale people . some had hair white as snow , and yet were quite young people . some were always talking about hell , eternity , and god ; and some of all things as fixedly decreed ; others would say nay to this , and then they would argue , but without much conviction either way . but once nearly all the people present -- even the dumb moping people , and the sluggish persons crouching in the corners -- nearly all of them laughed once , when after a whole day 's loud babbling , two of these predestinarian opponents , said each to the other -- 'thou hast convinced me , friend ; but we are quits ; for so also , have i convinced thee , the other way ; now then , let 's argue it all over again ; for still , though mutually converted , we are still at odds . ' some harangued the wall ; some apostrophized the air ; some hissed at the air ; some lolled their tongues out at the air ; some struck the air ; some made motions , as if wrestling with the air , and fell out of the arms of the air , panting from the invisible hug .
melville	pierre	`` now , as in the former thing , thou must , ere this , have suspected what manner of place this second or third house was , that i then lived in . but do not speak the word to me . that word has never passed my lips ; even now , when i hear the word , i run from it ; when i see it printed in a book , i run from the book . the word is wholly unendurable to me . who brought me to the house ; how i came there , i do not know . i lived a long time in the house ; that alone i know ; i say i know , but still i am uncertain ; still pierre , still the -- oh the dreaminess , the bewilderingness -- it never entirely leaves me . let me be still again . ''
melville	pierre	she leaned away from him ; she put her small hard hand to her forehead ; then moved it down , very slowly , but still hardly over her eyes , and kept it there , making no other sign , and still as death . then she moved and continued her vague tale of terribleness .
melville	pierre	`` i must be shorter ; i did not mean to turn off into the mere offshootings of my story , here and there ; but the dreaminess i speak of leads me sometimes ; and i , as impotent then , obey the dreamy prompting . bear with me ; now i will be briefer . ''
melville	pierre	`` it came to pass , at last , that there was a contention about me in the house ; some contention which i heard in the after rumor only , not at the actual time . some strangers had arrived ; or had come in haste , being sent for to the house . next day they dressed me in new and pretty , but still plain clothes , and they took me down stairs , and out into the air , and into a carriage with a pleasant-looking woman , a stranger to me ; and i was driven off a good way , two days nearly we drove away , stopping somewhere over-night ; and on the evening of the second day we came to another house , and went into it , and stayed there .
melville	pierre	`` this house was a much smaller one than the other , and seemed sweetly quiet to me after that . there was a beautiful infant in it ; and this beautiful infant always archly and innocently smiling on me , and strangely beckoning me to come and play with it , and be glad with it ; and be thoughtless , and be glad and gleeful with it ; this beautiful infant first brought me to my own mind , as it were ; first made me sensible that i was something different from stones , trees , cats ; first undid in me the fancy that all people were as stones , trees , cats ; first filled me with the sweet idea of humanness ; first made me aware of the infinite mercifulness , and tenderness , and beautifulness of humanness ; and this beautiful infant first filled me with the dim thought of beauty ; and equally , and at the same time , with the feeling of the sadness ; of the immortalness and universalness of the sadness . i now feel that i should soon have gone , -- -- stop me now ; do not let me go that way . i owe all things to that beautiful infant . oh , how i envied it , lying in its happy mother 's breast , and drawing life and gladness , and all its perpetual smilingness from that white and smiling breast . that infant saved me ; but still gave me vague desirings . now i first began to reflect in my mind ; to endeavor after the recalling past things ; but try as i would , little could i recall , but the bewilderingness ; -- and the stupor , and the torpor , and the blackness , and the dimness , and the vacant whirlingness of the bewilderingness . let me be still again . ''
melville	pierre	and the stepping on the floor above , -- it then resumed . v. `` i must have been nine , or ten , or eleven years old , when the pleasant-looking woman carried me away from the large house . she was a farmer 's wife ; and now that was my residence , the farm-house . they taught me to sew , and work with wool , and spin the wool ; i was nearly always busy now . this being busy , too , this it must have been , which partly brought to me the power of being sensible of myself as something human . now i began to feel strange differences . when i saw a snake trailing through the grass , and darting out the fire-fork from its mouth , i said to myself , that thing is not human , but i am human . when the lightning flashed , and split some beautiful tree , and left it to rot from all its greenness , i said , that lightning is not human , but i am human . and so with all other things . i can not speak coherently here ; but somehow i felt that all good , harmless men and women were human things , placed at cross-purposes , in a world of snakes and lightnings , in a world of horrible and inscrutable inhumanities . i have had no training of any sort . all my thoughts well up in me ; i know not whether they pertain to the old bewilderings or not ; but as they are , they are , and i can not alter them , for i had nothing to do with putting them in my mind , and i never affect any thoughts , and i never adulterate any thoughts ; but when i speak , think forth from the tongue , speech being sometimes before the thought ; so , often , my own tongue teaches me new things .
melville	pierre	`` now as yet i never had questioned the woman , or her husband , or the young girls , their children , why i had been brought to the house , or how long i was to stay in the house . there i was ; just as i found myself in the world ; there i was ; for what cause i had been brought into the world , would have been no stranger question to me , than for what cause i had been brought to the house . i knew nothing of myself , or any thing pertaining to myself ; i felt my pulse , my thought ; but other things i was ignorant of , except the general feeling of my humanness among the inhumanities . but as i grew older , i expanded in my mind . i began to learn things out of me ; to see still stranger , and minuter differences . i called the woman mother , and so did the other girls ; yet the woman often kissed them , but seldom me . she always helped them first at table . the farmer scarcely ever spoke to me . now months , years rolled on , and the young girls began to stare at me . then the bewilderingness of the old starings of the solitary old man and old woman , by the cracked hearth-stone of the desolate old house , in the desolate , round , open space ; the bewilderingness of those old starings now returned to me ; and the green starings , and the serpent hissings of the uncompanionable cat , recurred to me , and the feeling of the infinite forlornness of my life rolled over me . but the woman was very kind to me ; she taught the girls not to be cruel to me ; she would call me to her , and speak cheerfully to me , and i thanked -- not god , for i had been taught no god -- i thanked the bright human summer , and the joyful human sun in the sky ; i thanked the human summer and the sun , that they had given me the woman ; and i would sometimes steal away into the beautiful grass , and worship the kind summer and the sun ; and often say over to myself the soft words , summer and the sun .
melville	pierre	`` still , weeks and years ran on , and my hair began to vail me with its fullness and its length ; and now often i heard the word beautiful , spoken of my hair , and beautiful , spoken of myself . they would not say the word openly to me , but i would by chance overhear them whispering it . the word joyed me with the human feeling of it . they were wrong not to say it openly to me ; my joy would have been so much the more assured for the openness of their saying beautiful , to me ; and i know it would have filled me with all conceivable kindness toward every one . now i had heard the word beautiful , whispered , now and then , for some months , when a new being came to the house ; they called him gentleman . his face was wonderful to me . something strangely like it , and yet again unlike it , i had seen before , but where , i could not tell . but one day , looking into the smooth water behind the house , there i saw the likeness -- something strangely like , and yet unlike , the likeness of his face . this filled me with puzzlings . the new being , the gentleman , he was very gracious to me ; he seemed astonished , confounded at me ; he looked at me , then at a very little , round picture -- so it seemed -- which he took from his pocket , and yet concealed from me . then he kissed me , and looked with tenderness and grief upon me ; and i felt a tear fall on me from him . then he whispered a word into my ear . 'father , ' was the word he whispered ; the same word by which the young girls called the farmer . then i knew it was the word of kindness and of kisses . i kissed the gentleman .
melville	pierre	`` when he left the house i wept for him to come again . and he did come again . all called him my father now . he came to see me once every month or two ; till at last he came not at all ; and when i wept and asked for him , they said the word _dead_ to me . then the bewilderings of the comings and the goings of the coffins at the large and populous house ; these bewilderings came over me . what was it to be dead ? what is it to be living ? wherein is the difference between the words death and life ? had i been ever dead ? was i living ? let me be still again . do not speak to me . ''
melville	pierre	and the stepping on the floor above ; again it did resume . `` months ran on ; and now i somehow learned that my father had every now and then sent money to the woman to keep me with her in the house ; and that no more money had come to her after he was dead ; the last penny of the former money was now gone . now the farmer 's wife looked troubledly and painfully at me ; and the farmer looked unpleasantly and impatiently at me . i felt that something was miserably wrong ; i said to myself , i am one too many ; i must go away from the pleasant house . then the bewilderings of all the loneliness and forlornness of all my forlorn and lonely life ; all these bewilderings and the whelmings of the bewilderings rolled over me ; and i sat down without the house , but could not weep .
melville	pierre	`` but i was strong , and i was a grown girl now . i said to the woman -- keep me hard at work ; let me work all the time , but let me stay with thee . but the other girls were sufficient to do the work ; me they wanted not . the farmer looked out of his eyes at me , and the out-lookings of his eyes said plainly to me -- thee we do not want ; go from us ; thou art one too many ; and thou art more than one too many . then i said to the woman -- hire me out to some one ; let me work for some one. -- but i spread too wide my little story . i must make an end .
melville	pierre	`` the woman listened to me , and through her means i went to live at another house , and earned wages there . my work was milking the cows , and making butter , and spinning wool , and weaving carpets of thin strips of cloth . one day there came to this house a pedler . in his wagon he had a guitar , an old guitar , yet a very pretty one , but with broken strings . he had got it slyly in part exchange from the servants of a grand house some distance off . spite of the broken strings , the thing looked very graceful and beautiful to me ; and i knew there was melodiousness lurking in the thing , though i had never seen a guitar before , nor heard of one ; but there was a strange humming in my heart that seemed to prophesy of the hummings of the guitar . intuitively , i knew that the strings were not as they should be . i said to the man -- i will buy of thee the thing thou callest a guitar . but thou must put new strings to it . so he went to search for them ; and brought the strings , and restringing the guitar , tuned it for me . so with part of my earnings i bought the guitar . straightway i took it to my little chamber in the gable , and softly laid it on my bed . then i murmured ; sung and murmured to it ; very lowly , very softly ; i could hardly hear myself . and i changed the modulations of my singings and my murmurings ; and still sung , and murmured , lowly , softly , -- more and more ; and presently i heard a sudden sound : sweet and low beyond all telling was the sweet and sudden sound . i clapt my hands ; the guitar was speaking to me ; the dear guitar was singing to me ; murmuring and singing to me , the guitar . then i sung and murmured to it with a still different modulation ; and once more it answered me from a different string ; and once more it murmured to me , and it answered to me with a different string . the guitar was human ; the guitar taught me the secret of the guitar ; the guitar learned me to play on the guitar . no music-master have i ever had but the guitar . i made a loving friend of it ; a heart friend of it . it sings to me as i to it . love is not all on one side with my guitar . all the wonders that are unimaginable and unspeakable ; all these wonders are translated in the mysterious melodiousness of the guitar . it knows all my past history . sometimes it plays to me the mystic visions of the confused large house i never name . sometimes it brings to me the bird-twitterings in the air ; and sometimes it strikes up in me rapturous pulsations of legendary delights eternally unexperienced and unknown to me . bring me the guitar . ''
melville	pierre	vi . entranced , lost , as one wandering bedazzled and amazed among innumerable dancing lights , pierre had motionlessly listened to this abundant-haired , and large-eyed girl of mystery . `` bring me the guitar ! '' starting from his enchantment , pierre gazed round the room , and saw the instrument leaning against a corner . silently he brought it to the girl , and silently sat down again .
melville	pierre	`` now listen to the guitar ; and the guitar shall sing to thee the sequel of my story ; for not in words can it be spoken . so listen to the guitar . ''
melville	pierre	instantly the room was populous with sounds of melodiousness , and mournfulness , and wonderfulness ; the room swarmed with the unintelligible but delicious sounds . the sounds seemed waltzing in the room ; the sounds hung pendulous like glittering icicles from the corners of the room ; and fell upon him with a ringing silveryness ; and were drawn up again to the ceiling , and hung pendulous again , and dropt down upon him again with the ringing silveryness . fire-flies seemed buzzing in the sounds ; summer-lightnings seemed vividly yet softly audible in the sounds .
melville	pierre	and still the wild girl played on the guitar ; and her long dark shower of curls fell over it , and vailed it ; and still , out from the vail came the swarming sweetness , and the utter unintelligibleness , but the infinite significancies of the sounds of the guitar .
melville	pierre	`` girl of all-bewildering mystery ! '' cried pierre -- '' speak to me ; -- sister , if thou indeed canst be a thing that 's mortal -- speak to me , if thou be isabel ! '' `` mystery ! mystery ! mystery of isabel ! mystery ! mystery ! isabel and mystery ! ''
melville	pierre	among the waltzings , and the droppings , and the swarmings of the sounds , pierre now heard the tones above deftly stealing and winding among the myriad serpentinings of the other melody : -- deftly stealing and winding as respected the instrumental sounds , but in themselves wonderfully and abandonedly free and bold -- bounding and rebounding as from multitudinous reciprocal walls ; while with every syllable the hair-shrouded form of isabel swayed to and fro with a like abandonment , and suddenness , and wantonness : -- then it seemed not like any song ; seemed not issuing from any mouth ; but it came forth from beneath the same vail concealing the guitar .
melville	pierre	now a strange wild heat burned upon his brow ; he put his hand to it . instantly the music changed ; and drooped and changed ; and changed and changed ; and lingeringly retreated as it changed ; and at last was wholly gone .
melville	pierre	pierre was the first to break the silence . `` isabel , thou hast filled me with such wonderings ; i am so distraught with thee , that the particular things i had to tell to thee , when i hither came ; these things i can not now recall , to speak them to thee : -- i feel that something is still unsaid by thee , which at some other time thou wilt reveal . but now i can stay no longer with thee . know me eternally as thy loving , revering , and most marveling brother , who will never desert thee , isabel . now let me kiss thee and depart , till to-morrow night ; when i shall open to thee all my mind , and all my plans concerning me and thee . let me kiss thee , and adieu ! ''
melville	pierre	as full of unquestioning and unfaltering faith in him , the girl sat motionless and heard him out . then silently rose , and turned her boundlessly confiding brow to him . he kissed it thrice , and without another syllable left the place .
melville	pierre	book vii . intermediate between pierre 's two interviews with isabel at the farm-house . i . not immediately , not for a long time , could pierre fully , or by any approximation , realize the scene which he had just departed . but the vague revelation was now in him , that the visible world , some of which before had seemed but too common and prosaic to him ; and but too intelligible ; he now vaguely felt , that all the world , and every misconceivedly common and prosaic thing in it , was steeped a million fathoms in a mysteriousness wholly hopeless of solution . first , the enigmatical story of the girl , and the profound sincerity of it , and yet the ever accompanying haziness , obscurity , and almost miraculousness of it ; -- first , this wonderful story of the girl had displaced all commonness and prosaicness from his soul ; and then , the inexplicable spell of the guitar , and the subtleness of the melodious appealings of the few brief words from isabel sung in the conclusion of the melody -- all this had bewitched him , and enchanted him , till he had sat motionless and bending over , as a tree-transformed and mystery-laden visitant , caught and fast bound in some necromancer 's garden .
melville	pierre	but as now burst from these sorceries , he hurried along the open road , he strove for the time to dispel the mystic feeling , or at least postpone it for a while , until he should have time to rally both body and soul from the more immediate consequences of that day 's long fastings and wanderings , and that night 's never-to-be-forgotten scene . he now endeavored to beat away all thoughts from him , but of present bodily needs .
melville	pierre	passing through the silent village , he heard the clock tell the mid hour of night . hurrying on , he entered the mansion by a private door , the key of which hung in a secret outer place . without undressing , he flung himself upon the bed . but remembering himself again , he rose and adjusted his alarm-clock , so that it would emphatically repeat the hour of five . then to bed again , and driving off all intrudings of thoughtfulness , and resolutely bending himself to slumber , he by-and-by fell into its at first reluctant , but at last welcoming and hospitable arms . at five he rose ; and in the east saw the first spears of the advanced-guard of the day .
melville	pierre	it had been his purpose to go forth at that early hour , and so avoid all casual contact with any inmate of the mansion , and spend the entire day in a second wandering in the woods , as the only fit prelude to the society of so wild a being as his new-found sister isabel . but the familiar home-sights of his chamber strangely worked upon him . for an instant , he almost could have prayed isabel back into the wonder-world from which she had so slidingly emerged . for an instant , the fond , all-understood blue eyes of lucy displaced the as tender , but mournful and inscrutable dark glance of isabel . he seemed placed between them , to choose one or the other ; then both seemed his ; but into lucy 's eyes there stole half of the mournfulness of isabel 's , without diminishing hers .
melville	pierre	again the faintness , and the long life-weariness benumbed him . he left the mansion , and put his bare forehead against the restoring wind . he re-entered the mansion , and adjusted the clock to repeat emphatically the call of seven ; and then lay upon his bed . but now he could not sleep . at seven he changed his dress ; and at half-past eight went below to meet his mother at the breakfast table , having a little before overheard her step upon the stair .
melville	pierre	ii . he saluted her ; but she looked gravely and yet alarmedly , and then in a sudden , illy-repressed panic , upon him . then he knew he must be wonderfully changed . but his mother spoke not to him , only to return his good-morning . he saw that she was deeply offended with him , on many accounts ; moreover , that she was vaguely frightened about him , and finally that notwithstanding all this , her stung pride conquered all apprehensiveness in her ; and he knew his mother well enough to be very certain that , though he should unroll a magician 's parchment before her now , she would verbally express no interest , and seek no explanation from him . nevertheless , he could not entirely abstain from testing the power of her reservedness .
melville	pierre	`` i have been quite an absentee , sister mary , '' said he , with ill-affected pleasantness . `` yes , pierre . how does the coffee suit you this morning ? it is some new coffee . '' `` it is very nice ; very rich and odorous , sister mary . ''
melville	pierre	`` i am glad you find it so , pierre . '' `` why do n't you call me brother pierre ? '' `` have i not called you so ? well , then , brother pierre , -- is that better ? '' `` why do you look so indifferently and icily upon me , sister mary ? ''
melville	pierre	`` do i look indifferently and icily ? then i will endeavor to look otherwise . give me the toast there , pierre . '' `` you are very deeply offended at me , my dear mother . '' `` not in the slightest degree , pierre . have you seen lucy lately ? ''
melville	pierre	`` i have not , my mother . '' `` ah ! a bit of salmon , pierre . '' `` you are too proud to show toward me what you are this moment feeling , my mother . '' mrs. glendinning slowly rose to her feet , and her full stature of womanly beauty and majesty stood imposingly over him .
melville	pierre	`` tempt me no more , pierre . i will ask no secret from thee ; all shall be voluntary between us , as it ever has been , until very lately , or all shall be nothing between us . beware of me , pierre . there lives not that being in the world of whom thou hast more reason to beware , so you continue but a little longer to act thus with me . ''
melville	pierre	she reseated herself , and spoke no more . pierre kept silence ; and after snatching a few mouthfuls of he knew not what , silently quitted the table , and the room , and the mansion .
melville	pierre	iii . as the door of the breakfast-room closed upon pierre , mrs. glendinning rose , her fork unconsciously retained in her hand . presently , as she paced the room in deep , rapid thought , she became conscious of something strange in her grasp , and without looking at it , to mark what it was , impulsively flung it from her . a dashing noise was heard , and then a quivering . she turned ; and hanging by the side of pierre 's portrait , she saw her own smiling picture pierced through , and the fork , whose silver tines had caught in the painted bosom , vibratingly rankled in the wound .
melville	pierre	she advanced swiftly to the picture , and stood intrepidly before it . `` yes , thou art stabbed ! but the wrong hand stabbed thee ; this should have been _thy_ silver blow , '' turning to pierre 's portrait face . `` pierre , pierre , thou hast stabbed me with a poisoned point . i feel my blood chemically changing in me . i , the mother of the only surnamed glendinning , i feel now as though i had borne the last of a swiftly to be extinguished race . for swiftly to be extinguished is that race , whose only heir but so much as impends upon a deed of shame . and some deed of shame , or something most dubious and most dark , is in thy soul , or else some belying specter , with a cloudy , shame-faced front , sat at yon seat but now ! what can it be ? pierre , unbosom . smile not so lightly upon my heavy grief . answer ; what is it , boy ? can it ? can it ? no -- yes -- surely -- can it ? it can not be ! but he was not at lucy 's yesterday ; nor was she here ; and she would not see me when i called . what can this bode ? but not a mere broken match -- broken as lovers sometimes break , to mend the break with joyful tears , so soon again -- not a mere broken match can break my proud heart so . if that indeed be part , it is not all . but no , no , no ; it can not , can not be . he would not , could not , do so mad , so impious a thing . it was a most surprising face , though i confessed it not to him , nor even hinted that i saw it . but no , no , no , it can not be . such young peerlessness in such humbleness , can not have an honest origin . lilies are not stalked on weeds , though polluted , they sometimes may stand among them . she must be both poor and vile -- some chance-blow of a splendid , worthless rake , doomed to inherit both parts of her infecting portion -- vileness and beauty . no , i will not think it of him . but what then ? sometimes i have feared that my pride would work me some woe incurable , by closing both my lips , and varnishing all my front , where i perhaps ought to be wholly in the melted and invoking mood . but who can get at one 's own heart , to mend it ? right one 's self against another , that , one may sometimes do ; but when that other is one 's own self , these ribs forbid . then i will live my nature out . i will stand on pride . i will not budge . let come what will , i shall not half-way run to meet it , to beat it off . shall a mother abase herself before her stripling boy ? let him tell me of himself , or let him slide adown !

melville	pierre	iv . pierre plunged deep into the woods , and paused not for several miles ; paused not till he came to a remarkable stone , or rather , smoothed mass of rock , huge as a barn , which , wholly isolated horizontally , was yet sweepingly overarched by beech-trees and chestnuts .
melville	pierre	it was shaped something like a lengthened egg , but flattened more ; and , at the ends , pointed more ; and yet not pointed , but irregularly wedge-shaped . somewhere near the middle of its under side , there was a lateral ridge ; and an obscure point of this ridge rested on a second lengthwise-sharpened rock , slightly protruding from the ground . beside that one obscure and minute point of contact , the whole enormous and most ponderous mass touched not another object in the wide terraqueous world . it was a breathless thing to see . one broad haunched end hovered within an inch of the soil , all along to the point of teetering contact ; but yet touched not the soil . many feet from that -- beneath one part of the opposite end , which was all seamed and half-riven -- the vacancy was considerably larger , so as to make it not only possible , but convenient to admit a crawling man ; yet no mortal being had ever been known to have the intrepid heart to crawl there .
melville	pierre	it might well have been the wonder of all the country round . but strange to tell , though hundreds of cottage hearthstones -- where , of long winter-evenings , both old men smoked their pipes and young men shelled their corn -- surrounded it , at no very remote distance , yet had the youthful pierre been the first known publishing discoverer of this stone , which he had thereupon fancifully christened the memnon stone . possibly , the reason why this singular object had so long remained unblazoned to the world , was not so much because it had never before been lighted on -- though indeed , both belted and topped by the dense deep luxuriance of the aboriginal forest , it lay like captain kidd 's sunken hull in the gorge of the river hudson 's highlands , -- its crown being full eight fathoms under high-foliage mark during the great spring-tide of foliage ; -- and besides this , the cottagers had no special motive for visiting its more immediate vicinity at all ; their timber and fuel being obtained from more accessible woodlands -- as because , even , if any of the simple people should have chanced to have beheld it , they , in their hoodwinked unappreciativeness , would not have accounted it any very marvelous sight , and therefore , would never have thought it worth their while to publish it abroad . so that in real truth , they might have seen it , and yet afterward have forgotten so inconsiderable a circumstance . in short , this wondrous memnon stone could be no memnon stone to them ; nothing but a huge stumbling-block , deeply to be regretted as a vast prospective obstacle in the way of running a handy little cross-road through that wild part of the manor .
melville	pierre	now one day while reclining near its flank , and intently eying it , and thinking how surprising it was , that in so long-settled a country he should have been the first discerning and appreciative person to light upon such a great natural curiosity , pierre happened to brush aside several successive layers of old , gray-haired , close cropped , nappy moss , and beneath , to his no small amazement , he saw rudely hammered in the rock some half-obliterate initials -- '' s. ye w. '' then he knew , that ignorant of the stone , as all the simple country round might immemorially have been , yet was not himself the only human being who had discovered that marvelous impending spectacle : but long and long ago , in quite another age , the stone had been beheld , and its wonderfulness fully appreciated -- as the painstaking initials seemed to testify -- by some departed man , who , were he now alive , might possibly wag a beard old as the most venerable oak of centuries ' growth . but who , -- who in methuselah 's name , -- who might have been this `` s. ye w ? '' pierre pondered long , but could not possibly imagine ; for the initials , in their antiqueness , seemed to point to some period before the era of columbus ' discovery of the hemisphere . happening in the end to mention the strange matter of these initials to a white-haired old gentleman , his city kinsman , who , after a long and richly varied , but unfortunate life , had at last found great solace in the old testament , which he was continually studying with ever-increasing admiration ; this white-haired old kinsman , after having learnt all the particulars about the stone -- its bulk , its height , the precise angle of its critical impendings , and all that , -- and then , after much prolonged cogitation upon it , and several long-drawn sighs , and aged looks of hoar significance , and reading certain verses in ecclesiastes ; after all these tedious preliminaries , this not-at-all-to-be-hurried white-haired old kinsman , had laid his tremulous hand upon pierre 's firm young shoulder , and slowly whispered -- '' boy ; 't is solomon the wise . '' pierre could not repress a merry laugh at this ; wonderfully diverted by what seemed to him so queer and crotchety a conceit ; which he imputed to the alledged dotage of his venerable kinsman , who he well knew had once maintained , that the old scriptural ophir was somewhere on our northern sea-coast ; so no wonder the old gentleman should fancy that king solomon might have taken a trip -- as a sort of amateur supercargo -- of some tyre or sidon gold-ship across the water , and happened to light on the memnon stone , while rambling about with bow and quiver shooting partridges .
melville	pierre	but merriment was by no means pierre 's usual mood when thinking of this stone ; much less when seated in the woods , he , in the profound significance of that deep forest silence , viewed its marvelous impendings . a flitting conceit had often crossed him , that he would like nothing better for a head-stone than this same imposing pile ; in which , at times , during the soft swayings of the surrounding foliage , there seemed to lurk some mournful and lamenting plaint , as for some sweet boy long since departed in the antediluvian time .
melville	pierre	not only might this stone well have been the wonder of the simple country round , but it might well have been its terror . sometimes , wrought to a mystic mood by contemplating its ponderous inscrutableness , pierre had called it the terror stone . few could be bribed to climb its giddy height , and crawl out upon its more hovering end . it seemed as if the dropping of one seed from the beak of the smallest flying bird would topple the immense mass over , crashing against the trees .
melville	pierre	it was a very familiar thing to pierre ; he had often climbed it , by placing long poles against it , and so creeping up to where it sloped in little crumbling stepping-places ; or by climbing high up the neighboring beeches , and then lowering himself down upon the forehead-like summit by the elastic branches . but never had he been fearless enough -- or rather fool-hardy enough , it may be , to crawl on the ground beneath the vacancy of the higher end ; that spot first menaced by the terror stone should it ever really topple .
melville	pierre	v. yet now advancing steadily , and as if by some interior pre-determination , and eying the mass unfalteringly ; he then threw himself prone upon the wood 's last year 's leaves , and slid himself straight into the horrible interspace , and lay there as dead . he spoke not , for speechless thoughts were in him . these gave place at last to things less and less unspeakable ; till at last , from beneath the very brow of the beetlings and the menacings of the terror stone came the audible words of pierre : --
melville	pierre	`` if the miseries of the undisclosable things in me , shall ever unhorse me from my manhood 's seat ; if to vow myself all virtue 's and all truth 's , be but to make a trembling , distrusted slave of me ; if life is to prove a burden i can not bear without ignominious cringings ; if indeed our actions are all fore-ordained , and we are russian serfs to fate ; if invisible devils do titter at us when we most nobly strive ; if life be a cheating dream , and virtue as unmeaning and unsequeled with any blessing as the midnight mirth of wine ; if by sacrificing myself for duty 's sake , my own mother re-sacrifices me ; if duty 's self be but a bugbear , and all things are allowable and unpunishable to man ; -- then do thou , mute massiveness , fall on me ! ages thou hast waited ; and if these things be thus , then wait no more ; for whom better canst thou crush than him who now lies here invoking thee ? ''
melville	pierre	a down-darting bird , all song , swiftly lighted on the unmoved and eternally immovable balancings of the terror stone , and cheerfully chirped to pierre . the tree-boughs bent and waved to the rushes of a sudden , balmy wind ; and slowly pierre crawled forth , and stood haughtily upon his feet , as he owed thanks to none , and went his moody way .
melville	pierre	vi . when in his imaginative ruminating moods of early youth , pierre had christened the wonderful stone by the old resounding name of memnon , he had done so merely from certain associative remembrances of that egyptian marvel , of which all eastern travelers speak . and when the fugitive thought had long ago entered him of desiring that same stone for his head-stone , when he should be no more ; then he had only yielded to one of those innumerable fanciful notions , tinged with dreamy painless melancholy , which are frequently suggested to the mind of a poetic boy . but in after-times , when placed in far different circumstances from those surrounding him at the meadows , pierre pondered on the stone , and his young thoughts concerning it , and , later , his desperate act in crawling under it ; then an immense significance came to him , and the long-passed unconscious movements of his then youthful heart seemed now prophetic to him , and allegorically verified by the subsequent events .
melville	pierre	for , not to speak of the other and subtler meanings which lie crouching behind the colossal haunches of this stone , regarded as the menacingly impending terror stone -- hidden to all the simple cottagers , but revealed to pierre -- consider its aspects as the memnon stone . for memnon was that dewey , royal boy , son of aurora , and born king of egypt , who , with enthusiastic rashness flinging himself on another 's account into a rightful quarrel , fought hand to hand with his overmatch , and met his boyish and most dolorous death beneath the walls of troy . his wailing subjects built a monument in egypt to commemorate his untimely fate . touched by the breath of the bereaved aurora , every sunrise that statue gave forth a mournful broken sound , as of a harp-string suddenly sundered , being too harshly wound .
melville	pierre	herein lies an unsummed world of grief . for in this plaintive fable we find embodied the hamletism of the antique world ; the hamletism of three thousand years ago : `` the flower of virtue cropped by a too rare mischance . '' and the english tragedy is but egyptian memnon , montaignized and modernized ; for being but a mortal man shakspeare had his fathers too .
melville	pierre	now as the memnon statue survives down to this present day , so does that nobly-striving but ever-shipwrecked character in some royal youths ( for both memnon and hamlet were the sons of kings ) , of which that statue is the melancholy type . but memnon 's sculptured woes did once melodiously resound ; now all is mute . fit emblem that of old , poetry was a consecration and an obsequy to all hapless modes of human life ; but in a bantering , barren , and prosaic , heartless age , aurora 's music-moan is lost among our drifting sands which whelm alike the monument and the dirge .
melville	pierre	vii . as pierre went on through the woods , all thoughts now left him but those investing isabel . he strove to condense her mysterious haze into some definite and comprehensible shape . he could not but infer that the feeling of bewilderment , which she had so often hinted of during their interview , had caused her continually to go aside from the straight line of her narration ; and finally to end it in an abrupt and enigmatical obscurity . but he also felt assured , that as this was entirely unintended , and now , doubtless , regretted by herself , so their coming second interview would help to clear up much of this mysteriousness ; considering that the elapsing interval would do much to tranquilize her , and rally her into less of wonderfulness to him ; he did not therefore so much accuse his unthinkingness in naming the postponing hour he had . for , indeed , looking from the morning down the vista of the day , it seemed as indefinite and interminable to him . he could not bring himself to confront any face or house ; a plowed field , any sign of tillage , the rotted stump of a long-felled pine , the slightest passing trace of man was uncongenial and repelling to him . likewise in his own mind all remembrances and imaginings that had to do with the common and general humanity had become , for the time , in the most singular manner distasteful to him . still , while thus loathing all that was common in the two different worlds -- that without , and that within -- nevertheless , even in the most withdrawn and subtlest region of his own essential spirit , pierre could not now find one single agreeable twig of thought whereon to perch his weary soul .
melville	pierre	men in general seldom suffer from this utter pauperism of the spirit . if god hath not blessed them with incurable frivolity , men in general have still some secret thing of self-conceit or virtuous gratulation ; men in general have always done some small self-sacrificing deed for some other man ; and so , in those now and then recurring hours of despondent lassitude , which must at various and differing intervals overtake almost every civilized human being ; such persons straightway bethink them of their one , or two , or three small self-sacrificing things , and suck respite , consolation , and more or less compensating deliciousness from it . but with men of self-disdainful spirits ; in whose chosen souls heaven itself hath by a primitive persuasion unindoctrinally fixed that most true christian doctrine of the utter nothingness of good works ; the casual remembrance of their benevolent well-doings , does never distill one drop of comfort for them , even as ( in harmony with the correlative scripture doctrine ) the recalling of their outlived errors and mis-deeds , conveys to them no slightest pang or shadow of reproach .
melville	pierre	though the clew-defying mysteriousness of isabel 's narration , did now for the time , in this particular mood of his , put on a repelling aspect to our pierre ; yet something must occupy the soul of man ; and isabel was nearest to him then ; and isabel he thought of ; at first , with great discomfort and with pain , but anon ( for heaven eventually rewards the resolute and duteous thinker ) with lessening repugnance , and at last with still-increasing willingness and congenialness . now he recalled his first impressions , here and there , while she was rehearsing to him her wild tale ; he recalled those swift but mystical corroborations in his own mind and memory , which by shedding another twinkling light upon her history , had but increased its mystery , while at the same time remarkably substantiating it .
melville	pierre	her first recallable recollection was of an old deserted chateau-like house in a strange , french-like country , which she dimly imagined to be somewhere beyond the sea . did not this surprisingly correspond with certain natural inferences to be drawn from his aunt dorothea 's account of the disappearance of the french young lady ? yes ; the french young lady 's disappearance on this side the water was only contingent upon her reappearance on the other ; then he shuddered as he darkly pictured the possible sequel of her life , and the wresting from her of her infant , and its immurement in the savage mountain wilderness .
melville	pierre	but isabel had also vague impressions of herself crossing the sea ; -- _re_crossing , emphatically thought pierre , as he pondered on the unbidden conceit , that she had probably first unconsciously and smuggledly crossed it hidden beneath her sorrowing mother 's heart . but in attempting to draw any inferences , from what he himself had ever heard , for a coinciding proof or elucidation of this assumption of isabel 's actual crossing the sea at so tender an age ; here pierre felt all the inadequateness of both his own and isabel 's united knowledge , to clear up the profound mysteriousness of her early life . to the certainty of this irremovable obscurity he bowed himself , and strove to dismiss it from his mind , as worse than hopeless . so , also , in a good degree , did he endeavor to drive out of him , isabel 's reminiscence of the , to her , unnameable large house , from which she had been finally removed by the pleasant woman in the coach . this episode in her life , above all other things , was most cruelly suggestive to him , as possibly involving his father in the privity to a thing , at which pierre 's inmost soul fainted with amazement and abhorrence . here the helplessness of all further light , and the eternal impossibility of logically exonerating his dead father , in his own mind , from the liability to this , and many other of the blackest self-insinuated suppositions ; all this came over pierre with a power so infernal and intense , that it could only have proceeded from the unretarded malice of the evil one himself . but subtilly and wantonly as these conceits stole into him , pierre as subtilly opposed them ; and with the hue-and-cry of his whole indignant soul , pursued them forth again into the wide tartarean realm from which they had emerged .
melville	pierre	the more and the more that pierre now revolved the story of isabel in his mind , so much the more he amended his original idea , that much of its obscurity would depart upon a second interview . he saw , or seemed to see , that it was not so much isabel who had by her wild idiosyncrasies mystified the narration of her history , as it was the essential and unavoidable mystery of her history itself , which had invested isabel with such wonderful enigmas to him .
melville	pierre	viii . the issue of these reconsiderings was the conviction , that all he could now reasonably anticipate from isabel , in further disclosure on the subject of her life , were some few additional particulars bringing it down to the present moment ; and , also , possibly filling out the latter portion of what she had already revealed to him . nor here , could he persuade himself , that she would have much to say . isabel had not been so digressive and withholding as he had thought . what more , indeed , could she now have to impart , except by what strange means she had at last come to find her brother out ; and the dreary recital of how she had pecuniarily wrestled with her destitute condition ; how she had come to leave one place of toiling refuge for another , till now he found her in humble servitude at farmer ulver 's ? is it possible then , thought pierre , that there lives a human creature in this common world of everydays , whose whole history may be told in little less than two-score words , and yet embody in that smallness a fathomless fountain of ever-welling mystery ? is it possible , after all , that spite of bricks and shaven faces , this world we live in is brimmed with wonders , and i and all mankind , beneath our garbs of common-placeness , conceal enigmas that the stars themselves , and perhaps the highest seraphim can not resolve ?
melville	pierre	the intuitively certain , however literally unproven fact of isabel 's sisterhood to him , was a link that he now felt binding him to a before unimagined and endless chain of wondering . his very blood seemed to flow through all his arteries with unwonted subtileness , when he thought that the same tide flowed through the mystic veins of isabel . all his occasional pangs of dubiousness as to the grand governing thing of all -- the reality of the physical relationship -- only recoiled back upon him with added tribute of both certainty and insolubleness .
melville	pierre	she is my sister -- my own father 's daughter . well ; why do i believe it ? the other day i had not so much as heard the remotest rumor of her existence ; and what has since occurred to change me ? what so new and incontestable vouchers have i handled ? none at all . but i have seen her . well ; grant it ; i might have seen a thousand other girls , whom i had never seen before ; but for that , i would not own any one among them for my sister . but the portrait , the chair-portrait , pierre ? think of that . but that was painted before isabel was born ; what can that portrait have to do with isabel ? it is not the portrait of isabel , it is my father 's portrait ; and yet my mother swears it is not he .
melville	pierre	now alive as he was to all these searching argumentative itemizings of the minutest known facts any way bearing upon the subject ; and yet , at the same time , persuaded , strong as death , that in spite of them , isabel was indeed his sister ; how could pierre , naturally poetic , and therefore piercing as he was ; how could he fail to acknowledge the existence of that all-controlling and all-permeating wonderfulness , which , when imperfectly and isolatedly recognized by the generality , is so significantly denominated the finger of god ? but it is not merely the finger , it is the whole outspread hand of god ; for doth not scripture intimate , that he holdeth all of us in the hollow of his hand ? -- a hollow , truly !
melville	pierre	still wandering through the forest , his eye pursuing its ever-shifting shadowy vistas ; remote from all visible haunts and traces of that strangely wilful race , who , in the sordid traffickings of clay and mud , are ever seeking to denationalize the natural heavenliness of their souls ; there came into the mind of pierre , thoughts and fancies never imbibed within the gates of towns ; but only given forth by the atmosphere of primeval forests , which , with the eternal ocean , are the only unchanged general objects remaining to this day , from those that originally met the gaze of adam . for so it is , that the apparently most inflammable or evaporable of all earthly things , wood and water , are , in this view , immensely the most endurable .
melville	pierre	now all his ponderings , however excursive , wheeled round isabel as their center ; and back to her they came again from every excursion ; and again derived some new , small germs for wonderment .
melville	pierre	the question of time occurred to pierre . how old was isabel ? according to all reasonable inferences from the presumed circumstances of her life , she was his elder , certainly , though by uncertain years ; yet her whole aspect was that of more than childlikeness ; nevertheless , not only did he feel his muscular superiority to her , so to speak , which made him spontaneously alive to a feeling of elderly protectingness over her ; not only did he experience the thoughts of superior world-acquaintance , and general cultured knowledge ; but spite of reason 's self , and irrespective of all mere computings , he was conscious of a feeling which independently pronounced him her senior in point of time , and isabel a child of everlasting youngness . this strange , though strong conceit of his mysterious persuasion , doubtless , had its untraced , and but little-suspected origin in his mind , from ideas born of his devout meditations upon the artless infantileness of her face ; which , though profoundly mournful in the general expression , yet did not , by any means , for that cause , lose one whit in its singular infantileness ; as the faces of real infants , in their earliest visibleness , do oft-times wear a look of deep and endless sadness . but it was not the sadness , nor indeed , strictly speaking , the infantileness of the face of isabel which so singularly impressed him with the idea of her original and changeless youthfulness . it was something else ; yet something which entirely eluded him .
melville	pierre	imaginatively exalted by the willing suffrages of all mankind into higher and purer realms than men themselves inhabit ; beautiful women -- those of them at least who are beautiful in soul as well as body -- do , notwithstanding the relentless law of earthly fleetingness , still seem , for a long interval , mysteriously exempt from the incantations of decay ; for as the outward loveliness touch by touch departs , the interior beauty touch by touch replaces that departing bloom , with charms , which , underivable from earth , possess the ineffaceableness of stars . else , why at the age of sixty , have some women held in the strongest bonds of love and fealty , men young enough to be their grandsons ? and why did all-seducing ninon unintendingly break scores of hearts at seventy ? it is because of the perennialness of womanly sweetness .
melville	pierre	out from the infantile , yet eternal mournfulness of the face of isabel , there looked on pierre that angelic childlikeness , which our savior hints is the one only investiture of translated souls ; for of such -- even of little children -- is the other world .
melville	pierre	now , unending as the wonderful rivers , which once bathed the feet of the primeval generations , and still remain to flow fast by the graves of all succeeding men , and by the beds of all now living ; unending , ever-flowing , ran through the soul of pierre , fresh and fresher , further and still further , thoughts of isabel . but the more his thoughtful river ran , the more mysteriousness it floated to him ; and yet the more certainty that the mysteriousness was unchangeable . in her life there was an unraveled plot ; and he felt that unraveled it would eternally remain to him . no slightest hope or dream had he , that what was dark and mournful in her would ever be cleared up into some coming atmosphere of light and mirth . like all youths , pierre had conned his novel-lessons ; had read more novels than most persons of his years ; but their false , inverted attempts at systematizing eternally unsystemizable elements ; their audacious , intermeddling impotency , in trying to unravel , and spread out , and classify , the more thin than gossamer threads which make up the complex web of life ; these things over pierre had no power now . straight through their helpless miserableness he pierced ; the one sensational truth in him transfixed like beetles all the speculative lies in them . he saw that human life doth truly come from that , which all men are agreed to call by the name of _god_ ; and that it partakes of the unravelable inscrutableness of god . by infallible presentiment he saw , that not always doth life 's beginning gloom conclude in gladness ; that wedding-bells peal not ever in the last scene of life 's fifth act ; that while the countless tribes of common novels laboriously spin veils of mystery , only to complacently clear them up at last ; and while the countless tribe of common dramas do but repeat the same ; yet the profounder emanations of the human mind , intended to illustrate all that can be humanly known of human life ; these never unravel their own intricacies , and have no proper endings ; but in imperfect , unanticipated , and disappointing sequels ( as mutilated stumps ) , hurry to abrupt intermergings with the eternal tides of time and fate .
melville	pierre	so pierre renounced all thought of ever having isabel 's dark lantern illuminated to him . her light was lidded , and the lid was locked . nor did he feel a pang at this . by posting hither and thither among the reminiscences of his family , and craftily interrogating his remaining relatives on his father 's side , he might possibly rake forth some few small grains of dubious and most unsatisfying things , which , were he that way strongly bent , would only serve the more hopelessly to cripple him in his practical resolves . he determined to pry not at all into this sacred problem . for him now the mystery of isabel possessed all the bewitchingness of the mysterious vault of night , whose very darkness evokes the witchery .
melville	pierre	the thoughtful river still ran on in him , and now it floated still another thing to him . though the letter of isabel gushed with all a sister 's sacred longings to embrace her brother , and in the most abandoned terms painted the anguish of her life-long estrangement from him ; and though , in effect , it took vows to this , -- that without his continual love and sympathy , further life for her was only fit to be thrown into the nearest unfathomed pool , or rushing stream ; yet when the brother and the sister had encountered , according to the set appointment , none of these impassionedments had been repeated . she had more than thrice thanked god , and most earnestly blessed himself , that now he had come near to her in her loneliness ; but no gesture of common and customary sisterly affection . nay , from his embrace had she not struggled ? nor kissed him once ; nor had he kissed her , except when the salute was solely sought by him .
melville	pierre	now pierre began to see mysteries interpierced with mysteries , and mysteries eluding mysteries ; and began to seem to see the mere imaginariness of the so supposed solidest principle of human association . fate had done this thing for them . fate had separated the brother and the sister , till to each other they somehow seemed so not at all . sisters shrink not from their brother 's kisses . and pierre felt that never , never would he be able to embrace isabel with the mere brotherly embrace ; while the thought of any other caress , which took hold of any domesticness , was entirely vacant from his uncontaminated soul , for it had never consciously intruded there .
melville	pierre	therefore , forever unsistered for him by the stroke of fate , and apparently forever , and twice removed from the remotest possibility of that love which had drawn him to his lucy ; yet still the object of the ardentest and deepest emotions of his soul ; therefore , to him , isabel wholly soared out of the realms of mortalness , and for him became transfigured in the highest heaven of uncorrupted love .
melville	pierre	book viii . the second interview at the farm-house , and the second part of the story of isabel . their immediate impulsive effect upon pierre . i . his second interview with isabel was more satisfying , but none the less affecting and mystical than the first , though in the beginning , to his no small surprise , it was far more strange and embarrassing .
melville	pierre	as before , isabel herself admitted him into the farm-house , and spoke no word to him till they were both seated in the room of the double casement , and himself had first addressed her . if pierre had any way predetermined how to deport himself at the moment , it was to manifest by some outward token the utmost affection for his sister ; but her rapt silence and that atmosphere of unearthliness which invested her , now froze him to his seat ; his arms refused to open , his lips refused to meet in the fraternal kiss ; while all the while his heart was overflowing with the deepest love , and he knew full well , that his presence was inexpressibly grateful to the girl . never did love and reverence so intimately react and blend ; never did pity so join with wonder in casting a spell upon the movements of his body , and impeding him in its command .
melville	pierre	after a few embarrassed words from pierre , and a brief reply , a pause ensued , during which not only was the slow , soft stepping overhead quite audible , as at intervals on the night before , but also some slight domestic sounds were heard from the adjoining room ; and noticing the unconsciously interrogating expression of pierre 's face , isabel thus spoke to him :
melville	pierre	`` i feel , my brother , that thou dost appreciate the peculiarity and the mystery of my life , and of myself , and therefore i am at rest concerning the possibility of thy misconstruing any of my actions . it is only when people refuse to admit the uncommonness of some persons and the circumstances surrounding them , that erroneous conceits are nourished , and their feelings pained . my brother , if ever i shall seem reserved and unembracing to thee , still thou must ever trust the heart of isabel , and permit no doubt to cross thee there . my brother , the sounds thou hast just overheard in yonder room , have suggested to thee interesting questions connected with myself . do not speak ; i fervently understand thee . i will tell thee upon what terms i have been living here ; and how it is that i , a hired person , am enabled to receive thee in this seemly privacy ; for as thou mayest very readily imagine , this room is not my own . and this reminds me also that i have yet some few further trifling things to tell thee respecting the circumstances which have ended in bestowing upon me so angelical a brother . ''
melville	pierre	`` i can not retain that word '' -- said pierre , with earnest lowness , and drawing a little nearer to her -- '' of right , it only pertains to thee . '' `` my brother , i will now go on , and tell thee all that i think thou couldst wish to know , in addition to what was so dimly rehearsed last night . some three months ago , the people of the distant farm-house , where i was then staying , broke up their household and departed for some western country . no place immediately presented itself where my services were wanted , but i was hospitably received at an old neighbor 's hearth , and most kindly invited to tarry there , till some employ should offer . but i did not wait for chance to help me ; my inquiries resulted in ascertaining the sad story of delly ulver , and that through the fate which had overtaken her , her aged parents were not only plunged into the most poignant grief , but were deprived of the domestic help of an only daughter , a circumstance whose deep discomfort can not be easily realized by persons who have always been ministered to by servants . though indeed my natural mood -- if i may call it so , for want of a better term -- was strangely touched by thinking that the misery of delly should be the source of benefit to me ; yet this had no practically operative effect upon me , -- my most inmost and truest thoughts seldom have ; -- and so i came hither , and my hands will testify that i did not come entirely for naught . now , my brother , since thou didst leave me yesterday , i have felt no small surprise , that thou didst not then seek from me , how and when i came to learn the name of glendinning as so closely associated with myself ; and how i came to know saddle meadows to be the family seat , and how i at last resolved upon addressing thee , pierre , and none other ; and to what may be attributed that very memorable scene in the sewing-circle at the miss pennies . ''
melville	pierre	`` i have myself been wondering at myself that these things should hitherto have so entirely absented themselves from my mind , '' responded pierre ; -- '' but truly , isabel , thy all-abounding hair falls upon me with some spell which dismisses all ordinary considerations from me , and leaves me only sensible to the nubian power in thine eyes . but go on , and tell me every thing and any thing . i desire to know all , isabel , and yet , nothing which thou wilt not voluntarily disclose . i feel that already i know the pith of all ; that already i feel toward thee to the very limit of all ; and that , whatever remains for thee to tell me , can but corroborate and confirm . so go on , my dearest , -- ay , my only sister .

melville	pierre	isabel fixed her wonderful eyes upon him with a gaze of long impassionment ; then rose suddenly to her feet , and advanced swiftly toward him ; but more suddenly paused , and reseated herself in silence , and continued so for a time , with her head averted from him , and mutely resting on her hand , gazing out of the open casement upon the soft heat-lightning , occasionally revealed there .
melville	pierre	she resumed anon . ii . `` my brother , thou wilt remember that certain part of my story which in reference to my more childish years spent remote from here , introduced the gentleman -- my -- yes , _our_ father , pierre . i can not describe to thee , for indeed , i do not myself comprehend how it was , that though at the time i sometimes called him my father , and the people of the house also called him so , sometimes when speaking of him to me ; yet -- partly , i suppose , because of the extraordinary secludedness of my previous life -- i did not then join in my mind with the word father , all those peculiar associations which the term ordinarily inspires in children . the word father only seemed a word of general love and endearment to me -- little or nothing more ; it did not seem to involve any claims of any sort , one way or the other . i did not ask the name of my father ; for i could have had no motive to hear him named , except to individualize the person who was so peculiarly kind to me ; and individualized in that way he already was , since he was generally called by us _the gentleman_ , and sometimes _my father_ . as i have no reason to suppose that had i then or afterward , questioned the people of the house as to what more particular name my father went by in the world , they would have at all disclosed it to me ; and , indeed , since , for certain singular reasons , i now feel convinced that on that point they were pledged to secrecy ; i do not know that i ever would have come to learn my father 's name , -- and by consequence , ever have learned the least shade or shadow of knowledge as to you , pierre , or any of your kin -- had it not been for the merest little accident , which early revealed it to me , though at the moment i did not know the value of that knowledge . the last time my father visited the house , he chanced to leave his handkerchief behind him . it was the farmer 's wife who first discovered it . she picked it up , and fumbling at it a moment , as if rapidly examining the corners , tossed it to me , saying , 'here , isabel , here is the good gentleman 's handkerchief ; keep it for him now , till he comes to see little bell again . ' gladly i caught the handkerchief , and put it into my bosom . it was a white one ; and upon closely scanning it , i found a small line of fine faded yellowish writing in the middle of it . at that time i could not read either print or writing , so i was none the wiser then ; but still , some secret instinct told me , that the woman would not so freely have given me the handkerchief , had she known there was any writing on it . i forbore questioning her on the subject ; i waited till my father should return , to secretly question him . the handkerchief had become dusty by lying on the uncarpeted floor . i took it to the brook and washed it , and laid it out on the grass where none would chance to pass ; and i ironed it under my little apron , so that none would be attracted to it , to look at it again . but my father never returned ; so , in my grief , the handkerchief became the more and the more endeared to me ; it absorbed many of the secret tears i wept in memory of my dear departed friend , whom , in my child-like ignorance , i then equally called _my father_ and _the gentleman_ . but when the impression of his death became a fixed thing to me , then again i washed and dried and ironed the precious memorial of him , and put it away where none should find it but myself , and resolved never more to soil it with my tears ; and i folded it in such a manner , that the name was invisibly buried in the heart of it , and it was like opening a book and turning over many blank leaves before i came to the mysterious writing , which i knew should be one day read by me , without direct help from any one . now i resolved to learn my letters , and learn to read , in order that of myself i might learn the meaning of those faded characters . no other purpose but that only one , did i have in learning then to read . i easily induced the woman to give me my little teachings , and being uncommonly quick , and moreover , most eager to learn , i soon mastered the alphabet , and went on to spelling , and by-and-by to reading , and at last to the complete deciphering of the talismanic word -- glendinning . i was yet very ignorant . _glendinning_ , thought i , what is that ? it sounds something like _gentleman_ ; -- glen-din-ning ; -- just as many syllables as _gentleman_ ; and -- g -- it begins with the same letter ; yes , it must mean _my father_ . i will think of him by that word now ; -- i will not think of the _gentleman_ , but of _glendinning_ . when at last i removed from that house and went to another , and still another , and as i still grew up and thought more to myself , that word was ever humming in my head , i saw it would only prove the key to more . but i repressed all undue curiosity , if any such has ever filled my breast . i would not ask of any one , who it was that had been glendinning ; where he had lived ; whether , ever any other girl or boy had called him father as i had done . i resolved to hold myself in perfect patience , as somehow mystically certain , that fate would at last disclose to me , of itself , and at the suitable time , whatever fate thought it best for me to know . but now , my brother , i must go aside a little for a moment. -- hand me the guitar . ''
melville	pierre	surprised and rejoiced thus far at the unanticipated newness , and the sweet lucidness and simplicity of isabel 's narrating , as compared with the obscure and marvelous revelations of the night before , and all eager for her to continue her story in the same limpid manner , but remembering into what a wholly tumultuous and unearthly frame of mind the melodies of her guitar had formerly thrown him ; pierre now , in handing the instrument to isabel , could not entirely restrain something like a look of half-regret , accompanied rather strangely with a half-smile of gentle humor . it did not pass unnoticed by his sister , who receiving the guitar , looked up into his face with an expression which would almost have been arch and playful , were it not for the ever-abiding shadows cast from her infinite hair into her unfathomed eyes , and redoubledly shot back again from them .
melville	pierre	`` do not be alarmed , my brother ; and do not smile at me ; i am not going to play the mystery of isabel to thee to-night . draw nearer to me now . hold the light near to me . ''
melville	pierre	so saying she loosened some ivory screws of the guitar , so as to open a peep lengthwise through its interior . `` now hold it thus , my brother ; thus ; and see what thou wilt see ; but wait one instant till i hold the lamp . '' so saying , as pierre held the instrument before him as directed , isabel held the lamp so as to cast its light through the round sounding-hole into the heart of the guitar .
melville	pierre	`` now , pierre , now . '' eagerly pierre did as he was bid ; but somehow felt disappointed , and yet surprised at what he saw . he saw the word _isabel_ , quite legibly but still fadedly gilded upon a part of one side of the interior , where it made a projecting curve .
melville	pierre	`` a very curious place thou hast chosen , isabel , wherein to have the ownership of the guitar engraved . how did ever any person get in there to do it , i should like to know ? ''
melville	pierre	the girl looked surprisedly at him a moment ; then took the instrument from him , and looked into it herself . she put it down , and continued . `` i see , my brother , thou dost not comprehend . when one knows every thing about any object , one is too apt to suppose that the slightest hint will suffice to throw it quite as open to any other person . _i_ did not have the name gilded there , my brother . ''
melville	pierre	`` how ? '' cried pierre . `` the name was gilded there when i first got the guitar , though then i did not know it . the guitar must have been expressly made for some one by the name of isabel ; because the lettering could only have been put there before the guitar was put together . ''
melville	pierre	`` go on -- hurry , '' said pierre . `` yes , one day , after i had owned it a long time , a strange whim came into me . thou know'st that it is not at all uncommon for children to break their dearest playthings in order to gratify a half-crazy curiosity to find out what is in the hidden heart of them . so it is with children , sometimes . and , pierre , i have always been , and feel that i must always continue to be a child , though i should grow to three score years and ten . seized with this sudden whim , i unscrewed the part i showed thee , and peeped in , and saw 'isabel . ' now i have not yet told thee , that from as early a time as i can remember , i have nearly always gone by the name of bell . and at the particular time i now speak of , my knowledge of general and trivial matters was sufficiently advanced to make it quite a familiar thing to me , that bell was often a diminutive for isabella , or isabel . it was therefore no very strange affair , that considering my age , and other connected circumstances at the time , i should have instinctively associated the word isabel , found in the guitar , with my own abbreviated name , and so be led into all sorts of fancyings . they return upon me now . do not speak to me . ''
melville	pierre	she leaned away from him , toward the occasionally illuminated casement , in the same manner as on the previous night , and for a few moments seemed struggling with some wild bewilderment but now she suddenly turned , and fully confronted pierre with all the wonderfulness of her most surprising face .
melville	pierre	`` i am called woman , and thou , man , pierre ; but there is neither man nor woman about it . why should i not speak out to thee ? there is no sex in our immaculateness . pierre , the secret name in the guitar even now thrills me through and through . pierre , think ! think ! oh , canst thou not comprehend ? see it ? -- what i mean , pierre ? the secret name in the guitar thrills me , thrills me , whirls me , whirls me ; so secret , wholly hidden , yet constantly carried about in it ; unseen , unsuspected , always vibrating to the hidden heart-strings -- broken heart-strings ; oh , my mother , my mother , my mother ! ''
melville	pierre	as the wild plaints of isabel pierced into his bosom 's core , they carried with them the first inkling of the extraordinary conceit , so vaguely and shrinkingly hinted at in her till now entirely unintelligible words .
melville	pierre	she lifted her dry burning eyes of long-fringed fire to him . `` pierre -- i have no slightest proof -- but the guitar was _hers_ , i know , i feel it was . say , did i not last night tell thee , how it first sung to me upon the bed , and answered me , without my once touching it ? and how it always sung to me and answered me , and soothed and loved me , -- hark now ; thou shalt hear my mother 's spirit . ''
melville	pierre	she carefully scanned the strings , and tuned them carefully ; then placed the guitar in the casement-bench , and knelt before it ; and in low , sweet , and changefully modulated notes , so barely audible , that pierre bent over to catch them ; breathed the word _mother , mother , mother_ ! there was profound silence for a time ; when suddenly , to the lowest and least audible note of all , the magical untouched guitar responded with a quick spark of melody , which in the following hush , long vibrated and subsidingly tingled through the room ; while to his augmented wonder , he now espied , quivering along the metallic strings of the guitar , some minute scintillations , seemingly caught from the instrument 's close proximity to the occasionally irradiated window .
melville	pierre	the girl still kept kneeling ; but an altogether unwonted expression suddenly overcast her whole countenance . she darted one swift glance at pierre ; and then with a single toss of her hand tumbled her unrestrained locks all over her , so that they tent-wise invested her whole kneeling form close to the floor , and yet swept the floor with their wild redundancy . never saya of limeean girl , at dim mass in st. dominic 's cathedral , so completely muffled the human figure . to pierre , the deep oaken recess of the double-casement , before which isabel was kneeling , seemed now the immediate vestibule of some awful shrine , mystically revealed through the obscurely open window , which ever and anon was still softly illumined by the mild heat-lightnings and ground-lightnings , that wove their wonderfulness without , in the unsearchable air of that ebonly warm and most noiseless summer night .
melville	pierre	some unsubduable word was on pierre 's lip , but a sudden voice from out the veil bade him be silent . `` mother -- mother -- mother ! '' again , after a preluding silence , the guitar as magically responded as before ; the sparks quivered along its strings ; and again pierre felt as in the immediate presence of the spirit .
melville	pierre	`` shall i , mother ? -- art thou ready ? wilt thou tell me ? -- now ? now ? '' these words were lowly and sweetly murmured in the same way with the word _mother_ , being changefully varied in their modulations , till at the last _now_ , the magical guitar again responded ; and the girl swiftly drew it to her beneath her dark tent of hair . in this act , as the long curls swept over the strings of the guitar , the strange sparks -- still quivering there -- caught at those attractive curls ; the entire casement was suddenly and wovenly illumined ; then waned again ; while now , in the succeeding dimness , every downward undulating wave and billow of isabel 's tossed tresses gleamed here and there like a tract of phosphorescent midnight sea ; and , simultaneously , all the four winds of the world of melody broke loose , and again as on the previous night , only in a still more subtile , and wholly inexplicable way , pierre felt himself surrounded by ten thousand sprites and gnomes , and his whole soul was swayed and tossed by supernatural tides ; and again he heard the wondrous , rebounding , chanted words :
melville	pierre	`` mystery ! mystery ! mystery of isabel ! mystery ! mystery ! isabel and mystery ! mystery ! '' iii . almost deprived of consciousness by the spell flung over him by the marvelous girl , pierre unknowingly gazed away from her , as on vacancy ; and when at last stillness had once more fallen upon the room -- all except the stepping -- and he recovered his self-possession , and turned to look where he might now be , he was surprised to see isabel composedly , though avertedly , seated on the bench ; the longer and fuller tresses of her now ungleaming hair flung back , and the guitar quietly leaning in the corner .
melville	pierre	he was about to put some unconsidered question to her , but she half-anticipated it by bidding him , in a low , but nevertheless almost authoritative tone , not to make any allusion to the scene he had just beheld .
melville	pierre	he paused , profoundly thinking to himself , and now felt certain that the entire scene , from the first musical invocation of the guitar , must have unpremeditatedly proceeded from a sudden impulse in the girl , inspired by the peculiar mood into which the preceding conversation , and especially the handling of the guitar under such circumstances , had irresistibly thrown her .
melville	pierre	but that certain something of the preternatural in the scene , of which he could not rid his mind : -- the , so to speak , voluntary and all but intelligent responsiveness of the guitar -- its strangely scintillating strings -- the so suddenly glorified head of isabel ; altogether , these things seemed not at the time entirely produced by customary or natural causes . to pierre 's dilated senses isabel seemed to swim in an electric fluid ; the vivid buckler of her brow seemed as a magnetic plate . now first this night was pierre made aware of what , in the superstitiousness of his rapt enthusiasm , he could not help believing was an extraordinary physical magnetism in isabel . and -- as it were derived from this marvelous quality thus imputed to her -- he now first became vaguely sensible of a certain still more marvelous power in the girl over himself and his most interior thoughts and motions ; -- a power so hovering upon the confines of the invisible world , that it seemed more inclined that way than this ; -- a power which not only seemed irresistibly to draw him toward isabel , but to draw him away from another quarter -- wantonly as it were , and yet quite ignorantly and unintendingly ; and , besides , without respect apparently to any thing ulterior , and yet again , only under cover of drawing him to her . for over all these things , and interfusing itself with the sparkling electricity in which she seemed to swim , was an ever-creeping and condensing haze of ambiguities . often , in after-times with her , did he recall this first magnetic night , and would seem to see that she then had bound him to her by an extraordinary atmospheric spell -- both physical and spiritual -- which henceforth it had become impossible for him to break , but whose full potency he never recognized till long after he had become habituated to its sway . this spell seemed one with that pantheistic master-spell , which eternally locks in mystery and in muteness the universal subject world , and the physical electricalness of isabel seemed reciprocal with the heat-lightnings and the ground-lightnings nigh to which it had first become revealed to pierre . she seemed molded from fire and air , and vivified at some voltaic pile of august thunder-clouds heaped against the sunset .
melville	pierre	the occasional sweet simplicity , and innocence , and humbleness of her story ; her often serene and open aspect ; her deep-seated , but mostly quiet , unobtrusive sadness , and that touchingness of her less unwonted tone and air ; -- these only the more signalized and contrastingly emphasized the profounder , subtler , and more mystic part of her . especially did pierre feel this , when after another silent interval , she now proceeded with her story in a manner so gently confiding , so entirely artless , so almost peasant-like in its simplicity , and dealing in some details so little sublimated in themselves , that it seemed well nigh impossible that this unassuming maid should be the same dark , regal being who had but just now bade pierre be silent in so imperious a tone , and around whose wondrous temples the strange electric glory had been playing . yet not very long did she now thus innocently proceed , ere , at times , some fainter flashes of her electricalness came from her , but only to be followed by such melting , human , and most feminine traits as brought all his soft , enthusiast tears into the sympathetic but still unshedding eyes of pierre .
melville	pierre	iv . `` thou rememberest , my brother , my telling thee last night , how the -- the -- thou knowest what i mean -- _that , there_ '' -- avertedly pointing to the guitar ; `` thou rememberest how it came into my possession . but perhaps i did not tell thee , that the pedler said he had got it in barter from the servants of a great house some distance from the place where i was then residing . ''
melville	pierre	pierre signed his acquiescence , and isabel proceeded : `` now , at long though stated intervals , that man passed the farm-house in his trading route between the small towns and villages . when i discovered the gilding in the guitar , i kept watch for him ; for though i truly felt persuaded that fate had the dispensing of her own secrets in her own good time ; yet i also felt persuaded that in some cases fate drops us one little hint , leaving our own minds to follow it up , so that we of ourselves may come to the grand secret in reserve . so i kept diligent watch for him ; and the next time he stopped , without permitting him at all to guess my motives , i contrived to steal out of him what great house it was from which the guitar had come . and , my brother , it was the mansion of saddle meadows . ''
melville	pierre	pierre started , and the girl went on : `` yes , my brother , saddle meadows ; 'old general glendinning 's place , ' he said ; 'but the old hero 's long dead and gone now ; and -- the more 's the pity -- so is the young general , his son , dead and gone ; but then there is a still younger grandson general left ; that family always keep the title and the name a-going ; yes , even to the surname , -- pierre . pierre glendinning was the white-haired old general 's name , who fought in the old french and indian wars ; and pierre glendinning is his young great-grandson 's name . ' thou may'st well look at me so , my brother ; -- yes , he meant thee , _thee_ , my brother . ''
melville	pierre	`` but the guitar -- the guitar ! '' -- cried pierre -- '' how came the guitar openly at saddle meadows , and how came it to be bartered away by servants ? tell me that , isabel ! '' `` do not put such impetuous questions to me , pierre ; else thou mayst recall the old -- may be , it is the evil spell upon me . i can not precisely and knowingly answer thee . i could surmise ; but what are surmises worth ? oh , pierre , better , a million times , and far sweeter are mysteries than surmises : though the mystery be unfathomable , it is still the unfathomableness of fullness ; but the surmise , that is but shallow and unmeaning emptiness . ''
melville	pierre	`` but this is the most inexplicable point of all . tell me , isabel ; surely thou must have thought something about this thing . '' `` much , pierre , very much ; but only about the mystery of it -- nothing more . could i , i would not now be fully told , how the guitar came to be at saddle meadows , and came to be bartered away by the servants of saddle meadows . enough , that it found me out , and came to me , and spoke and sung to me , and soothed me , and has been every thing to me . ''
melville	pierre	she paused a moment ; while vaguely to his secret self pierre revolved these strange revealings ; but now he was all attention again as isabel resumed . `` i now held in my mind 's hand the clew , my brother . but i did not immediately follow it further up . sufficient to me in my loneliness was the knowledge , that i now knew where my father 's family was to be found . as yet not the slightest intention of ever disclosing myself to them , had entered my mind . and assured as i was , that for obvious reasons , none of his surviving relatives could possibly know me , even if they saw me , for what i really was , i felt entire security in the event of encountering any of them by chance . but my unavoidable displacements and migrations from one house to another , at last brought me within twelve miles of saddle meadows . i began to feel an increasing longing in me ; but side by side with it , a new-born and competing pride , -- yes , pride , pierre . do my eyes flash ? they belie me , if they do not . but it is no common pride , pierre ; for what has isabel to be proud of in this world ? it is the pride of -- of -- a too , too longing , loving heart , pierre -- the pride of lasting suffering and grief , my brother ! yes , i conquered the great longing with the still more powerful pride , pierre ; and so i would not now be here , in this room , -- nor wouldst thou ever have received any line from me ; nor , in all worldly probability , ever so much as heard of her who is called isabel banford , had it not been for my hearing that at walter ulver 's , only three miles from the mansion of saddle meadows , poor bell would find people kind enough to give her wages for her work . feel my hand , my brother . ''
melville	pierre	`` dear divine girl , my own exalted isabel ! '' cried pierre , catching the offered hand with ungovernable emotion , `` how most unbeseeming , that this strange hardness , and this still stranger littleness should be united in any human hand . but hard and small , it by an opposite analogy hints of the soft capacious heart that made the hand so hard with heavenly submission to thy most undeserved and martyred lot . would , isabel , that these my kisses on the hand , were on the heart itself , and dropt the seeds of eternal joy and comfort there . ''
melville	pierre	he leaped to his feet , and stood before her with such warm , god-like majesty of love and tenderness , that the girl gazed up at him as though he were the one benignant star in all her general night .
melville	pierre	`` isabel , '' cried pierre , `` i stand the sweet penance in my father 's stead , thou , in thy mother 's . by our earthly acts we shall redeemingly bless both their eternal lots ; we will love with the pure and perfect love of angel to an angel . if ever i fall from thee , dear isabel , may pierre fall from himself ; fall back forever into vacant nothingness and night ! ''
melville	pierre	`` my brother , my brother , speak not so to me ; it is too much ; unused to any love ere now , thine , so heavenly and immense , falls crushing on me ! such love is almost hard to bear as hate . be still ; do not speak to me . ''
melville	pierre	they were both silent for a time ; when she went on . `` yes , my brother , fate had now brought me within three miles of thee ; and -- but shall i go straight on , and tell thee all , pierre ? all ? every thing ? art thou of such divineness , that i may speak straight on , in all my thoughts , heedless whither they may flow , or what things they may float to me ? ''
melville	pierre	`` straight on , and fearlessly , '' said pierre . `` by chance i saw thy mother , pierre , and under such circumstances that i _knew_ her to be thy mother ; and -- but shall i go on ? ''
melville	pierre	`` straight on , my isabel ; thou didst see my mother -- well ? '' `` and when i saw her , though i spake not to her , nor she to me , yet straightway my heart knew that she would love me not . ''
melville	pierre	`` thy heart spake true , '' muttered pierre to himself ; `` go on . '' `` i re-swore an oath never to reveal myself to thy mother . '' `` oath well sworn , '' again he muttered ; `` go on . '' `` but i saw _thee_ , pierre ; and , more than ever filled my mother toward thy father , pierre , then upheaved in me . straightway i knew that if ever i should come to be made known to thee , then thy own generous love would open itself to me . ''
melville	pierre	`` again thy heart spake true , '' he murmured ; `` go on -- and didst thou re-swear again ? '' `` no , pierre ; but yes , i did . i swore that thou wert my brother ; with love and pride i swore , that young and noble pierre glendinning was my brother ! ''
melville	pierre	`` and only that ? '' `` nothing more , pierre ; not to thee even , did i ever think to reveal myself . '' `` how then ? thou _art_ revealed to me . '' `` yes ; but the great god did it , pierre -- not poor bell . listen .
melville	pierre	`` i felt very dreary here ; poor , dear delly -- thou must have heard something of her story -- a most sorrowful house , pierre . hark ! that is her seldom-pausing pacing thou hearest from the floor above . so she keeps ever pacing , pacing , pacing ; in her track , all thread-bare , pierre , is her chamber-rug . her father will not look upon her ; her mother , she hath cursed her to her face . out of yon chamber , pierre , delly hath not slept , for now four weeks and more ; nor ever hath she once laid upon her bed ; it was last made up five weeks ago ; but paces , paces , paces , all through the night , till after twelve ; and then sits vacant in her chair . often i would go to her to comfort her ; but she says , 'nay , nay , nay , ' to me through the door ; says 'nay , nay , nay , ' and only nay to me , through the bolted door ; bolted three weeks ago -- when i by cunning arts stole her dead baby from her , and with these fingers , alone , by night , scooped out a hollow , and , seconding heaven 's own charitable stroke , buried that sweet , wee symbol of her not unpardonable shame far from the ruthless foot of man -- yes , bolted three weeks ago , not once unbolted since ; her food i must thrust through the little window in her closet . pierre , hardly these two handfuls has she eaten in a week . ''
melville	pierre	`` curses , wasp-like , cohere on that villain , ned , and sting him to his death ! '' cried pierre , smit by this most piteous tale . `` what can be done for her , sweet isabel ; can pierre do aught ? ''
melville	pierre	`` if thou or i do not , then the ever-hospitable grave will prove her quick refuge , pierre . father and mother both , are worse than dead and gone to her . they would have turned her forth , i think , but for my own poor petitionings , unceasing in her behalf ! ''
melville	pierre	pierre 's deep concern now gave place to a momentary look of benevolent intelligence . `` isabel , a thought of benefit to delly has just entered me ; but i am still uncertain how best it may be acted on . resolved i am though to succor her . do thou still hold her here yet awhile , by thy sweet petitionings , till my further plans are more matured . now run on with thy story , and so divert me from the pacing ; -- her every step steps in my soul . ''
melville	pierre	`` thy noble heart hath many chambers , pierre ; the records of thy wealth , i see , are not bound up in the one poor book of isabel , my brother . thou art a visible token , pierre , of the invisible angel-hoods , which in our darker hours we do sometimes distrust . the gospel of thy acts goes very far , my brother . were all men like to thee , then were there no men at all , -- mankind extinct in seraphim ! ''
melville	pierre	`` praises are for the base , my sister , cunningly to entice them to fair virtue by our ignorings of the ill in them , and our imputings of the good not theirs . so make not my head to hang , sweet isabel . praise me not . go on now with thy tale . ''
melville	pierre	`` i have said to thee , my brother , how most dreary i found it here , and from the first . wonted all my life to sadness -- if it be such -- still , this house hath such acuteness in its general grief , such hopelessness and despair of any slightest remedy -- that even poor bell could scarce abide it always , without some little going forth into contrasting scenes . so i went forth into the places of delight , only that i might return more braced to minister in the haunts of woe . for continual unchanging residence therein , doth but bring on woe 's stupor , and make us as dead . so i went forth betimes ; visiting the neighboring cottages ; where there were chattering children , and no one place vacant at the cheerful board . thus at last i chanced to hear of the sewing circle to be held at the miss pennies ' ; and how that they were anxious to press into their kind charity all the maidens of the country round . in various cottages , i was besought to join ; and they at length persuaded me ; not that i was naturally loth to it , and needed such entreaties ; but at first i felt great fear , lest at such a scene i might closely encounter some of the glendinnings ; and that thought was then namelessly repulsive to me . but by stealthy inquiries i learned , that the lady of the manorial-house would not be present ; -- it proved deceptive information ; -- but i went ; and all the rest thou knowest . ''
melville	pierre	`` i do , sweet isabel , but thou must tell it over to me ; and all thy emotions there . '' v. `` though but one day hath passed , my brother , since we first met in life , yet thou hast that heavenly magnet in thee , which draws all my soul 's interior to thee . i will go on. -- having to wait for a neighbor 's wagon , i arrived but late at the sewing circle . when i entered , the two joined rooms were very full . with the farmer 's girls , our neighbors , i passed along to the further corner , where thou didst see me ; and as i went , some heads were turned , and some whisperings i heard , of -- 'she 's the new help at poor walter ulver 's -- the strange girl they 've got -- she thinks herself 'mazing pretty , i 'll be bound ; -- but nobody knows her -- oh , how demure ! -- but not over-good , i guess ; -- i would n't be her , not i -- mayhap she 's some other ruined delly , run away ; -- minx ! ' it was the first time poor bell had ever mixed in such a general crowded company ; and knowing little or nothing of such things , i had thought , that the meeting being for charity 's sweet sake , uncharity could find no harbor there ; but no doubt it was mere thoughtlessness , not malice in them . still , it made my heart ache in me sadly ; for then i very keenly felt the dread suspiciousness , in which a strange and lonely grief invests itself to common eyes ; as if grief itself were not enough , nor innocence any armor to us , but despite must also come , and icy infamy ! miserable returnings then i had -- even in the midst of bright-budding girls and full-blown women -- miserable returnings then i had of the feeling , the bewildering feeling of the inhumanities i spoke of in my earlier story . but pierre , blessed pierre , do not look so sadly and half-reproachfully upon me . lone and lost though i have been , i love my kind ; and charitably and intelligently pity them , who uncharitably and unintelligently do me despite . and thou , _thou_ , blessed brother , hath glorified many somber places in my soul , and taught me once for all to know , that my kind are capable of things which would be glorious in angels . so look away from me , dear pierre , till thou hast taught thine eyes more wonted glances . ''
melville	pierre	`` they are vile falsifying telegraphs of me , then , sweet isabel . what my look was i can not tell , but my heart was only dark with ill-restrained upbraidings against heaven that could unrelentingly see such innocence as thine so suffer . go on with thy too-touching tale . ''
melville	pierre	`` quietly i sat there sewing , not brave enough to look up at all , and thanking my good star , that had led me to so concealed a nook behind the rest : quietly i sat there , sewing on a flannel shirt , and with each stitch praying god , that whatever heart it might be folded over , the flannel might hold it truly warm ; and keep out the wide-world-coldness which i felt myself ; and which no flannel , or thickest fur , or any fire then could keep off from me ; quietly i sat there sewing , when i heard the announcing words -- oh , how deep and ineffaceably engraved they are ! -- 'ah , dames , dames , madame glendinning , -- master pierre glendinning . ' instantly , my sharp needle went through my side and stitched my heart ; the flannel dropt from my hand ; thou heard'st my shriek . but the good people bore me still nearer to the casement close at hand , and threw it open wide ; and god 's own breath breathed on me ; and i rallied ; and said it was some merest passing fit -- 't was quite over now -- i was used to it -- they had my heart 's best thanks -- but would they now only leave me to myself , it were best for me ; -- i would go on and sew . and thus it came and passed away ; and again i sat sewing on the flannel , hoping either that the unanticipated persons would soon depart , or else that some spirit would catch me away from there ; i sat sewing on -- till , pierre ! pierre ! -- without looking up -- for that i dared not do at any time that evening -- only once -- without looking up , or knowing aught but the flannel on my knee , and the needle in my heart , i felt , -- pierre , _felt_ -- a glance of magnetic meaning on me . long , i , shrinking , sideways turned to meet it , but could not ; till some helping spirit seized me , and all my soul looked up at thee in my full-fronting face . it was enough . fate was in that moment . all the loneliness of my life , all the choked longings of my soul , now poured over me . i could not away from them . then first i felt the complete deplorableness of my state ; that while thou , my brother , had a mother , and troops of aunts and cousins , and plentiful friends in city and in country -- i , i , isabel , thy own father 's daughter , was thrust out of all hearts ' gates , and shivered in the winter way . but this was but the least . not poor bell can tell thee all the feelings of poor bell , or what feelings she felt first . it was all one whirl of old and new bewilderings , mixed and slanted with a driving madness . but it was most the sweet , inquisitive , kindly interested aspect of thy face , -- so strangely like thy father 's , too -- the one only being that i first did love -- it was that which most stirred the distracting storm in me ; most charged me with the immense longings for some one of my blood to know me , and to own me , though but once , and then away . oh , my dear brother -- pierre ! pierre ! -- could'st thou take out my heart , and look at it in thy hand , then thou would'st find it all over written , this way and that , and crossed again , and yet again , with continual lines of longings , that found no end but in suddenly calling thee . call him ! call him ! he will come ! -- so cried my heart to me ; so cried the leaves and stars to me , as i that night went home . but pride rose up -- the very pride in my own longings , -- and as one arm pulled , the other held . so i stood still , and called thee not . but fate will be fate , and it was fated . once having met thy fixed regardful glance ; once having seen the full angelicalness in thee , my whole soul was undone by thee ; my whole pride was cut off at the root , and soon showed a blighting in the bud ; which spread deep into my whole being , till i knew , that utterly decay and die away i must , unless pride let me go , and i , with the one little trumpet of a pen , blew my heart 's shrillest blast , and called dear pierre to me . my soul was full ; and as my beseeching ink went tracing o'er the page , my tears contributed their mite , and made a strange alloy . how blest i felt that my so bitterly tear-mingled ink -- that last depth of my anguish -- would never be visibly known to thee , but the tears would dry upon the page , and all be fair again , ere the so submerged-freighted letter should meet thine eye .
melville	pierre	`` ah , there thou wast deceived , poor isabel , '' cried pierre impulsively ; `` thy tears dried not fair , but dried red , almost like blood ; and nothing so much moved my inmost soul as that tragic sight . ''
melville	pierre	`` how ? how ? pierre , my brother ? dried they red ? oh , horrible ! enchantment ! most undreamed of ! '' `` nay , the ink -- the ink ! something chemic in it changed thy real tears to seeming blood ; -- only that , my sister . ''
melville	pierre	`` oh pierre ! thus wonderfully is it -- seems to me -- that our own hearts do not ever know the extremity of their own sufferings ; sometimes we bleed blood , when we think it only water . of our sufferings , as of our talents , others sometimes are the better judges . but stop me ! force me backward to my story ! yet methinks that now thou knowest all ; -- no , not entirely all . thou dost not know what planned and winnowed motive i did have in writing thee ; nor does poor bell know that ; for poor bell was too delirious to have planned and winnowed motives then . the impulse in me called thee , not poor bell . god called thee , pierre , not poor bell . even now , when i have passed one night after seeing thee , and hearkening to all thy full love and graciousness ; even now , i stand as one amazed , and feel not what may be coming to me , or what will now befall me , from having so rashly claimed thee for mine . pierre , now , _now_ , this instant a vague anguish fills me . tell me , by loving me , by owning me , publicly or secretly , -- tell me , doth it involve any vital hurt to thee ? speak without reserve ; speak honestly ; as i do to thee ! speak now , pierre , and tell me all ! ''
melville	pierre	`` is love a harm ? can truth betray to pain ? sweet isabel , how can hurt come in the path to god ? now , when i know thee all , now did i forget thee , fail to acknowledge thee , and love thee before the wide world 's whole brazen width -- could i do that ; then might'st thou ask thy question reasonably and say -- tell me , pierre , does not the suffocating in thee of poor bell 's holy claims , does not that involve for thee unending misery ? and my truthful soul would echo -- unending misery ! nay , nay , nay . thou art my sister and i am thy brother ; and that part of the world which knows me , shall acknowledge thee ; or by heaven i will crush the disdainful world down on its knees to thee , my sweet isabel ! ''
melville	pierre	`` the menacings in thy eyes are dear delights to me ; i grow up with thy own glorious stature ; and in thee , my brother , i see god 's indignant embassador to me , saying -- up , up , isabel , and take no terms from the common world , but do thou make terms to it , and grind thy fierce rights out of it ! thy catching nobleness unsexes me , my brother ; and now i know that in her most exalted moment , then woman no more feels the twin-born softness of her breasts , but feels chain-armor palpitating there ! ''
melville	pierre	her changed attitude of beautiful audacity ; her long scornful hair , that trailed out a disheveled banner ; her wonderful transfigured eyes , in which some meteors seemed playing up ; all this now seemed to pierre the work of an invisible enchanter . transformed she stood before him ; and pierre , bowing low over to her , owned that irrespective , darting majesty of humanity , which can be majestical and menacing in woman as in man .
melville	pierre	but her gentler sex returned to isabel at last ; and she sat silent in the casement 's niche , looking out upon the soft ground-lightnings of the electric summer night . vi . sadly smiling , pierre broke the pause .
melville	pierre	`` my sister , thou art so rich , that thou must do me alms ; i am very hungry ; i have forgotten to eat since breakfast ; -- and now thou shalt bring me bread and a cup of water , isabel , ere i go forth from thee . last night i went rummaging in a pantry , like a bake-house burglar ; but to-night thou and i must sup together , isabel ; for as we may henceforth live together , let us begin forthwith to eat in company . ''
melville	pierre	isabel looked up at him , with sudden and deep emotion , then all acquiescing sweetness , and silently left the room . as she returned , pierre , casting his eyes toward the ceiling , said -- '' she is quiet now , the pacing hath entirely ceased . ''
melville	pierre	`` not the beating , tho ' ; her foot hath paused , not her unceasing heart . my brother , she is not quiet now ; quiet for her hath gone ; so that the pivoted stillness of this night is yet a noisy madness to her . ''
melville	pierre	`` give me pen or pencil , and some paper , isabel . '' she laid down her loaf , and plate , and knife , and brought him pen , and ink , and paper . pierre took the pen .
melville	pierre	`` was this the one , dear isabel ? '' `` it is the one , my brother ; none other is in this poor cot . '' he gazed at it intensely . then turning to the table , steadily wrote the following note :
melville	pierre	`` for delly ulver : with the deep and true regard and sympathy of pierre glendinning . `` thy sad story -- partly known before -- hath now more fully come to me , from one who sincerely feels for thee , and who hath imparted her own sincerity to me . thou desirest to quit this neighborhood , and be somewhere at peace , and find some secluded employ fitted to thy sex and age . with this , i now willingly charge myself , and insure it to thee , so far as my utmost ability can go . therefore -- if consolation be not wholly spurned by thy great grief , which too often happens , though it be but grief 's great folly so to feel -- therefore , two true friends of thine do here beseech thee to take some little heart to thee , and bethink thee , that all thy life is not yet lived ; that time hath surest healing in his continuous balm . be patient yet a little while , till thy future lot be disposed for thee , through our best help ; and so , know me and isabel thy earnest friends and true-hearted lovers . ''
melville	pierre	he handed the note to isabel . she read it silently , and put it down , and spread her two hands over him , and with one motion lifted her eyes toward delly and toward god .
melville	pierre	`` thou think'st it will not pain her to receive the note , isabel ? thou know'st best . i thought , that ere our help do really reach her , some promise of it now might prove slight comfort . but keep it , and do as thou think'st best . ''
melville	pierre	`` then straightway will i give it her , my brother , '' said isabel , quitting him . an infixing stillness , now thrust a long rivet through the night , and fast nailed it to that side of the world . and alone again in such an hour , pierre could not but listen . he heard isabel 's step on the stair ; then it approached him from above ; then he heard a gentle knock , and thought he heard a rustling , as of paper slid over a threshold underneath a door . then another advancing and opposite step tremblingly met isabel 's ; and then both steps stepped from each other , and soon isabel came back to him .
melville	pierre	`` thou did'st knock , and slide it underneath the door ? '' `` yes , and she hath it now . hark ! a sobbing ! thank god , long arid grief hath found a tear at last . pity , sympathy hath done this. -- pierre , for thy dear deed thou art already sainted , ere thou be dead . ''
melville	pierre	`` do saints hunger , isabel ? '' said pierre , striving to call her away from this . `` come , give me the loaf ; but no , thou shalt help me , my sister. -- thank thee ; -- this is twice over the bread of sweetness. -- is this of thine own making , isabel ? ''
melville	pierre	`` my own making , my brother . '' `` give me the cup ; hand it me with thine own hand . so : -- isabel , my heart and soul are now full of deepest reverence ; yet i do dare to call this the real sacrament of the supper. -- eat with me . ''
melville	pierre	they eat together without a single word ; and without a single word , pierre rose , and kissed her pure and spotless brow , and without a single word departed from the place .
melville	pierre	vii . we know not pierre glendinning 's thoughts as he gained the village and passed on beneath its often shrouding trees , and saw no light from man , and heard no sound from man , but only , by intervals , saw at his feet the soft ground-lightnings , snake-like , playing in and out among the blades of grass ; and between the trees , caught the far dim light from heaven , and heard the far wide general hum of the sleeping but still breathing earth .
melville	pierre	he paused before a detached and pleasant house , with much shrubbery about it . he mounted the portico and knocked distinctly there , just as the village clock struck one . he knocked , but no answer came . he knocked again , and soon he heard a sash thrown up in the second story , and an astonished voice inquired who was there ?
melville	pierre	`` it is pierre glendinning , and he desires an instant interview with the reverend mr . falsgrave . '' `` do i hear right ? -- in heaven 's name , what is the matter , young gentleman ? '' `` every thing is the matter ; the whole world is the matter . will you admit me , sir ? ''
melville	pierre	`` certainly -- but i beseech thee -- nay , stay , i will admit thee . '' in quicker time than could have been anticipated , the door was opened to pierre by mr. falsgrave in person , holding a candle , and invested in his very becoming student 's wrapper of scotch plaid .
melville	pierre	`` for heaven 's sake , what is the matter , mr . glendinning ? '' `` heaven and earth is the matter , sir ! shall we go up to the study ? '' `` certainly , but -- but -- '' `` well , let us proceed , then . ''
melville	pierre	they went up-stairs , and soon found themselves in the clergyman 's retreat , and both sat down ; the amazed host still holding the candle in his hand , and intently eying pierre , with an apprehensive aspect .
melville	pierre	`` thou art a man of god , sir , i believe . '' `` i ? i ? i ? upon my word , mr . glendinning ! '' `` yes , sir , the world calls thee a man of god . now , what hast thou , the man of god , decided , with my mother , concerning delly ulver ? ''
melville	pierre	`` delly ulver ! why , why -- what can this madness mean ? '' `` it means , sir , what have thou and my mother decided concerning delly ulver . '' `` she ? -- delly ulver ? she is to depart the neighborhood ; why , her own parents want her not . ''
melville	pierre	`` _how_ is she to depart ? _who_ is to take her ? art _thou_ to take her ? _where_ is she to go ? _who_ has food for her ? _what_ is to keep her from the pollution to which such as she are every day driven to contribute , by the detestable uncharitableness and heartlessness of the world ? ''
melville	pierre	`` mr. glendinning , '' said the clergyman , now somewhat calmly putting down the candle , and folding himself with dignity in his gown ; `` mr. glendinning , i will not now make any mention of my natural astonishment at this most unusual call , and the most extraordinary time of it . thou hast sought information upon a certain point , and i have given it to thee , to the best of my knowledge . all thy after and incidental questions , i choose to have no answer for . i will be most happy to see thee at any other time , but for the present thou must excuse my presence . good-night , sir . ''
melville	pierre	but pierre sat entirely still , and the clergyman could not but remain standing still . `` i perfectly comprehend the whole , sir . delly ulver , then , is to be driven out to starve or rot ; and this , too , by the acquiescence of a man of god . mr. falsgrave , the subject of delly , deeply interesting as it is to me , is only the preface to another , still more interesting to me , and concerning which i once cherished some slight hope that thou wouldst have been able , in thy christian character , to sincerely and honestly counsel me . but a hint from heaven assures me now , that thou hast no earnest and world-disdaining counsel for me . i must seek it direct from god himself , whom , i now know , never delegates his holiest admonishings . but i do not blame thee ; i think i begin to see how thy profession is unavoidably entangled by all fleshly alliances , and can not move with godly freedom in a world of benefices . i am more sorry than indignant . pardon me for my most uncivil call , and know me as not thy enemy . good-night , sir . ''
melville	pierre	book ix . more light , and the gloom of that light . more gloom , and the light of that gloom . i . in those hyperborean regions , to which enthusiastic truth , and earnestness , and independence , will invariably lead a mind fitted by nature for profound and fearless thought , all objects are seen in a dubious , uncertain , and refracting light . viewed through that rarefied atmosphere the most immemorially admitted maxims of men begin to slide and fluctuate , and finally become wholly inverted ; the very heavens themselves being not innocent of producing this confounding effect , since it is mostly in the heavens themselves that these wonderful mirages are exhibited .
melville	pierre	but the example of many minds forever lost , like undiscoverable arctic explorers , amid those treacherous regions , warns us entirely away from them ; and we learn that it is not for man to follow the trail of truth too far , since by so doing he entirely loses the directing compass of his mind ; for arrived at the pole , to whose barrenness only it points , there , the needle indifferently respects all points of the horizon alike .
melville	pierre	but even the less distant regions of thought are not without their singular introversions . hardly any sincere man of ordinary reflective powers , and accustomed to exercise them at all , but must have been independently struck by the thought , that , after all , what is so enthusiastically applauded as the march of mind , -- meaning the inroads of truth into error -- which has ever been regarded by hopeful persons as the one fundamental thing most earnestly to be prayed for as the greatest possible catholic blessing to the world ; -- almost every thinking man must have been some time or other struck with the idea , that , in certain respects , a tremendous mistake may be lurking here , since all the world does never gregariously advance to truth , but only here and there some of its individuals do ; and by advancing , leave the rest behind ; cutting themselves forever adrift from their sympathy , and making themselves always liable to be regarded with distrust , dislike , and often , downright -- though , ofttimes , concealed -- fear and hate . what wonder , then , that those advanced minds , which in spite of advance , happen still to remain , for the time , ill-regulated , should now and then be goaded into turning round in acts of wanton aggression upon sentiments and opinions now forever left in their rear . certain it is , that in their earlier stages of advance , especially in youthful minds , as yet untranquilized by long habituation to the world as it inevitably and eternally is ; this aggressiveness is almost invariably manifested , and as invariably afterward deplored by themselves .
melville	pierre	that amazing shock of practical truth , which in the compass of a very few days and hours had not so much advanced , as magically transplanted the youthful mind of pierre far beyond all common discernments ; it had not been entirely unattended by the lamentable rearward aggressiveness we have endeavored to portray above . yielding to that unwarrantable mood , he had invaded the profound midnight slumbers of the reverend mr. falsgrave , and most discourteously made war upon that really amiable and estimable person . but as through the strange force of circumstances his advance in insight had been so surprisingly rapid , so also was now his advance in some sort of wisdom , in charitableness ; and his concluding words to mr. falsgrave , sufficiently evinced that already , ere quitting that gentleman 's study , he had begun to repent his ever entering it on such a mission .
melville	pierre	and as he now walked on in the profound meditations induced by the hour ; and as all that was in him stirred to and fro , intensely agitated by the ever-creative fire of enthusiastic earnestness , he became fully alive to many palliating considerations , which had they previously occurred to him would have peremptorily forbidden his impulsive intrusion upon the respectable clergyman .
melville	pierre	but it is through the malice of this earthly air , that only by being guilty of folly does mortal man in many cases arrive at the perception of sense . a thought which should forever free us from hasty imprecations upon our ever-recurring intervals of folly ; since though folly be our teacher , sense is the lesson she teaches ; since if folly wholly depart from us , further sense will be her companion in the flight , and we will be left standing midway in wisdom . for it is only the miraculous vanity of man which ever persuades him , that even for the most richly gifted mind , there ever arrives an earthly period , where it can truly say to itself , i have come to the ultimate of human speculative knowledge ; hereafter , at this present point i will abide . sudden onsets of new truth will assail him , and over-turn him as the tartars did china ; for there is no china wall that man can build in his soul , which shall permanently stay the irruptions of those barbarous hordes which truth ever nourishes in the loins of her frozen , yet teeming north ; so that the empire of human knowledge can never be lasting in any one dynasty , since truth still gives new emperors to the earth .
melville	pierre	but the thoughts we here indite as pierre 's are to be very carefully discriminated from those we indite concerning him . ignorant at this time of the ideas concerning the reciprocity and partnership of folly and sense , in contributing to the mental and moral growth of the mind ; pierre keenly upbraided his thoughtlessness , and began to stagger in his soul ; as distrustful of that radical change in his general sentiments , which had thus hurried him into a glaring impropriety and folly ; as distrustful of himself , the most wretched distrust of all . but this last distrust was not of the heart ; for heaven itself , so he felt , had sanctified that with its blessing ; but it was the distrust of his intellect , which in undisciplinedly espousing the manly enthusiast cause of his heart , seemed to cast a reproach upon that cause itself .
melville	pierre	but though evermore hath the earnest heart an eventual balm for the most deplorable error of the head ; yet in the interval small alleviation is to be had , and the whole man droops into nameless melancholy . then it seems as though the most magnanimous and virtuous resolutions were only intended for fine spiritual emotions , not as mere preludes to their bodily translation into acts ; since in essaying their embodiment , we have but proved ourselves miserable bunglers , and thereupon taken ignominious shame to ourselves . then , too , the never-entirely repulsed hosts of commonness , and conventionalness , and worldly prudent-mindedness return to the charge ; press hard on the faltering soul ; and with inhuman hootings deride all its nobleness as mere eccentricity , which further wisdom and experience shall assuredly cure . the man is as seized by arms and legs , and convulsively pulled either way by his own indecisions and doubts . blackness advances her banner over this cruel altercation , and he droops and swoons beneath its folds .
melville	pierre	it was precisely in this mood of mind that , at about two in the morning , pierre , with a hanging head , now crossed the private threshold of the mansion of saddle meadows .
melville	pierre	ii . in the profoundly silent heart of a house full of sleeping serving-men and maids , pierre now sat in his chamber before his accustomed round table , still tossed with the books and the papers which , three days before , he had abruptly left , for a sudden and more absorbing object . uppermost and most conspicuous among the books were the inferno of dante , and the hamlet of shakspeare .
melville	pierre	his mind was wandering and vague ; his arm wandered and was vague . soon he found the open inferno in his hand , and his eye met the following lines , allegorically overscribed within the arch of the outgoings of the womb of human life :
melville	pierre	`` through me you pass into the city of woe ; through me you pass into eternal pain ; through me , among the people lost for aye . * * * * *
melville	pierre	all hope abandon , ye who enter here . '' he dropped the fatal volume from his hand ; he dropped his fated head upon his chest . his mind was wandering and vague ; his arm wandered and was vague . some moments passed , and he found the open hamlet in his hand , and his eyes met the following lines :
melville	pierre	`` the time is out of joint ; -- oh cursed spite , that ever i was born to set it right ! '' he dropped the too true volume from his hand ; his petrifying heart dropped hollowly within him , as a pebble down carrisbrook well .
melville	pierre	iii . the man dante alighieri received unforgivable affronts and insults from the world ; and the poet dante alighieri bequeathed his immortal curse to it , in the sublime malediction of the inferno . the fiery tongue whose political forkings lost him the solacements of this world , found its malicious counterpart in that muse of fire , which would forever bar the vast bulk of mankind from all solacement in the worlds to come . fortunately for the felicity of the dilletante in literature , the horrible allegorical meanings of the inferno , lie not on the surface ; but unfortunately for the earnest and youthful piercers into truth and reality , those horrible meanings , when first discovered , infuse their poison into a spot previously unprovided with that sovereign antidote of a sense of uncapitulatable security , which is only the possession of the furthest advanced and profoundest souls .
melville	pierre	judge ye , then , ye judicious , the mood of pierre , so far as the passage in dante touched him . if among the deeper significances of its pervading indefiniteness , which significances are wisely hidden from all but the rarest adepts , the pregnant tragedy of hamlet convey any one particular moral at all fitted to the ordinary uses of man , it is this : -- that all meditation is worthless , unless it prompt to action ; that it is not for man to stand shilly-shallying amid the conflicting invasions of surrounding impulses ; that in the earliest instant of conviction , the roused man must strike , and , if possible , with the precision and the force of the lightning-bolt .
melville	pierre	pierre had always been an admiring reader of hamlet ; but neither his age nor his mental experience thus far , had qualified him either to catch initiating glimpses into the hopeless gloom of its interior meaning , or to draw from the general story those superficial and purely incidental lessons , wherein the painstaking moralist so complacently expatiates .
melville	pierre	the intensest light of reason and revelation combined , can not shed such blazonings upon the deeper truths in man , as will sometimes proceed from his own profoundest gloom . utter darkness is then his light , and cat-like he distinctly sees all objects through a medium which is mere blindness to common vision . wherefore have gloom and grief been celebrated of old as the selectest chamberlains to knowledge ? wherefore is it , that not to know gloom and grief is not to know aught that an heroic man should learn ?
melville	pierre	by the light of that gloom , pierre now turned over the soul of hamlet in his hand . he knew not -- at least , felt not -- then , that hamlet , though a thing of life , was , after all , but a thing of breath , evoked by the wanton magic of a creative hand , and as wantonly dismissed at last into endless halls of hell and night .
melville	pierre	it is the not impartially bestowed privilege of the more final insights , that at the same moment they reveal the depths , they do , sometimes , also reveal -- though by no means so distinctly -- some answering heights . but when only midway down the gulf , its crags wholly conceal the upper vaults , and the wanderer thinks it all one gulf of downward dark .
melville	pierre	judge ye , then , ye judicious , the mood of pierre , so far as the passage in hamlet touched him . iv . torn into a hundred shreds the printed pages of hell and hamlet lay at his feet , which trampled them , while their vacant covers mocked him with their idle titles . dante had made him fierce , and hamlet had insinuated that there was none to strike . dante had taught him that he had bitter cause of quarrel ; hamlet taunted him with faltering in the fight . now he began to curse anew his fate , for now he began to see that after all he had been finely juggling with himself , and postponing with himself , and in meditative sentimentalities wasting the moments consecrated to instant action .
melville	pierre	eight-and-forty hours and more had passed . was isabel acknowledged ? had she yet hung on his public arm ? who knew yet of isabel but pierre ? like a skulking coward he had gone prowling in the woods by day , and like a skulking coward he had stolen to her haunt by night ! like a thief he had sat and stammered and turned pale before his mother , and in the cause of holy right , permitted a woman to grow tall and hector over him ! ah ! easy for man to think like a hero ; but hard for man to act like one . all imaginable audacities readily enter into the soul ; few come boldly forth from it .
melville	pierre	did he , or did he not vitally mean to do this thing ? was the immense stuff to do it his , or was it not his ? why defer ? why put off ? what was there to be gained by deferring and putting off ? his resolution had been taken , why was it not executed ? what more was there to learn ? what more which was essential to the public acknowledgment of isabel , had remained to be learned , after his first glance at her first letter ? had doubts of her identity come over him to stay him ? -- none at all . against the wall of the thick darkness of the mystery of isabel , recorded as by some phosphoric finger was the burning fact , that isabel was his sister . why then ? how then ? whence then this utter nothing of his acts ? did he stagger at the thought , that at the first announcement to his mother concerning isabel , and his resolution to own her boldly and lovingly , his proud mother , spurning the reflection on his father , would likewise spurn pierre and isabel , and denounce both him and her , and hate them both alike , as unnatural accomplices against the good name of the purest of husbands and parents ? not at all . such a thought was not in him . for had he not already resolved , that his mother should know nothing of the fact of isabel ? -- but how now ? what then ? how was isabel to be acknowledged to the world , if his mother was to know nothing of that acknowledgment ? -- short-sighted , miserable palterer and huckster , thou hast been playing a most fond and foolish game with thyself ! fool and coward ! coward and fool ! tear thyself open , and read there the confounding story of thy blind dotishness ! thy two grand resolutions -- the public acknowledgment of isabel , and the charitable withholding of her existence from thy own mother , -- these are impossible adjuncts. -- likewise , thy so magnanimous purpose to screen thy father 's honorable memory from reproach , and thy other intention , the open vindication of thy fraternalness to isabel , -- these also are impossible adjuncts . and the having individually entertained four such resolves , without perceiving that once brought together , they all mutually expire ; this , this ineffable folly , pierre , brands thee in the forehead for an unaccountable infatuate !
melville	pierre	well may'st thou distrust thyself , and curse thyself , and tear thy hamlet and thy hell ! oh ! fool , blind fool , and a million times an ass ! go , go , thou poor and feeble one ! high deeds are not for such blind grubs as thou ! quit isabel , and go to lucy ! beg humble pardon of thy mother , and hereafter be a more obedient and good boy to her , pierre -- pierre , pierre , -- infatuate !
melville	pierre	impossible would it be now to tell all the confusion and confoundings in the soul of pierre , so soon as the above absurdities in his mind presented themselves first to his combining consciousness . he would fain have disowned the very memory and the mind which produced to him such an immense scandal upon his common sanity . now indeed did all the fiery floods in the inferno , and all the rolling gloom in hamlet suffocate him at once in flame and smoke . the cheeks of his soul collapsed in him : he dashed himself in blind fury and swift madness against the wall , and fell dabbling in the vomit of his loathed identity .
melville	pierre	book x . the unprecedented final resolution of pierre . i. glorified be his gracious memory who first said , the deepest gloom precedes the day . we care not whether the saying will prove true to the utmost bounds of things ; sufficient that it sometimes does hold true within the bounds of earthly finitude .
melville	pierre	next morning pierre rose from the floor of his chamber , haggard and tattered in body from his past night 's utter misery , but stoically serene and symmetrical in soul , with the foretaste of what then seemed to him a planned and perfect future . now he thinks he knows that the wholly unanticipated storm which had so terribly burst upon him , had yet burst upon him for his good ; for the place , which in its undetected incipiency , the storm had obscurely occupied in his soul , seemed now clear sky to him ; and all his horizon seemed distinctly commanded by him .
melville	pierre	his resolution was a strange and extraordinary one ; but therefore it only the better met a strange and extraordinary emergency . but it was not only strange and extraordinary in its novelty of mere aspect , but it was wonderful in its unequaled renunciation of himself .
melville	pierre	from the first , determined at all hazards to hold his father 's fair fame inviolate from any thing he should do in reference to protecting isabel , and extending to her a brother 's utmost devotedness and love ; and equally determined not to shake his mother 's lasting peace by any useless exposure of unwelcome facts ; and yet vowed in his deepest soul some way to embrace isabel before the world , and yield to her his constant consolation and companionship ; and finding no possible mode of unitedly compassing all these ends , without a most singular act of pious imposture , which he thought all heaven would justify in him , since he himself was to be the grand self-renouncing victim ; therefore , this was his settled and immovable purpose now ; namely : to assume before the world , that by secret rites , pierre glendinning was already become the husband of isabel banford -- an assumption which would entirely warrant his dwelling in her continual company , and upon equal terms , taking her wherever the world admitted him ; and at the same time foreclose all sinister inquisitions bearing upon his deceased parent 's memory , or any way affecting his mother 's lasting peace , as indissolubly linked with that . true , he in embryo , foreknew , that the extraordinary thing he had resolved , would , in another way , indirectly though inevitably , dart a most keen pang into his mother 's heart ; but this then seemed to him part of the unavoidable vast price of his enthusiastic virtue ; and , thus minded , rather would he privately pain his living mother with a wound that might be curable , than cast world-wide and irremediable dishonor -- so it seemed to him -- upon his departed father .
melville	pierre	probably no other being than isabel could have produced upon pierre impressions powerful enough to eventuate in a final resolution so unparalleled as the above . but the wonderful melodiousness of her grief had touched the secret monochord within his breast , by an apparent magic , precisely similar to that which had moved the stringed tongue of her guitar to respond to the heart-strings of her own melancholy plaints . the deep voice of the being of isabel called to him from out the immense distances of sky and air , and there seemed no veto of the earth that could forbid her heavenly claim .
melville	pierre	during the three days that he had personally known her , and so been brought into magnetic contact with her , other persuasions and potencies than those direct ones , involved in her bewildering eyes and marvelous story , had unconsciously left their ineffaceable impressions on him , and perhaps without his privity , had mainly contributed to his resolve . she had impressed him as the glorious child of pride and grief , in whose countenance were traceable the divinest lineaments of both her parents . pride gave to her her nameless nobleness ; grief touched that nobleness with an angelical softness ; and again that softness was steeped in a most charitable humility , which was the foundation of her loftiest excellence of all .
melville	pierre	neither by word or letter had isabel betrayed any spark of those more common emotions and desires which might not unreasonably be ascribed to an ordinary person placed in circumstances like hers . though almost penniless , she had not invoked the pecuniary bounty of pierre ; and though she was altogether silent on that subject , yet pierre could not but be strangely sensible of something in her which disdained to voluntarily hang upon the mere bounty even of a brother . nor , though she by various nameless ways , manifested her consciousness of being surrounded by uncongenial and inferior beings , while yet descended from a generous stock , and personally meriting the most refined companionships which the wide world could yield ; nevertheless , she had not demanded of pierre that he should array her in brocade , and lead her forth among the rare and opulent ladies of the land . but while thus evincing her intuitive , true lady-likeness and nobleness by this entire freedom from all sordid motives , neither had she merged all her feelings in any sickly sentimentalities of sisterly affection toward her so suddenly discovered brother ; which , in the case of a naturally unattractive woman in her circumstances , would not have been altogether alluring to pierre . no . that intense and indescribable longing , which her letter by its very incoherencies had best embodied , proceeded from no base , vain , or ordinary motive whatever ; but was the unsuppressible and unmistakable cry of the godhead through her soul , commanding pierre to fly to her , and do his highest and most glorious duty in the world .
melville	pierre	nor now , as it changedly seemed to pierre , did that duty consist in stubbornly flying in the marble face of the past , and striving to reverse the decree which had pronounced that isabel could never perfectly inherit all the privileges of a legitimate child of her father . and thoroughly now he felt , that even as this would in the present case be both preposterous in itself and cruel in effect to both the living and the dead , so was it entirely undesired by isabel , who though once yielding to a momentary burst of aggressive enthusiasm , yet in her more wonted mood of mournfulness and sweetness , evinced no such lawless wandering . thoroughly , now he felt , that isabel was content to live obscure in her paternal identity , so long as she could any way appease her deep longings for the constant love and sympathy and close domestic contact of some one of her blood . so that pierre had no slightest misgiving that upon learning the character of his scheme , she would deem it to come short of her natural expectations ; while so far as its apparent strangeness was concerned , -- a strangeness , perhaps invincible to squeamish and humdrum women -- here pierre anticipated no obstacle in isabel ; for her whole past was strange , and strangeness seemed best befitting to her future .
melville	pierre	but had pierre now reread the opening paragraph of her letter to him , he might have very quickly derived a powerful anticipative objection from his sister , which his own complete disinterestedness concealed from him . though pierre had every reason to believe that -- owing to her secluded and humble life -- isabel was in entire ignorance of the fact of his precise relation to lucy tartan : -- an ignorance , whose first indirect and unconscious manifestation in isabel , had been unspeakably welcome to him ; -- and though , of course , he had both wisely and benevolently abstained from enlightening her on that point ; still , notwithstanding this , was it possible that any true-hearted noble girl like isabel , would , to benefit herself , willingly become a participator in an act , which would prospectively and forever bar the blessed boon of marriageable love from one so young and generous as pierre , and eternally entangle him in a fictitious alliance , which , though in reality but a web of air , yet in effect would prove a wall of iron ; for the same powerful motive which induced the thought of forming such an alliance , would always thereafter forbid that tacit exposure of its fictitiousness , which would be consequent upon its public discontinuance , and the real nuptials of pierre with any other being during the lifetime of isabel .
melville	pierre	but according to what view you take of it , it is either the gracious or the malicious gift of the great gods to man , that on the threshold of any wholly new and momentous devoted enterprise , the thousand ulterior intricacies and emperilings to which it must conduct ; these , at the outset , are mostly withheld from sight ; and so , through her ever-primeval wilderness fortune 's knight rides on , alike ignorant of the palaces or the pitfalls in its heart . surprising , and past all ordinary belief , are those strange oversights and inconsistencies , into which the enthusiastic meditation upon unique or extreme resolves will sometimes beget in young and over-ardent souls . that all-comprehending oneness , that calm representativeness , by which a steady philosophic mind reaches forth and draws to itself , in their collective entirety , the objects of its contemplations ; that pertains not to the young enthusiast . by his eagerness , all objects are deceptively foreshortened ; by his intensity each object is viewed as detached ; so that essentially and relatively every thing is misseen by him . already have we exposed that passing preposterousness in pierre , which by reason of the above-named cause which we have endeavored to portray , induced him to cherish for a time four unitedly impossible designs . and now we behold this hapless youth all eager to involve himself in such an inextricable twist of fate , that the three dextrous maids themselves could hardly disentangle him , if once he tie the complicating knots about him and isabel .
melville	pierre	ah , thou rash boy ! are there no couriers in the air to warn thee away from these emperilings , and point thee to those cretan labyrinths , to which thy life 's cord is leading thee ? where now are the high beneficences ? whither fled the sweet angels that are alledged guardians to man ?
melville	pierre	not that the impulsive pierre wholly overlooked all that was menacing to him in his future , if now he acted out his most rare resolve ; but eagerly foreshortened by him , they assumed not their full magnitude of menacing ; nor , indeed , -- so riveted now his purpose -- were they pushed up to his face , would he for that renounce his self-renunciation ; while concerning all things more immediately contingent upon his central resolution ; these were , doubtless , in a measure , foreseen and understood by him . perfectly , at least , he seemed to foresee and understand , that the present hope of lucy tartan must be banished from his being ; that this would carry a terrible pang to her , which in the natural recoil would but redouble his own ; that to the world all his heroicness , standing equally unexplained and unsuspected , therefore the world would denounce him as infamously false to his betrothed ; reckless of the most binding human vows ; a secret wooer and wedder of an unknown and enigmatic girl ; a spurner of all a loving mother 's wisest counselings ; a bringer down of lasting reproach upon an honorable name ; a besotted self-exile from a most prosperous house and bounteous fortune ; and lastly , that now his whole life would , in the eyes of the wide humanity , be covered with an all-pervading haze of incurable sinisterness , possibly not to be removed even in the concluding hour of death .
melville	pierre	such , oh thou son of man ! are the perils and the miseries thou callest down on thee , when , even in a virtuous cause , thou steppest aside from those arbitrary lines of conduct , by which the common world , however base and dastardly , surrounds thee for thy worldly good .
melville	pierre	ofttimes it is very wonderful to trace the rarest and profoundest things , and find their probable origin in something extremely trite or trivial . yet so strange and complicate is the human soul ; so much is confusedly evolved from out itself , and such vast and varied accessions come to it from abroad , and so impossible is it always to distinguish between these two , that the wisest man were rash , positively to assign the precise and incipient origination of his final thoughts and acts . far as we blind moles can see , man 's life seems but an acting upon mysterious hints ; it is somehow hinted to us , to do thus or thus . for surely no mere mortal who has at all gone down into himself will ever pretend that his slightest thought or act solely originates in his own defined identity . this preamble seems not entirely unnecessary as usher of the strange conceit , that possibly the latent germ of pierre 's proposed extraordinary mode of executing his proposed extraordinary resolve -- namely , the nominal conversion of a sister into a wife -- might have been found in the previous conversational conversion of a mother into a sister ; for hereby he had habituated his voice and manner to a certain fictitiousness in one of the closest domestic relations of life ; and since man 's moral texture is very porous , and things assumed upon the surface , at last strike in -- hence , this outward habituation to the above-named fictitiousness had insensibly disposed his mind to it as it were ; but only innocently and pleasantly as yet . if , by any possibility , this general conceit be so , then to pierre the times of sportfulness were as pregnant with the hours of earnestness ; and in sport he learnt the terms of woe .
melville	pierre	ii . if next to that resolve concerning his lasting fraternal succor to isabel , there was at this present time any determination in pierre absolutely inflexible , and partaking at once of the sacredness and the indissolubleness of the most solemn oath , it was the enthusiastic , and apparently wholly supererogatory resolution to hold his father 's memory untouched ; nor to one single being in the world reveal the paternity of isabel . unrecallably dead and gone from out the living world , again returned to utter helplessness , so far as this world went ; his perished father seemed to appeal to the dutifulness and mercifulness of pierre , in terms far more moving than though the accents proceeded from his mortal mouth . and what though not through the sin of pierre , but through his father 's sin , that father 's fair fame now lay at the mercy of the son , and could only be kept inviolate by the son 's free sacrifice of all earthly felicity ; -- what if this were so ? it but struck a still loftier chord in the bosom of the son , and filled him with infinite magnanimities . never had the generous pierre cherished the heathenish conceit , that even in the general world , sin is a fair object to be stretched on the cruelest racks by self-complacent virtue , that self-complacent virtue may feed her lily-liveredness on the pallor of sin 's anguish . for perfect virtue does not more loudly claim our approbation , than repented sin in its concludedness does demand our utmost tenderness and concern . and as the more immense the virtue , so should be the more immense our approbation ; likewise the more immense the sin , the more infinite our pity . in some sort , sin hath its sacredness , not less than holiness . and great sin calls forth more magnanimity than small virtue . what man , who is a man , does not feel livelier and more generous emotions toward the great god of sin -- satan , -- than toward yonder haberdasher , who only is a sinner in the small and entirely honorable way of trade ?
melville	pierre	though pierre profoundly shuddered at that impenetrable yet blackly significant nebulousness , which the wild story of isabel threw around the early life of his father ; yet as he recalled the dumb anguish of the invocation of the empty and the ashy hand uplifted from his father 's death-bed , he most keenly felt that of whatsoever unknown shade his father 's guilt might be , yet in the final hour of death it had been most dismally repented of ; by a repentance only the more full of utter wretchedness , that it was a consuming secret in him . mince the matter how his family would , had not his father died a raver ? whence that raving , following so prosperous a life ? whence , but from the cruelest compunctions ?
melville	pierre	touched thus , and strung in all his sinews and his nerves to the holding of his father 's memory intact , -- pierre turned his confronting and unfrightened face toward lucy tartan , and stilly vowed that not even she should know the whole ; no , not know the least .
melville	pierre	there is an inevitable keen cruelty in the loftier heroism . it is not heroism only to stand unflinched ourselves in the hour of suffering ; but it is heroism to stand unflinched both at our own and at some loved one 's united suffering ; a united suffering , which we could put an instant period to , if we would but renounce the glorious cause for which ourselves do bleed , and see our most loved one bleed . if he would not reveal his father 's shame to the common world , whose favorable opinion for himself , pierre now despised ; how then reveal it to the woman he adored ? to her , above all others , would he now uncover his father 's tomb , and bid her behold from what vile attaintings he himself had sprung ? so pierre turned round and tied lucy to the same stake which must hold himself , for he too plainly saw , that it could not be , but that both their hearts must burn .
melville	pierre	yes , his resolve concerning his father 's memory involved the necessity of assuming even to lucy his marriage with isabel . here he could not explain himself , even to her . this would aggravate the sharp pang of parting , by self-suggested , though wholly groundless surmising in lucy 's mind , in the most miserable degree contaminating to her idea of him . but on this point , he still fondly trusted that without at all marring his filial bond , he would be enabled by some significant intimations to arrest in lucy 's mind those darker imaginings which might find entrance there ; and if he could not set her wholly right , yet prevent her from going wildly wrong .
melville	pierre	for his mother pierre was more prepared . he considered that by an inscrutable decree , which it was but foolishness to try to evade , or shun , or deny existence to , since he felt it so profoundly pressing on his inmost soul ; the family of the glendinnings was imperiously called upon to offer up a victim to the gods of woe ; one grand victim at the least ; and that grand victim must be his mother , or himself . if he disclosed his secret to the world , then his mother was made the victim ; if at all hazards he kept it to himself , then himself would be the victim . a victim as respecting his mother , because under the peculiar circumstances of the case , the non-disclosure of the secret involved her entire and infamy-engendering misconception of himself . but to this he bowed submissive .
melville	pierre	one other thing -- and the last to be here named , because the very least in the conscious thoughts of pierre ; one other thing remained to menace him with assured disastrousness . this thing it was , which though but dimly hinted of as yet , still in the apprehension must have exerted a powerful influence upon pierre , in preparing him for the worst .
melville	pierre	his father 's last and fatal sickness had seized him suddenly . both the probable concealed distraction of his mind with reference to his early life as recalled to him in an evil hour , and his consequent mental wanderings ; these , with other reasons , had prevented him from framing a new will to supersede one made shortly after his marriage , and ere pierre was born . by that will which as yet had never been dragged into the courts of law ; and which , in the fancied security of her own and her son 's congenial and loving future , mrs. glendinning had never but once , and then inconclusively , offered to discuss , with a view to a better and more appropriate ordering of things to meet circumstances non-existent at the period the testament was framed ; by that will , all the glendinning property was declared his mother 's .
melville	pierre	acutely sensible to those prophetic intimations in him , which painted in advance the haughty temper of his offended mother , as all bitterness and scorn toward a son , once the object of her proudest joy , but now become a deep reproach , as not only rebellious to her , but glaringly dishonorable before the world ; pierre distinctly foresaw , that as she never would have permitted isabel banford in her true character to cross her threshold ; neither would she now permit isabel banford to cross her threshold in any other , and disguised character ; least of all , as that unknown and insidious girl , who by some pernicious arts had lured her only son from honor into infamy . but not to admit isabel , was now to exclude pierre , if indeed on independent grounds of exasperation against himself , his mother would not cast him out .
melville	pierre	nor did the same interior intimations in him which fore-painted the above bearing of his mother , abstain to trace her whole haughty heart as so unrelentingly set against him , that while she would close her doors against both him and his fictitious wife , so also she would not willingly contribute one copper to support them in a supposed union so entirely abhorrent to her . and though pierre was not so familiar with the science of the law , as to be quite certain what the law , if appealed to concerning the provisions of his father 's will , would decree concerning any possible claims of the son to share with the mother in the property of the sire ; yet he prospectively felt an invincible repugnance to dragging his dead father 's hand and seal into open court , and fighting over them with a base mercenary motive , and with his own mother for the antagonist . for so thoroughly did his infallible presentiments paint his mother 's character to him , as operated upon and disclosed in all those fiercer traits , -- hitherto held in abeyance by the mere chance and felicity of circumstances , -- that he felt assured that her exasperation against him would even meet the test of a public legal contention concerning the glendinning property . for indeed there was a reserved strength and masculineness in the character of his mother , from which on all these points pierre had every thing to dread . besides , will the matter how he would , pierre for nearly two whole years to come , would still remain a minor , an infant in the eye of the law , incapable of personally asserting any legal claim ; and though he might sue by his next friend , yet who would be his voluntary next friend , when the execution of his great resolve would , for him , depopulate all the world of friends ?
melville	pierre	now to all these things , and many more , seemed the soul of this infatuated young enthusiast braced . iii . there is a dark , mad mystery in some human hearts , which , sometimes , during the tyranny of a usurper mood , leads them to be all eagerness to cast off the most intense beloved bond , as a hindrance to the attainment of whatever transcendental object that usurper mood so tyrannically suggests . then the beloved bond seems to hold us to no essential good ; lifted to exalted mounts , we can dispense with all the vale ; endearments we spurn ; kisses are blisters to us ; and forsaking the palpitating forms of mortal love , we emptily embrace the boundless and the unbodied air . we think we are not human ; we become as immortal bachelors and gods ; but again , like the greek gods themselves , prone we descend to earth ; glad to be uxorious once more ; glad to hide these god-like heads within the bosoms made of too-seducing clay .
melville	pierre	weary with the invariable earth , the restless sailor breaks from every enfolding arm , and puts to sea in height of tempest that blows off shore . but in long night-watches at the antipodes , how heavily that ocean gloom lies in vast bales upon the deck ; thinking that that very moment in his deserted hamlet-home the household sun is high , and many a sun-eyed maiden meridian as the sun . he curses fate ; himself he curses ; his senseless madness , which is himself . for whoso once has known this sweet knowledge , and then fled it ; in absence , to him the avenging dream will come .
melville	pierre	pierre was now this vulnerable god ; this self-upbraiding sailor ; this dreamer of the avenging dream . though in some things he had unjuggled himself , and forced himself to eye the prospect as it was ; yet , so far as lucy was concerned , he was at bottom still a juggler . true , in his extraordinary scheme , lucy was so intimately interwoven , that it seemed impossible for him at all to cast his future without some way having that heart 's love in view . but ignorant of its quantity as yet , or fearful of ascertaining it ; like an algebraist , for the real lucy he , in his scheming thoughts , had substituted but a sign -- some empty _x_ -- and in the ultimate solution of the problem , that empty _x_ still figured ; not the real lucy .
melville	pierre	but now , when risen from the abasement of his chamber-floor , and risen from the still profounder prostration of his soul , pierre had thought that all the horizon of his dark fate was commanded by him ; all his resolutions clearly defined , and immovably decreed ; now finally , to top all , there suddenly slid into his inmost heart the living and breathing form of lucy . his lungs collapsed ; his eyeballs glared ; for the sweet imagined form , so long buried alive in him , seemed now as gliding on him from the grave ; and her light hair swept far adown her shroud .
melville	pierre	then , for the time , all minor things were whelmed in him ; his mother , isabel , the whole wide world ; and one only thing remained to him ; -- this all-including query -- lucy or god ? but here we draw a vail . some nameless struggles of the soul can not be painted , and some woes will not be told . let the ambiguous procession of events reveal their own ambiguousness .
melville	pierre	book xi . he crosses the rubicon i . sucked within the maelstrom , man must go round . strike at one end the longest conceivable row of billiard balls in close contact , and the furthermost ball will start forth , while all the rest stand still ; and yet that last ball was not struck at all . so , through long previous generations , whether of births or thoughts , fate strikes the present man . idly he disowns the blow 's effect , because he felt no blow , and indeed , received no blow . but pierre was not arguing fixed fate and free will , now ; fixed fate and free will were arguing him , and fixed fate got the better in the debate .
melville	pierre	the peculiarities of those influences which on the night and early morning following the last interview with isabel , persuaded pierre to the adoption of his final resolve , did now irresistibly impel him to a remarkable instantaneousness in his actions , even as before he had proved a lagger .
melville	pierre	without being consciously that way pointed , through the desire of anticipating any objections on the part of isabel to the assumption of a marriage between himself and her ; pierre was now impetuously hurried into an act , which should have the effective virtue of such an executed intention , without its corresponding motive . because , as the primitive resolve so deplorably involved lucy , her image was then prominent in his mind ; and hence , because he felt all eagerness to hold her no longer in suspense , but by a certain sort of charity of cruelty , at once to pronounce to her her fate ; therefore , it was among his first final thoughts that morning to go to lucy . and to this , undoubtedly , so trifling a circumstance as her being nearer to him , geographically , than isabel , must have contributed some added , though unconscious influence , in his present fateful frame of mind .
melville	pierre	on the previous undetermined days , pierre had solicitously sought to disguise his emotions from his mother , by a certain carefulness and choiceness in his dress . but now , since his very soul was forced to wear a mask , he would wear no paltry palliatives and disguisements on his body . he went to the cottage of lucy as disordered in his person , as haggard in his face .
melville	pierre	ii . she was not risen yet . so , the strange imperious instantaneousness in him , impelled him to go straight to her chamber-door , and in a voice of mild invincibleness , demand immediate audience , for the matter pressed .
melville	pierre	already namelessly concerned and alarmed for her lover , now eight-and-forty hours absent on some mysterious and undisclosable affair ; lucy , at this surprising summons was overwhelmed with sudden terror ; and in oblivion of all ordinary proprieties , responded to pierre 's call , by an immediate assent .
melville	pierre	opening the door , he advanced slowly and deliberately toward her ; and as lucy caught his pale determined figure , she gave a cry of groping misery , which knew not the pang that caused it , and lifted herself trembling in her bed ; but without uttering one word .
melville	pierre	pierre sat down on the bedside ; and his set eyes met her terrified and virgin aspect . `` decked in snow-white , and pale of cheek , thou indeed art fitted for the altar ; but not that one of which thy fond heart did'st dream : -- so fair a victim ! ''
melville	pierre	`` pierre ! '' `` 't is the last cruelty of tyrants to make their enemies slay each other . '' `` my heart ! my heart ! '' `` nay ; -- -- lucy , i am married . '' the girl was no more pale , but white as any leper ; the bed-clothes trembled to the concealed shudderings of all her limbs ; one moment she sat looking vacantly into the blank eyes of pierre , and then fell over toward him in a swoon .
melville	pierre	swift madness mounted into the brain of pierre ; all the past seemed as a dream , and all the present an unintelligible horror . he lifted her , and extended her motionless form upon the bed , and stamped for succor . the maid martha came running into the room , and beholding those two inexplicable figures , shrieked , and turned in terror . but pierre 's repeated cry rallied martha from this , and darting out of the chamber , she returned with a sharp restorative , which at length brought lucy back to life .
melville	pierre	`` martha ! martha ! '' now murmured lucy , in a scarce audible whispering , and shuddering in the maid 's own shuddering arms , `` quick , quick ; come to me -- drive it away ! wake me ! wake me ! '' `` nay , pray god to sleep again , '' cried martha , bending over her and embracing her , and half-turning upon pierre with a glance of loathing indignation . `` in god 's holy name , sir , what may this be ? how came you here ; accursed ! ''
melville	pierre	`` accursed ? -- it is well . is she herself again , martha ? '' `` thou hast somehow murdered her ; how then be herself again ? my sweet mistress ! oh , my young mistress ! tell me ! tell me ! '' and she bent low over her .
melville	pierre	pierre now advanced toward the bed , making a gesture for the maid to leave them ; but soon as lucy re-caught his haggard form , she whisperingly wailed again , `` martha ! martha ! drive it away ! -- there -- there ! him -- him ! '' and shut her eyes convulsively , with arms abhorrently outstretched .
melville	pierre	`` monster ! incomprehensible fiend ! '' cried the anew terror-smitten maid -- '' depart ! see ! she dies away at the sight of thee -- begone ! wouldst thou murder her afresh ? begone ! '' starched and frozen by his own emotion , pierre silently turned and quitted the chamber ; and heavily descending the stairs , tramped heavily -- as a man slowly bearing a great burden -- through a long narrow passage leading to a wing in the rear of the cottage , and knocking at miss lanyllyn 's door , summoned her to lucy , who , he briefly said , had fainted . then , without waiting for any response , left the house , and went directly to the mansion .
melville	pierre	iii . `` is my mother up yet ? '' said he to dates , whom he met in the hall . `` not yet , sir ; -- heavens , sir ! are you sick ? '' `` to death ! let me pass . '' ascending toward his mother 's chamber , he heard a coming step , and met her on the great middle landing of the stairs , where in an ample niche , a marble group of the temple-polluting laocoon and his two innocent children , caught in inextricable snarls of snakes , writhed in eternal torments .
melville	pierre	`` mother , go back with me to thy chamber . '' she eyed his sudden presence with a dark but repressed foreboding ; drew herself up haughtily and repellingly , and with a quivering lip , said , `` pierre , thou thyself hast denied me thy confidence , and thou shall not force me back to it so easily . speak ! what is that now between thee and me ? ''
melville	pierre	`` i am married , mother . '' `` great god ! to whom ? '' `` not to lucy tartan , mother . '' `` that thou merely sayest 't is not lucy , without saying who indeed it is , this is good proof she is something vile . does lucy know thy marriage ? ''
melville	pierre	`` i am but just from lucy 's . '' thus far mrs. glendinning 's rigidity had been slowly relaxing . now she clutched the balluster , bent over , and trembled , for a moment . then erected all her haughtiness again , and stood before pierre in incurious , unappeasable grief and scorn for him .
melville	pierre	`` my dark soul prophesied something dark . if already thou hast not found other lodgment , and other table than this house supplies , then seek it straight . beneath my roof , and at my table , he who was once pierre glendinning no more puts himself . ''
melville	pierre	she turned from him , and with a tottering step climbed the winding stairs , and disappeared from him ; while in the balluster he held , pierre seemed to feel the sudden thrill running down to him from his mother 's convulsive grasp .
melville	pierre	he stared about him with an idiot eye ; staggered to the floor below , to dumbly quit the house ; but as he crossed its threshold , his foot tripped upon its raised ledge ; he pitched forward upon the stone portico , and fell . he seemed as jeeringly hurled from beneath his own ancestral roof .
melville	pierre	iv . passing through the broad court-yard 's postern , pierre closed it after him , and then turned and leaned upon it , his eyes fixed upon the great central chimney of the mansion , from which a light blue smoke was wreathing gently into the morning air .
melville	pierre	`` the hearth-stone from which thou risest , never more , i inly feel , will these feet press . oh god , what callest thou that which has thus made pierre a vagabond ? '' he walked slowly away , and passing the windows of lucy , looked up , and saw the white curtains closely drawn , the white-cottage profoundly still , and a white saddle-horse tied before the gate .
melville	pierre	`` i would enter , but again would her abhorrent wails repel ; what more can i now say or do to her ? i can not explain . she knows all i purposed to disclose . ay , but thou didst cruelly burst upon her with it ; thy impetuousness , thy instantaneousness hath killed her , pierre ! -- nay , nay , nay ! -- cruel tidings who can gently break ? if to stab be inevitable ; then instant be the dagger ! those curtains are close drawn upon her ; so let me upon her sweet image draw the curtains of my soul . sleep , sleep , sleep , sleep , thou angel ! -- wake no more to pierre , nor to thyself , my lucy ! ''
melville	pierre	passing on now hurriedly and blindly , he jostled against some oppositely-going wayfarer . the man paused amazed ; and looking up , pierre recognized a domestic of the mansion . that instantaneousness which now impelled him in all his actions , again seized the ascendency in him . ignoring the dismayed expression of the man at thus encountering his young master , pierre commanded him to follow him . going straight to the `` black swan , '' the little village inn , he entered the first vacant room , and bidding the man be seated , sought the keeper of the house , and ordered pen and paper .
melville	pierre	if fit opportunity offer in the hour of unusual affliction , minds of a certain temperament find a strange , hysterical relief , in a wild , perverse humorousness , the more alluring from its entire unsuitableness to the occasion ; although they seldom manifest this trait toward those individuals more immediately involved in the cause or the effect of their suffering . the cool censoriousness of the mere philosopher would denominate such conduct as nothing short of temporary madness ; and perhaps it is , since , in the inexorable and inhuman eye of mere undiluted reason , all grief , whether on our own account , or that of others , is the sheerest unreason and insanity .
melville	pierre	the note now written was the following : `` _for that fine old fellow , dates._ `` dates , my old boy , bestir thyself now . go to my room , dates , and bring me down my mahogany strong-box and lock-up , the thing covered with blue chintz ; strap it very carefully , my sweet dates , it is rather heavy , and set it just without the postern . then back and bring me down my writing-desk , and set that , too , just without the postern . then back yet again , and bring me down the old camp-bed ( see that all the parts be there ) , and bind the case well with a cord . then go to the left corner little drawer in my wardrobe , and thou wilt find my visiting-cards . tack one on the chest , and the desk , and the camp-bed case . then get all my clothes together , and pack them in trunks ( not forgetting the two old military cloaks , my boy ) , and tack cards on them also , my good dates . then fly round three times indefinitely , my good dates , and wipe a little of the perspiration off . and then -- let me see -- then , my good dates -- why what then ? why , this much . pick up all papers of all sorts that may be lying round my chamber , and see them burned . and then -- have old white hoof put to the lightest farm-wagon , and send the chest , and the desk , and the camp-bed , and the trunks to the 'black swan , ' where i shall call for them , when i am ready , and not before , sweet dates . so god bless thee , my fine , old , imperturbable dates , and adieu !
melville	pierre	`` thy old young master , pierre . `` _nota bene_ -- mark well , though , dates . should my mother possibly interrupt thee , say that it is my orders , and mention what it is i send for ; but on no account show this to thy mistress -- d 'ye hear ?
melville	pierre	pierre again . '' folding this scrawl into a grotesque shape , pierre ordered the man to take it forthwith to dates . but the man , all perplexed , hesitated , turning the billet over in his hand ; till pierre loudly and violently bade him begone ; but as the man was then rapidly departing in a panic , pierre called him back and retracted his rude words ; but as the servant now lingered again , perhaps thinking to avail himself of this repentant mood in pierre , to say something in sympathy or remonstrance to him , pierre ordered him off with augmented violence , and stamped for him to begone .
melville	pierre	apprising the equally perplexed old landlord that certain things would in the course of that forenoon be left for him , ( pierre , ) at the inn ; and also desiring him to prepare a chamber for himself and wife that night ; some chamber with a commodious connecting room , which might answer for a dressing-room ; and likewise still another chamber for a servant ; pierre departed the place , leaving the old landlord staring vacantly at him , and dumbly marveling what horrible thing had happened to turn the brain of his fine young favorite and old shooting comrade , master pierre .
melville	pierre	soon the short old man went out bare-headed upon the low porch of the inn , descended its one step , and crossed over to the middle of the road , gazing after pierre . and only as pierre turned up a distant lane , did his amazement and his solicitude find utterance .
melville	pierre	`` i taught him -- yes , old casks ; -- the best shot in all the country round is master pierre ; -- pray god he hits not now the bull 's eye in himself. -- married ? married ? and coming here ? -- this is pesky strange ! ''
melville	pierre	book xii . isabel : mrs. glendinning : the portrait : and lucy . i . when on the previous night pierre had left the farm-house where isabel harbored , it will be remembered that no hour , either of night or day , no special time at all had been assigned for a succeeding interview . it was isabel , who for some doubtlessly sufficient reason of her own , had , for the first meeting , assigned the early hour of darkness .
melville	pierre	as now , when the full sun was well up the heavens , pierre drew near the farm-house of the ulvers , he descried isabel , standing without the little dairy-wing , occupied in vertically arranging numerous glittering shield-like milk-pans on a long shelf , where they might purifyingly meet the sun . her back was toward him . as pierre passed through the open wicket and crossed the short soft green sward , he unconsciously muffled his footsteps , and now standing close behind his sister , touched her shoulder and stood still .
melville	pierre	she started , trembled , turned upon him swiftly , made a low , strange cry , and then gazed rivetedly and imploringly upon him . `` i look rather queerish , sweet isabel , do i not ? '' said pierre at last with a writhed and painful smile .
melville	pierre	`` my brother , my blessed brother ! -- speak -- tell me -- what has happened -- what hast thou done ? oh ! oh ! i should have warned thee before , pierre , pierre ; it is my fault -- mine , mine ! '' `` _what_ is thy fault , sweet isabel ? ''
melville	pierre	`` thou hast revealed isabel to thy mother , pierre . '' `` i have not , isabel . mrs. glendinning knows not thy secret at all . '' `` mrs . glendinning ? -- that 's , -- that 's thine own mother , pierre ! in heaven 's name , my brother , explain thyself . knows not my secret , and yet thou here so suddenly , and with such a fatal aspect ? come , come with me into the house . quick , pierre , why dost thou not stir ? oh , my god ! if mad myself sometimes , i am to make mad him who loves me best , and who , i fear , has in some way ruined himself for me ; -- then , let me no more stand upright on this sod , but fall prone beneath it , that i may be hidden ! tell me ! '' catching pierre 's arms in both her frantic hands -- '' tell me , do i blast where i look ? is my face gorgon 's ? ''
melville	pierre	`` nay , sweet isabel ; but it hath a more sovereign power ; that turned to stone ; thine might turn white marble into mother 's milk . '' `` come with me -- come quickly . '' they passed into the dairy , and sat down on a bench by the honey-suckled casement .
melville	pierre	`` pierre , forever fatal and accursed be the day my longing heart called thee to me , if now , in the very spring-time of our related love , thou art minded to play deceivingly with me , even though thou should'st fancy it for my good . speak to me ; oh speak to me , my brother ! ''
melville	pierre	`` thou hintest of deceiving one for one 's good . now supposing , sweet isabel , that in no case would i affirmatively deceive thee ; -- in no case whatever ; -- would'st thou then be willing for thee and me to piously deceive others , for both their and our united good ? -- thou sayest nothing . now , then , is it _my_ turn , sweet isabel , to bid thee speak to me , oh speak to me ! ''
melville	pierre	`` that unknown , approaching thing , seemeth ever ill , my brother , which must have unfrank heralds to go before . oh , pierre , dear , dear pierre ; be very careful with me ! this strange , mysterious , unexampled love between us , makes me all plastic in thy hand . be very careful with me . i know little out of me . the world seems all one unknown india to me . look up , look on me , pierre ; say now , thou wilt be very careful ; say so , say so , pierre ! ''
melville	pierre	`` if the most exquisite , and fragile filagree of genoa be carefully handled by its artisan ; if sacred nature carefully folds , and warms , and by inconceivable attentivenesses eggs round and round her minute and marvelous embryoes ; then , isabel , do i most carefully and most tenderly egg thee , gentlest one , and the fate of thee ! short of the great god , isabel , there lives none who will be more careful with thee , more infinitely considerate and delicate with thee . ''
melville	pierre	`` from my deepest heart , do i believe thee , pierre . yet thou mayest be very delicate in some point , where delicateness is not all essential , and in some quick impulsive hour , omit thy fullest heedfulness somewhere where heedlessness were most fatal . nay , nay , my brother ; bleach these locks snow-white , thou sun ! if i have any thought to reproach thee , pierre , or betray distrust of thee . but earnestness must sometimes seem suspicious , else it is none . pierre , pierre , all thy aspect speaks eloquently of some already executed resolution , born in suddenness . since i last saw thee , pierre , some deed irrevocable has been done by thee . my soul is stiff and starched to it ; now tell me what it is ? ''
melville	pierre	`` thou , and i , and delly ulver , to-morrow morning depart this whole neighborhood , and go to the distant city. -- that is it . '' `` no more ? '' `` is it not enough ? '' `` there is something more , pierre . ''
melville	pierre	`` thou hast not yet answered a question i put to thee but just now . bethink thee , isabel . the deceiving of others by thee and me , in a thing wholly pertaining to ourselves , for their and our united good . wouldst thou ? ''
melville	pierre	`` i would do any thing that does not tend to the marring of thy best lasting fortunes , pierre . what is it thou wouldst have thee and me to do together ? i wait ; i wait ! ''
melville	pierre	`` let us go into the room of the double casement , my sister , '' said pierre , rising . `` nay , then ; if it can not be said here , then can i not do it anywhere , my brother ; for it would harm thee . ''
melville	pierre	`` girl ! '' cried pierre , sternly , `` if for thee i have lost '' -- but he checked himself . `` lost ? for me ? now does the very worst blacken on me . pierre ! pierre ! '' `` i was foolish , and sought but to frighten thee , my sister . it was very foolish . do thou now go on with thine innocent work here , and i will come again a few hours hence . let me go now . ''
melville	pierre	he was turning from her , when isabel sprang forward to him , caught him with both her arms round him , and held him so convulsively , that her hair sideways swept over him , and half concealed him .
melville	pierre	`` pierre , if indeed my soul hath cast on thee the same black shadow that my hair now flings on thee ; if thou hast lost aught for me ; then eternally is isabel lost to isabel , and isabel will not outlive this night . if i am indeed an accursing thing , i will not act the given part , but cheat the air , and die from it . see ; i let thee go , lest some poison i know not of distill upon thee from me . ''
melville	pierre	she slowly drooped , and trembled from him . but pierre caught her , and supported her . `` foolish , foolish one ! behold , in the very bodily act of loosing hold of me , thou dost reel and fall ; -- unanswerable emblem of the indispensable heart-stay , i am to thee , my sweet , sweet isabel ! prate not then of parting . ''
melville	pierre	`` what hast thou lost for me ? tell me ! '' `` a gainful loss , my sister ! '' `` 't is mere rhetoric ! what hast thou lost ? '' `` nothing that my inmost heart would now recall . i have bought inner love and glory by a price , which , large or small , i would not now have paid me back , so i must return the thing i bought . ''
melville	pierre	`` is love then cold , and glory white ? thy cheek is snowy , pierre . '' `` it should be , for i believe to god that i am pure , let the world think how it may . ''
melville	pierre	`` what hast thou lost ? '' `` not thee , nor the pride and glory of ever loving thee , and being a continual brother to thee , my best sister . nay , why dost thou now turn thy face from me ? ''
melville	pierre	`` with fine words he wheedles me , and coaxes me , not to know some secret thing . go , go , pierre , come to me when thou wilt . i am steeled now to the worst , and to the last . again i tell thee , i will do any thing -- yes , any thing that pierre commands -- for , though outer ill do lower upon us , still , deep within , thou wilt be careful , very careful with me , pierre ? ''
melville	pierre	`` thou art made of that fine , unshared stuff of which god makes his seraphim . but thy divine devotedness to me , is met by mine to thee . well mayest thou trust me , isabel ; and whatever strangest thing i may yet propose to thee , thy confidence , -- will it not bear me out ? surely thou will not hesitate to plunge , when i plunge first ; -- already have i plunged ! now thou canst not stay upon the bank . hearken , hearken to me. -- i seek not now to gain thy prior assent to a thing as yet undone ; but i call to thee now , isabel , from the depth of a foregone act , to ratify it , backward , by thy consent . look not so hard upon me . listen . i will tell all . isabel , though thou art all fearfulness to injure any living thing , least of all , thy brother ; still thy true heart foreknoweth not the myriad alliances and criss-crossings among mankind , the infinite entanglements of all social things , which forbids that one thread should fly the general fabric , on some new line of duty , without tearing itself and tearing others . listen . all that has happened up to this moment , and all that may be yet to happen , some sudden inspiration now assures me , inevitably proceeded from the first hour i saw thee . not possibly could it , or can it , be otherwise . therefore feel i , that i have some patience . listen . whatever outer things might possibly be mine ; whatever seeming brightest blessings ; yet now to live uncomforting and unloving to thee , isabel ; now to dwell domestically away from thee ; so that only by stealth , and base connivances of the night , i could come to thee as thy related brother ; this would be , and is , unutterably impossible . in my bosom a secret adder of self-reproach and self-infamy would never leave off its sting . listen . but without gratuitous dishonor to a memory which -- for right cause or wrong -- is ever sacred and inviolate to me , i can not be an open brother to thee , isabel . but thou wantest not the openness ; for thou dost not pine for empty nominalness , but for vital realness ; what thou wantest , is not the occasional openness of my brotherly love ; but its continual domestic confidence . do i not speak thine own hidden heart to thee ? say , isabel ? well , then , still listen to me . one only way presents to this ; a most strange way , isabel ; to the world , that never throbbed for thee in love , a most deceitful way ; but to all a harmless way ; so harmless in its essence , isabel , that , seems to me , pierre hath consulted heaven itself upon it , and heaven itself did not say nay . still , listen to me ; mark me . as thou knowest that thou wouldst now droop and die without me ; so would i without thee . we are equal there ; mark _that_ , too , isabel . i do not stoop to thee , nor thou to me ; but we both reach up alike to a glorious ideal ! now the continualness , the secretness , yet the always present domesticness of our love ; how may we best compass that , without jeopardizing the ever-sacred memory i hinted of ? one way -- one way -- only one ! a strange way , but most pure . listen . brace thyself : here , let me hold thee now ; and then whisper it to thee , isabel . come , i holding thee , thou canst not fall . ''
melville	pierre	he held her tremblingly ; she bent over toward him ; his mouth wet her ear ; he whispered it . the girl moved not ; was done with all her tremblings ; leaned closer to him , with an inexpressible strangeness of an intense love , new and inexplicable . over the face of pierre there shot a terrible self-revelation ; he imprinted repeated burning kisses upon her ; pressed hard her hand ; would not let go her sweet and awful passiveness .
melville	pierre	then they changed ; they coiled together , and entangledly stood mute . ii . mrs. glendinning walked her chamber ; her dress loosened . `` that such accursed vileness should proceed from me ! now will the tongued world say -- see the vile boy of mary glendinning ! -- deceitful ! thick with guilt , where i thought it was all guilelessness and gentlest docility to me . it has not happened ! it is not day ! were this thing so , i should go mad , and be shut up , and not walk here where every door is open to me. -- my own only son married to an unknown -- thing ! my own only son , false to his holiest plighted public vow -- and the wide world knowing to it ! he bears my name -- glendinning . i will disown it ; were it like this dress , i would tear my name off from me , and burn it till it shriveled to a crisp ! -- pierre ! pierre ! come back , come back , and swear it is not so ! it can not be ! wait : i will ring the bell , and see if it be so . ''
melville	pierre	she rung the bell with violence , and soon heard a responsive knock . `` come in ! -- nay , falter not ; '' ( throwing a shawl over her ) `` come in . stand there and tell me if thou darest , that my son was in this house this morning and met me on the stairs . darest thou say that ? ''
melville	pierre	dates looked confounded at her most unwonted aspect . `` say it ! find thy tongue ! or i will root mine out and fling it at thee ! say it ! '' `` my dear mistress ! '' `` i am not thy mistress ! but thou my master ; for , if thou sayest it , thou commandest me to madness. -- oh , vile boy ! -- begone from me ! ''
melville	pierre	she locked the door upon him , and swiftly and distractedly walked her chamber . she paused , and tossing down the curtains , shut out the sun from the two windows . another , but an unsummoned knock , was at the door . she opened it .
melville	pierre	`` my mistress , his reverence is below . i would not call you , but he insisted . '' `` let him come up . '' `` here ? immediately ? '' `` didst thou hear me ? let mr. falsgrave come up . '' as if suddenly and admonishingly made aware , by dates , of the ungovernable mood of mrs. glendinning , the clergyman entered the open door of her chamber with a most deprecating but honest reluctance , and apprehensiveness of he knew not what .
melville	pierre	`` be seated , sir ; stay , shut the door and lock it . '' `` madam ! '' `` _i_ will do it . be seated . hast thou seen him ? '' `` whom , madam ? -- master pierre ? '' `` him ! -- quick ! '' `` it was to speak of him i came , madam . he made a most extraordinary call upon me last night -- midnight . ''
melville	pierre	`` and thou marriedst him ? -- damn thee ! '' `` nay , nay , nay , madam ; there is something here i know not of -- i came to tell thee news , but thou hast some o'erwhelming tidings to reveal to me . ''
melville	pierre	`` i beg no pardons ; but i may be sorry . mr. falsgrave , my son , standing publicly plighted to lucy tartan , has privately wedded some other girl -- some slut ! '' `` impossible ! '' `` true as thou art there . thou knowest nothing of it then ? ''
melville	pierre	`` nothing , nothing -- not one grain till now . who is it he has wedded ? '' `` some _slut_ , i tell thee ! -- i am no lady now , but something deeper , -- a woman ! -- an outraged and pride-poisoned woman ! '' she turned from him swiftly , and again paced the room , as frantic and entirely regardless of any presence . waiting for her to pause , but in vain , mr. falsgrave advanced toward her cautiously , and with the profoundest deference , which was almost a cringing , spoke : --
melville	pierre	`` it is the hour of woe to thee ; and i confess my cloth hath no consolation for thee yet awhile . permit me to withdraw from thee , leaving my best prayers for thee , that thou mayst know some peace , ere this now shut-out sun goes down . send for me whenever thou desirest me. -- may i go now ? ''
melville	pierre	`` begone ! and let me not hear thy soft , mincing voice , which is an infamy to a man ! begone , thou helpless , and unhelping one ! '' she swiftly paced the room again , swiftly muttering to herself . `` now , now , now , now i see it clearer , clearer -- clear now as day ! my first dim suspicions pointed right ! -- too right ! ay -- the sewing ! it was the sewing ! -- the shriek ! -- i saw him gazing rooted at her . he would not speak going home with me . i charged him with his silence ; he put me off with lies , lies , lies ! ay , ay , he is married to her , to her ; -- to her ! -- perhaps was then . and yet , -- and yet , -- how can it be ? -- lucy , lucy -- i saw him , after that , look on her as if he would be glad to die for her , and go to hell for her , whither he deserves to go ! -- oh ! oh ! oh ! thus ruthlessly to cut off , at one gross sensual dash , the fair succession of an honorable race ! mixing the choicest wine with filthy water from the plebeian pool , and so turning all to undistinguishable rankness ! -- oh viper ! had i thee now in me , i would be a suicide and a murderer with one blow ! ''
melville	pierre	a third knock was at the door . she opened it . `` my mistress , i thought it would disturb you , -- it is so just overhead , -- so i have not removed them yet . '' `` unravel thy gibberish ! -- what is it ? ''
melville	pierre	`` pardon , my mistress , i somehow thought you knew it , but you can not . '' `` what is that writing crumpling in thy hand ? give it me . '' `` i have promised my young master not to , my mistress . ''
melville	pierre	`` i will snatch it , then , and so leave thee blameless. -- what ? what ? what ? -- he 's mad sure ! -- 'fine old fellow dates ' -- what ? what ? -- mad and merry ! -- chest ? -- clothes ? -- trunks ? -- he wants them ? -- tumble them out of his window ! -- and if he stand right beneath , tumble them out ! dismantle that whole room . tear up the carpet . i swear , he shall leave no smallest vestige in this house. -- here ! this very spot -- here , here , where i stand , he may have stood upon ; -- yes , he tied my shoe-string here ; it 's slippery ! dates ! ''
melville	pierre	`` my mistress . '' `` do his bidding . by reflection he has made me infamous to the world ; and i will make him infamous to it . listen , and do not delude thyself that i am crazy . go up to yonder room '' ( pointing upward ) , `` and remove every article in it , and where he bid thee set down the chest and trunks , there set down all the contents of that room . ''
melville	pierre	`` 't was before the house -- this house ! '' `` and if it had not been there , i would not order thee to put them there . dunce ! i would have the world know that i disown and scorn him ! do my bidding ! -- stay . let the room stand ; but take him what he asks for . ''
melville	pierre	`` i will , my mistress . '' as dates left the chamber , mrs. glendinning again paced it swiftly , and again swiftly muttered : `` now , if i were less a strong and haughty woman , the fit would have gone by ere now . but deep volcanoes long burn , ere they burn out. -- oh , that the world were made of such malleable stuff , that we could recklessly do our fieriest heart's-wish before it , and not falter . accursed be those four syllables of sound which make up that vile word propriety . it is a chain and bell to drag ; -- drag ? what sound is that ? there 's dragging -- his trunks -- the traveler 's -- dragging out . oh would i could so drag my heart , as fishers for the drowned do , as that i might drag up my sunken happiness ! boy ! boy ! worse than brought in dripping drowned to me , -- drowned in icy infamy ! oh ! oh ! oh ! ''
melville	pierre	she threw herself upon the bed , covered her face , and lay motionless . but suddenly rose again , and hurriedly rang the bell . `` open that desk , and draw the stand to me . now wait and take this to miss lucy . ''
melville	pierre	with a pencil she rapidly traced these lines : -- `` my heart bleeds for thee , sweet lucy . i can not speak -- i know it all . look for me the first hour i regain myself . ''
melville	pierre	again she threw herself upon the bed , and lay motionless . iii . toward sundown that evening , pierre stood in one of the three bespoken chambers in the black swan inn ; the blue chintz-covered chest and the writing-desk before him . his hands were eagerly searching through his pockets .
melville	pierre	`` the key ! the key ! nay , then , i must force it open . it bodes ill , too . yet lucky is it , some bankers can break into their own vaults , when other means do fail . not so , ever . let me see : -- yes , the tongs there . now then for the sweet sight of gold and silver . i never loved it till this day . how long it has been hoarded ; -- little token pieces , of years ago , from aunts , uncles , cousins innumerable , and from -- but i wo n't mention _them_ ; dead henceforth to me ! sure there 'll be a premium on such ancient gold . there 's some broad bits , token pieces to my -- i name him not -- more than half a century ago . well , well , i never thought to cast them back into the sordid circulations whence they came . but if they must be spent , now is the time , in this last necessity , and in this sacred cause . 't is a most stupid , dunderheaded crowbar . hoy ! so ! ah , now for it : -- snake 's nest ! ''
melville	pierre	forced suddenly back , the chest-lid had as suddenly revealed to him the chair-portrait lying on top of all the rest , where he had secreted it some days before . face up , it met him with its noiseless , ever-nameless , and ambiguous , unchanging smile . now his first repugnance was augmented by an emotion altogether new . that certain lurking lineament in the portrait , whose strange transfer blended with far other , and sweeter , and nobler characteristics , was visible in the countenance of isabel ; that lineament in the portrait was somehow now detestable ; nay , altogether loathsome , ineffably so , to pierre . he argued not with himself why this was so ; he only felt it , and most keenly .
melville	pierre	omitting more subtile inquisition into this deftly-winding theme , it will be enough to hint , perhaps , that possibly one source of this new hatefulness had its primary and unconscious rise in one of those profound ideas , which at times atmospherically , as it were , do insinuate themselves even into very ordinary minds . in the strange relativeness , reciprocalness , and transmittedness , between the long-dead father 's portrait , and the living daughter 's face , pierre might have seemed to see reflected to him , by visible and uncontradictable symbols , the tyranny of time and fate . painted before the daughter was conceived or born , like a dumb seer , the portrait still seemed leveling its prophetic finger at that empty air , from which isabel did finally emerge . there seemed to lurk some mystical intelligence and vitality in the picture ; because , since in his own memory of his father , pierre could not recall any distinct lineament transmitted to isabel , but vaguely saw such in the portrait ; therefore , not pierre 's parent , as any way rememberable by him , but the portrait 's painted _self_ seemed the real father of isabel ; for , so far as all sense went , isabel had inherited one peculiar trait no-whither traceable but to it .
melville	pierre	and as his father was now sought to be banished from his mind , as a most bitter presence there , but isabel was become a thing of intense and fearful love for him ; therefore , it was loathsome to him , that in the smiling and ambiguous portrait , her sweet mournful image should be so sinisterly becrooked , bemixed , and mutilated to him .
melville	pierre	when , the first shock , and then the pause were over , he lifted the portrait in his two hands , and held it averted from him . `` it shall not live . hitherto i have hoarded up mementoes and monuments of the past ; been a worshiper of all heirlooms ; a fond filer away of letters , locks of hair , bits of ribbon , flowers , and the thousand-and-one minutenesses which love and memory think they sanctify : -- but it is forever over now ! if to me any memory shall henceforth be dear , i will not mummy it in a visible memorial for every passing beggar 's dust to gather on . love 's museum is vain and foolish as the catacombs , where grinning apes and abject lizards are embalmed , as , forsooth , significant of some imagined charm . it speaks merely of decay and death , and nothing more ; decay and death of endless innumerable generations ; it makes of earth one mold . how can lifelessness be fit memorial of life ? -- so far , for mementoes of the sweetest . as for the rest -- now i know this , that in commonest memorials , the twilight fact of death first discloses in some secret way , all the ambiguities of that departed thing or person ; obliquely it casts hints , and insinuates surmises base , and eternally incapable of being cleared . decreed by god omnipotent it is , that death should be the last scene of the last act of man 's play ; -- a play , which begin how it may , in farce or comedy , ever hath its tragic end ; the curtain inevitably falls upon a corpse . therefore , never more will i play the vile pigmy , and by small memorials after death , attempt to reverse the decree of death , by essaying the poor perpetuating of the image of the original . let all die , and mix again ! as for this -- this ! -- why longer should i preserve it ? why preserve that on which one can not patient look ? if i am resolved to hold his public memory inviolate , -- destroy this thing ; for here is the one great , condemning , and unsuborned proof , whose mysticalness drives me half mad. -- of old greek times , before man 's brain went into doting bondage , and bleached and beaten in baconian fulling-mills , his four limbs lost their barbaric tan and beauty ; when the round world was fresh , and rosy , and spicy , as a new-plucked apple ; -- all 's wilted now ! -- in those bold times , the great dead were not , turkey-like , dished in trenchers , and set down all garnished in the ground , to glut the damned cyclop like a cannibal ; but nobly envious life cheated the glutton worm , and gloriously burned the corpse ; so that the spirit up-pointed , and visibly forked to heaven !
melville	pierre	`` so now will i serve thee . though that solidity of which thou art the unsolid duplicate , hath long gone to its hideous church-yard account ; -- and though , god knows ! but for one part of thee it may have been fit auditing ; -- yet will i now a second time see thy obsequies performed , and by now burning thee , urn thee in the great vase of air ! come now ! ''
melville	pierre	a small wood-fire had been kindled on the hearth to purify the long-closed room ; it was now diminished to a small pointed heap of glowing embers . detaching and dismembering the gilded but tarnished frame , pierre laid the four pieces on the coals ; as their dryness soon caught the sparks , he rolled the reversed canvas into a scroll , and tied it , and committed it to the now crackling , clamorous flames . steadfastly pierre watched the first crispings and blackenings of the painted scroll , but started as suddenly unwinding from the burnt string that had tied it , for one swift instant , seen through the flame and smoke , the upwrithing portrait tormentedly stared at him in beseeching horror , and then , wrapped in one broad sheet of oily fire , disappeared forever .
melville	pierre	yielding to a sudden ungovernable impulse , pierre darted his hand among the flames , to rescue the imploring face ; but as swiftly drew back his scorched and bootless grasp . his hand was burnt and blackened , but he did not heed it .
melville	pierre	he ran back to the chest , and seizing repeated packages of family letters , and all sorts of miscellaneous memorials in paper , he threw them one after the other upon the fire .
melville	pierre	`` thus , and thus , and thus ! on thy manes i fling fresh spoils ; pour out all my memory in one libation ! -- so , so , so -- lower , lower , lower ; now all is done , and all is ashes ! henceforth , cast-out pierre hath no paternity , and no past ; and since the future is one blank to all ; therefore , twice-disinherited pierre stands untrammeledly his ever-present self ! -- free to do his own self-will and present fancy to whatever end ! ''
melville	pierre	iv . that same sunset lucy lay in her chamber . a knock was heard at its door , and the responding martha was met by the now self-controlled and resolute face of mrs. glendinning .
melville	pierre	`` how is your young mistress , martha ? may i come in ? '' but waiting for no answer , with the same breath she passed the maid , and determinately entered the room . she sat down by the bed , and met the open eye , but closed and pallid mouth of lucy . she gazed rivetedly and inquisitively a moment ; then turned a quick aghast look toward martha , as if seeking warrant for some shuddering thought .
melville	pierre	`` miss lucy '' -- said martha -- '' it is your -- it is mrs. glendinning . speak to her , miss lucy . '' as if left in the last helpless attitude of some spent contortion of her grief , lucy was not lying in the ordinary posture of one in bed , but lay half crosswise upon it , with the pale pillows propping her hueless form , and but a single sheet thrown over her , as though she were so heart overladen , that her white body could not bear one added feather . and as in any snowy marble statue , the drapery clings to the limbs ; so as one found drowned , the thin , defining sheet invested lucy .
melville	pierre	`` it is mrs. glendinning . will you speak to her , miss lucy ? '' the thin lips moved and trembled for a moment , and then were still again , and augmented pallor shrouded her .
melville	pierre	martha brought restoratives ; and when all was as before , she made a gesture for the lady to depart , and in a whisper , said , `` she will not speak to any ; she does not speak to me . the doctor has just left -- he has been here five times since morning -- and says she must be kept entirely quiet . '' then pointing to the stand , added , `` you see what he has left -- mere restoratives . quiet is her best medicine now , he says . quiet , quiet , quiet ! oh , sweet quiet , wilt thou now ever come ? ''
melville	pierre	`` has mrs. tartan been written to ? '' whispered the lady . martha nodded . so the lady moved to quit the room , saying that once every two hours she would send to know how lucy fared .
melville	pierre	`` but where , where is her aunt , martha ? '' she exclaimed , lowly , pausing at the door , and glancing in sudden astonishment about the room ; `` surely , surely , mrs. lanyllyn -- '' `` poor , poor old lady , '' weepingly whispered martha , `` she hath caught infection from sweet lucy 's woe ; she hurried hither , caught one glimpse of that bed , and fell like dead upon the floor . the doctor hath two patients now , lady '' -- glancing at the bed , and tenderly feeling lucy 's bosom , to mark if yet it heaved ; `` alack ! alack ! oh , reptile ! reptile ! that could sting so sweet a breast ! fire would be too cold for him -- accursed ! ''
melville	pierre	`` thy own tongue blister the roof of thy mouth ! '' cried mrs. glendinning , in a half-stifled , whispering scream . `` 't is not for thee , hired one , to rail at my son , though he were lucifer , simmering in hell ! mend thy manners , minx ! ''
melville	pierre	and she left the chamber , dilated with her unconquerable pride , leaving martha aghast at such venom in such beauty . book xiii . they depart the meadows . i . it was just dusk when pierre approached the ulver farm-house , in a wagon belonging to the black swan inn . he met his sister shawled and bonneted in the porch .
melville	pierre	`` now then , isabel , is all ready ? where is delly ? i see two most small and inconsiderable portmanteaux . wee is the chest that holds the goods of the disowned ! the wagon waits , isabel . now is all ready ? and nothing left ? ''
melville	pierre	`` nothing , pierre ; unless in going hence -- but i 'll not think of that ; all 's fated . '' `` delly ! where is she ? let us go in for her , '' said pierre , catching the hand of isabel , and turning rapidly . as he thus half dragged her into the little lighted entry , and then dropping her hand , placed his touch on the catch of the inner door , isabel stayed his arm , as if to keep him back , till she should forewarn him against something concerning delly ; but suddenly she started herself ; and for one instant , eagerly pointing at his right hand , seemed almost to half shrink from pierre .
melville	pierre	`` 't is nothing . i am not hurt ; a slight burn -- the merest accidental scorch this morning . but what 's this ? '' he added , lifting his hand higher ; `` smoke ! soot ! this comes of going in the dark ; sunlight , and i had seen it . but i have not touched thee , isabel ? ''
melville	pierre	isabel lifted her hand and showed the marks. -- '' but it came from thee , my brother ; and i would catch the plague from thee , so that it should make me share thee . do thou clean thy hand ; let mine alone . ''
melville	pierre	`` delly ! delly ! '' -- cried pierre -- '' why may i not go to her , to bring her forth ? '' placing her finger upon her lip , isabel softly opened the door , and showed the object of his inquiry avertedly seated , muffled , on a chair .
melville	pierre	`` do not speak to her , my brother , '' whispered isabel , `` and do not seek to behold her face , as yet . it will pass over now , ere long , i trust . come , shall we go now ? take delly forth , but do not speak to her . i have bidden all good-by ; the old people are in yonder room in the rear ; i am glad that they chose not to come out , to attend our going forth . come now , be very quick , pierre ; this is an hour i like not ; be it swiftly past . ''
melville	pierre	soon all three alighted at the inn . ordering lights , pierre led the way above-stairs , and ushered his two companions into one of the two outermost rooms of the three adjoining chambers prepared for all .
melville	pierre	`` see , '' said he , to the mute and still self-averting figure of delly ; -- '' see , this is thy room , miss ulver ; isabel has told thee all ; thou know'st our till now secret marriage ; she will stay with thee now , till i return from a little business down the street . to-morrow , thou know'st , very early , we take the stage . i may not see thee again till then , so , be steadfast , and cheer up a very little , miss ulver , and good-night . all will be well . ''
melville	pierre	ii . next morning , by break of day , at four o'clock , the four swift hours were personified in four impatient horses , which shook their trappings beneath the windows of the inn . three figures emerged into the cool dim air and took their places in the coach .
melville	pierre	the old landlord had silently and despondently shaken pierre by the hand ; the vainglorious driver was on his box , threadingly adjusting the four reins among the fingers of his buck-skin gloves ; the usual thin company of admiring ostlers and other early on-lookers were gathered about the porch ; when -- on his companions ' account -- all eager to cut short any vain delay , at such a painful crisis , pierre impetuously shouted for the coach to move . in a moment , the four meadow-fed young horses leaped forward their own generous lengths , and the four responsive wheels rolled their complete circles ; while making vast rearward flourishes with his whip , the elated driver seemed as a bravado-hero signing his ostentatious farewell signature in the empty air . and so , in the dim of the dawn -- and to the defiant crackings of that long and sharp-resounding whip , the three forever fled the sweet fields of saddle meadows .
melville	pierre	the short old landlord gazed after the coach awhile , and then re-entering the inn , stroked his gray beard and muttered to himself : -- '' i have kept this house , now , three-and-thirty years , and have had plenty of bridal-parties come and go ; in their long train of wagons , break-downs , buggies , gigs -- a gay and giggling train -- ha ! -- there 's a pun ! popt out like a cork -- ay , and once in ox-carts , all garlanded ; ay , and once , the merry bride was bedded on a load of sweet-scented new-cut clover . but such a bridal-party as this morning 's -- why , it 's as sad as funerals . and brave master pierre glendinning is the groom ! well , well , wonders is all the go . i thought i had done with wondering when i passed fifty ; but i keep wondering still . ah , somehow , now , i feel as though i had just come from lowering some old friend beneath the sod , and yet felt the grating cord-marks in my palms. -- 't is early , but i 'll drink . let 's see ; cider , -- a mug of cider ; -- 't is sharp , and pricks like a game-cock 's spur , -- cider 's the drink for grief . oh , lord ! that fat men should be so thin-skinned , and suffer in pure sympathy on others ' account . a thin-skinned , thin man , he do n't suffer so , because there ai n't so much stuff in him for his thin skin to cover . well , well , well , well , well ; of all colics , save me from the melloncholics ; green melons is the greenest thing ! ''
melville	pierre	book xiv . the journey and the pamphlet . i . all profound things , and emotions of things are preceded and attended by silence . what a silence is that with which the pale bride precedes the responsive _i will_ , to the priest 's solemn question , _wilt thou have this man for thy husband ? _ in silence , too , the wedded hands are clasped . yea , in silence the child christ was born into the world . silence is the general consecration of the universe . silence is the invisible laying on of the divine pontiff 's hands upon the world . silence is at once the most harmless and the most awful thing in all nature . it speaks of the reserved forces of fate . silence is the only voice of our god .
melville	pierre	nor is this so august silence confined to things simply touching or grand . like the air , silence permeates all things , and produces its magical power , as well during that peculiar mood which prevails at a solitary traveler 's first setting forth on a journey , as at the unimaginable time when before the world was , silence brooded on the face of the waters .
melville	pierre	no word was spoken by its inmates , as the coach bearing our young enthusiast , pierre , and his mournful party , sped forth through the dim dawn into the deep midnight , which still occupied , unrepulsed , the hearts of the old woods through which the road wound , very shortly after quitting the village .
melville	pierre	when first entering the coach , pierre had pressed his hand upon the cushioned seat to steady his way , some crumpled leaves of paper had met his fingers . he had instinctively clutched them ; and the same strange clutching mood of his soul which had prompted that instinctive act , did also prevail in causing him now to retain the crumpled paper in his hand for an hour or more of that wonderful intense silence , which the rapid coach bore through the heart of the general stirless morning silence of the fields and the woods .
melville	pierre	his thoughts were very dark and wild ; for a space there was rebellion and horrid anarchy and infidelity in his soul . this temporary mood may best be likened to that , which -- according to a singular story once told in the pulpit by a reverend man of god -- invaded the heart of an excellent priest . in the midst of a solemn cathedral , upon a cloudy sunday afternoon , this priest was in the act of publicly administering the bread at the holy sacrament of the supper , when the evil one suddenly propounded to him the possibility of the mere moonshine of the christian religion . just such now was the mood of pierre ; to him the evil one propounded the possibility of the mere moonshine of all his self-renouncing enthusiasm . the evil one hooted at him , and called him a fool . but by instant and earnest prayer -- closing his two eyes , with his two hands still holding the sacramental bread -- the devout priest had vanquished the impious devil . not so with pierre . the imperishable monument of his holy catholic church ; the imperishable record of his holy bible ; the imperishable intuition of the innate truth of christianity ; -- these were the indestructible anchors which still held the priest to his firm faith 's rock , when the sudden storm raised by the evil one assailed him . but pierre -- where could _he_ find the church , the monument , the bible , which unequivocally said to him -- '' go on ; thou art in the right ; i endorse thee all over ; go on . '' -- so the difference between the priest and pierre was herein : -- with the priest it was a matter , whether certain bodiless thoughts of his were true or not true ; but with pierre it was a question whether certain vital acts of his were right or wrong . in this little nut lie germ-like the possible solution of some puzzling problems ; and also the discovery of additional , and still more profound problems ensuing upon the solution of the former . for so true is this last , that some men refuse to solve any present problem , for fear of making still more work for themselves in that way .
melville	pierre	now , pierre thought of the magical , mournful letter of isabel , he recalled the divine inspiration of that hour when the heroic words burst from his heart -- '' comfort thee , and stand by thee , and fight for thee , will thy leapingly-acknowledging brother ! '' these remembrances unfurled themselves in proud exultations in his soul ; and from before such glorious banners of virtue , the club-footed evil one limped away in dismay . but now the dread , fateful parting look of his mother came over him ; anew he heard the heart-proscribing words -- '' beneath my roof and at my table , he who was once pierre glendinning no more puts himself ; '' -- swooning in her snow-white bed , the lifeless lucy lay before him , wrapt as in the reverberating echoings of her own agonizing shriek : `` my heart ! my heart ! '' then how swift the recurrence to isabel , and the nameless awfulness of his still imperfectly conscious , incipient , new-mingled emotion toward this mysterious being . `` lo ! i leave corpses wherever i go ! '' groaned pierre to himself -- '' can then my conduct be right ? lo ! by my conduct i seem threatened by the possibility of a sin anomalous and accursed , so anomalous , it may well be the one for which scripture says , there is never forgiveness . corpses behind me , and the last sin before , how then can my conduct be right ? ''
melville	pierre	in this mood , the silence accompanied him , and the first visible rays of the morning sun in this same mood found him and saluted him . the excitement and the sleepless night just passed , and the strange narcotic of a quiet , steady anguish , and the sweet quiescence of the air , and the monotonous cradle-like motion of the coach over a road made firm and smooth by a refreshing shower over night ; these had wrought their wonted effect upon isabel and delly ; with hidden faces they leaned fast asleep in pierre 's sight . fast asleep -- thus unconscious , oh sweet isabel , oh forlorn delly , your swift destinies i bear in my own !
melville	pierre	suddenly , as his sad eye fell lower and lower from scanning their magically quiescent persons , his glance lit upon his own clutched hand , which rested on his knee . some paper protruded from that clutch . he knew not how it had got there , or whence it had come , though himself had closed his own gripe upon it . he lifted his hand and slowly unfingered and unbolted the paper , and unrolled it , and carefully smoothed it , to see what it might be .
melville	pierre	it was a thin , tattered , dried-fish-like thing ; printed with blurred ink upon mean , sleazy paper . it seemed the opening pages of some ruinous old pamphlet -- a pamphlet containing a chapter or so of some very voluminous disquisition . the conclusion was gone . it must have been accidentally left there by some previous traveler , who perhaps in drawing out his handkerchief , had ignorantly extracted his waste paper .
melville	pierre	there is a singular infatuation in most men , which leads them in odd moments , intermitting between their regular occupations , and when they find themselves all alone in some quiet corner or nook , to fasten with unaccountable fondness upon the merest rag of old printed paper -- some shred of a long-exploded advertisement perhaps -- and read it , and study it , and reread it , and pore over it , and fairly agonize themselves over this miserable , sleazy paper-rag , which at any other time , or in any other place , they would hardly touch with st. dunstan 's long tongs . so now , in a degree , with pierre . but notwithstanding that he , with most other human beings , shared in the strange hallucination above mentioned , yet the first glimpse of the title of the dried-fish-like , pamphlet-shaped rag , did almost tempt him to pitch it out of the window . for , be a man 's mood what it may , what sensible and ordinary mortal could have patience for any considerable period , to knowingly hold in his conscious hand a printed document ( and that too a very blurred one as to ink , and a very sleazy one as to paper ) , so metaphysically and insufferably entitled as this : -- '' chronometricals & horologicals ? ''
melville	pierre	doubtless , it was something vastly profound ; but it is to be observed , that when a man is in a really profound mood , then all merely verbal or written profundities are unspeakably repulsive , and seem downright childish to him . nevertheless , the silence still continued ; the road ran through an almost unplowed and uninhabited region ; the slumberers still slumbered before him ; the evil mood was becoming well nigh insupportable to him ; so , more to force his mind away from the dark realities of things than from any other motive , pierre finally tried his best to plunge himself into the pamphlet .
melville	pierre	ii . sooner or later in this life , the earnest , or enthusiastic youth comes to know , and more or less appreciate this startling solecism : -- that while , as the grand condition of acceptance to god , christianity calls upon all men to renounce this world ; yet by all odds the most mammonish part of this world -- europe and america -- are owned by none but professed christian nations , who glory in the owning , and seem to have some reason therefor .
melville	pierre	this solecism once vividly and practically apparent ; then comes the earnest reperusal of the gospels : the intense self-absorption into that greatest real miracle of all religions , the sermon on the mount . from that divine mount , to all earnest loving youths , flows an inexhaustible soul-melting stream of tenderness and loving-kindness ; and they leap exulting to their feet , to think that the founder of their holy religion gave utterance to sentences so infinitely sweet and soothing as these sentences which embody all the love of the past , and all the love which can be imagined in any conceivable future . such emotions as that sermon raises in the enthusiastic heart ; such emotions all youthful hearts refuse to ascribe to humanity as their origin . this is of god ! cries the heart , and in that cry ceases all inquisition . now , with this fresh-read sermon in his soul , the youth again gazes abroad upon the world . instantly , in aggravation of the former solecism , an overpowering sense of the world 's downright positive falsity comes over him ; the world seems to lie saturated and soaking with lies . the sense of this thing is so overpowering , that at first the youth is apt to refuse the evidence of his own senses ; even as he does that same evidence in the matter of the movement of the visible sun in the heavens , which with his own eyes he plainly sees to go round the world , but nevertheless on the authority of other persons , -- the copernican astronomers , whom he never saw -- he believes it _not_ to go round the world , but the world round it . just so , too , he hears good and wise people sincerely say : this world only _seems_ to be saturated and soaking with lies ; but in reality it does not so lie soaking and saturate ; along with some lies , there is much truth in this world . but again he refers to his bible , and there he reads most explicitly , that this world is unconditionally depraved and accursed ; and that at all hazards men must come out of it . but why come out of it , if it be a true world and not a lying world ? assuredly , then , this world is a lie .
melville	pierre	hereupon then in the soul of the enthusiast youth two armies come to the shock ; and unless he prove recreant , or unless he prove gullible , or unless he can find the talismanic secret , to reconcile this world with his own soul , then there is no peace for him , no slightest truce for him in this life . now without doubt this talismanic secret has never yet been found ; and in the nature of human things it seems as though it never can be . certain philosophers have time and again pretended to have found it ; but if they do not in the end discover their own delusion , other people soon discover it for themselves , and so those philosophers and their vain philosophy are let glide away into practical oblivion . plato , and spinoza , and goethe , and many more belong to this guild of self-impostors , with a preposterous rabble of muggletonian scots and yankees , whose vile brogue still the more bestreaks the stripedness of their greek or german neoplatonical originals . that profound silence , that only voice of our god , which i before spoke of ; from that divine thing without a name , those impostor philosophers pretend somehow to have got an answer ; which is as absurd , as though they should say they had got water out of stone ; for how can a man get a voice out of silence ?
melville	pierre	certainly , all must admit , that if for any one this problem of the possible reconcilement of this world with our own souls possessed a peculiar and potential interest , that one was pierre glendinning at the period we now write of . for in obedience to the loftiest behest of his soul , he had done certain vital acts , which had already lost him his worldly felicity , and which he felt must in the end indirectly work him some still additional and not-to-be-thought-of woe .
melville	pierre	soon then , as after his first distaste at the mystical title , and after his then reading on , merely to drown himself , pierre at last began to obtain a glimmering into the profound intent of the writer of the sleazy rag pamphlet , he felt a great interest awakened in him . the more he read and re-read , the more this interest deepened , but still the more likewise did his failure to comprehend the writer increase . he seemed somehow to derive some general vague inkling concerning it , but the central conceit refused to become clear to him . the reason whereof is not so easy to be laid down ; seeing that the reason-originating heart and mind of man , these organic things themselves are not so easily to be expounded . something , however , more or less to the point , may be adventured here .
melville	pierre	if a man be in any vague latent doubt about the intrinsic correctness and excellence of his general life-theory and practical course of life ; then , if that man chance to light on any other man , or any little treatise , or sermon , which unintendingly , as it were , yet very palpably illustrates to him the intrinsic incorrectness and non-excellence of both the theory and the practice of his life ; then that man will -- more or less unconsciously -- try hard to hold himself back from the self-admitted comprehension of a matter which thus condemns him . for in this case , to comprehend , is himself to condemn himself , which is always highly inconvenient and uncomfortable to a man . again . if a man be told a thing wholly new , then -- during the time of its first announcement to him -- it is entirely impossible for him to comprehend it . for -- absurd as it may seem -- men are only made to comprehend things which they comprehended before ( though but in the embryo , as it were ) . things new it is impossible to make them comprehend , by merely talking to them about it . true , sometimes they pretend to comprehend ; in their own hearts they really believe they do comprehend ; outwardly look as though they _did_ comprehend ; wag their bushy tails comprehendingly ; but for all that , they do not comprehend . possibly , they may afterward come , of themselves , to inhale this new idea from the circumambient air , and so come to comprehend it ; but not otherwise at all . it will be observed , that , neither points of the above speculations do we , in set terms , attribute to pierre in connection with the rag pamphlet . possibly both might be applicable ; possibly neither . certain it is , however , that at the time , in his own heart , he seemed to think that he did not fully comprehend the strange writer 's conceit in all its bearings . yet was this conceit apparently one of the plainest in the world ; so natural , a child might almost have originated it . nevertheless , again so profound , that scarce juggularius himself could be the author ; and still again so exceedingly trivial , that juggularius ' smallest child might well have been ashamed of it .
melville	pierre	seeing then that this curious paper rag so puzzled pierre ; foreseeing , too , that pierre may not in the end be entirely uninfluenced in his conduct by the torn pamphlet , when afterwards perhaps by other means he shall come to understand it ; or , peradventure , come to know that he , in the first place , did -- seeing too that the author thereof came to be made known to him by reputation , and though pierre never spoke to him , yet exerted a surprising sorcery upon his spirit by the mere distant glimpse of his countenance ; -- all these reasons i account sufficient apology for inserting in the following chapters the initial part of what seems to me a very fanciful and mystical , rather than philosophical lecture , from which , i confess , that i myself can derive no conclusion which permanently satisfies those peculiar motions in my soul , to which that lecture seems more particularly addressed . for to me it seems more the excellently illustrated re-statement of a problem , than the solution of the problem itself . but as such mere illustrations are almost universally taken for solutions ( and perhaps they are the only possible human solutions ) , therefore it may help to the temporary quiet of some inquiring mind ; and so not be wholly without use . at the worst , each person can now skip , or read and rail for himself .
melville	pierre	iii . `` _ei_ , '' by plotinus plinlimmon , ( _in three hundred and thirty-three lectures._ ) lecture first . chronometricals and horologicals , ( _being not to much the portal , as part of the temporary scaffold to the portal of this new philosophy._ )
melville	pierre	`` few of us doubt , gentlemen , that human life on this earth is but a state of probation ; which among other things implies , that here below , we mortals have only to do with things provisional . accordingly , i hold that all our so-called wisdom is likewise but provisional .
melville	pierre	`` this preamble laid down , i begin . `` it seems to me , in my visions , that there is a certain most rare order of human souls , which if carefully carried in the body will almost always and everywhere give heaven 's own truth , with some small grains of variance . for peculiarly coming from god , the sole source of that heavenly truth , and the great greenwich hill and tower from which the universal meridians are far out into infinity reckoned ; such souls seem as london sea-chronometers ( _greek_ , time-namers ) which as the london ship floats past greenwich down the thames , are accurately adjusted by greenwich time , and if heedfully kept , will still give that same time , even though carried to the azores . true , in nearly all cases of long , remote voyages -- to china , say -- chronometers of the best make , and the most carefully treated , will gradually more or less vary from greenwich time , without the possibility of the error being corrected by direct comparison with their great standard ; but skillful and devout observations of the stars by the sextant will serve materially to lessen such errors . and besides , there is such a thing as _rating_ a chronometer ; that is , having ascertained its degree of organic inaccuracy , however small , then in all subsequent chronometrical calculations , that ascertained loss or gain can be readily added or deducted , as the case may be . then again , on these long voyages , the chronometer may be corrected by comparing it with the chronometer of some other ship at sea , more recently from home .
melville	pierre	`` now in an artificial world like ours , the soul of man is further removed from its god and the heavenly truth , than the chronometer carried to china , is from greenwich . and , as that chronometer , if at all accurate , will pronounce it to be 12 o'clock high-noon , when the china local watches say , perhaps , it is 12 o'clock midnight ; so the chronometric soul , if in this world true to its great greenwich in the other , will always , in its so-called intuitions of right and wrong , be contradicting the mere local standards and watch-maker 's brains of this earth .
melville	pierre	`` bacon 's brains were mere watch-maker 's brains ; but christ was a chronometer ; and the most exquisitely adjusted and exact one , and the least affected by all terrestrial jarrings , of any that have ever come to us . and the reason why his teachings seemed folly to the jews , was because he carried that heaven 's time in jerusalem , while the jews carried jerusalem time there . did he not expressly say -- my wisdom ( time ) is not of this world ? but whatever is really peculiar in the wisdom of christ seems precisely the same folly to-day as it did 1850 years ago . because , in all that interval his bequeathed chronometer has still preserved its original heaven 's time , and the general jerusalem of this world has likewise carefully preserved its own .
melville	pierre	`` but though the chronometer carried from greenwich to china , should truly exhibit in china what the time may be at greenwich at any moment ; yet , though thereby it must necessarily contradict china time , it does by no means thence follow , that with respect to china , the china watches are at all out of the way . precisely the reverse . for the fact of that variance is a presumption that , with respect to china , the chinese watches must be all right ; and consequently as the china watches are right as to china , so the greenwich chronometers must be wrong as to china . besides , of what use to the chinaman would a greenwich chronometer , keeping greenwich time , be ? were he thereby to regulate his daily actions , he would be guilty of all manner of absurdities : -- going to bed at noon , say , when his neighbors would be sitting down to dinner . and thus , though the earthly wisdom of man be heavenly folly to god ; so also , conversely , is the heavenly wisdom of god an earthly folly to man . literally speaking , this is so . nor does the god at the heavenly greenwich expect common men to keep greenwich wisdom in this remote chinese world of ours ; because such a thing were unprofitable for them here , and , indeed , a falsification of himself , inasmuch as in that case , china time would be identical with greenwich time , which would make greenwich time wrong .
melville	pierre	`` but why then does god now and then send a heavenly chronometer ( as a meteoric stone ) into the world , uselessly as it would seem , to give the lie to all the world 's time-keepers ? because he is unwilling to leave man without some occasional testimony to this : -- that though man 's chinese notions of things may answer well enough here , they are by no means universally applicable , and that the central greenwich in which he dwells goes by a somewhat different method from this world . and yet it follows not from this , that god 's truth is one thing and man 's truth another ; but -- as above hinted , and as will be further elucidated in subsequent lectures -- by their very contradictions they are made to correspond .
melville	pierre	`` by inference it follows , also , that he who finding in himself a chronometrical soul , seeks practically to force that heavenly time upon the earth ; in such an attempt he can never succeed , with an absolute and essential success . and as for himself , if he seek to regulate his own daily conduct by it , he will but array all men 's earthly time-keepers against him , and thereby work himself woe and death . both these things are plainly evinced in the character and fate of christ , and the past and present condition of the religion he taught . but here one thing is to be especially observed . though christ encountered woe in both the precept and the practice of his chronometricals , yet did he remain throughout entirely without folly or sin . whereas , almost invariably , with inferior beings , the absolute effort to live in this world according to the strict letter of the chronometricals is , somehow , apt to involve those inferior beings eventually in strange , _unique_ follies and sins , unimagined before . it is the story of the ephesian matron , allegorized .
melville	pierre	`` to any earnest man of insight , a faithful contemplation of these ideas concerning chronometricals and horologicals , will serve to render provisionally far less dark some few of the otherwise obscurest things which have hitherto tormented the honest-thinking men of all ages . what man who carries a heavenly soul in him , has not groaned to perceive , that unless he committed a sort of suicide as to the practical things of this world , he never can hope to regulate his earthly conduct by that same heavenly soul ? and yet by an infallible instinct he knows , that that monitor can not be wrong in itself .
melville	pierre	`` and where is the earnest and righteous philosopher , gentlemen , who looking right and left , and up and down , through all the ages of the world , the present included ; where is there such an one who has not a thousand times been struck with a sort of infidel idea , that whatever other worlds god may be lord of , he is not the lord of this ; for else this world would seem to give the lie to him ; so utterly repugnant seem its ways to the instinctively known ways of heaven . but it is not , and can not be so ; nor will he who regards this chronometrical conceit aright , ever more be conscious of that horrible idea . for he will then see , or seem to see , that this world 's seeming incompatibility with god , absolutely results from its meridianal correspondence with him .
melville	pierre	* * * * * `` this chronometrical conceit does by no means involve the justification of all the acts which wicked men may perform . for in their wickedness downright wicked men sin as much against their own horologes , as against the heavenly chronometer . that this is so , their spontaneous liability to remorse does plainly evince . no , this conceit merely goes to show , that for the mass of men , the highest abstract heavenly righteousness is not only impossible , but would be entirely out of place , and positively wrong in a world like this . to turn the left cheek if the right be smitten , is chronometrical ; hence , no average son of man ever did such a thing . to give _all_ that thou hast to the poor , this too is chronometrical ; hence no average son of man ever did such a thing . nevertheless , if a man gives with a certain self-considerate generosity to the poor ; abstains from doing downright ill to any man ; does his convenient best in a general way to do good to his whole race ; takes watchful loving care of his wife and children , relatives , and friends ; is perfectly tolerant to all other men 's opinions , whatever they may be ; is an honest dealer , an honest citizen , and all that ; and more especially if he believe that there is a god for infidels , as well as for believers , and acts upon that belief ; then , though such a man falls infinitely short of the chronometrical standard , though all his actions are entirely horologic ; -- yet such a man need never lastingly despond , because he is sometimes guilty of some minor offense : -- hasty words , impulsively returning a blow , fits of domestic petulance , selfish enjoyment of a glass of wine while he knows there are those around him who lack a loaf of bread . i say he need never lastingly despond on account of his perpetual liability to these things ; because _not_ to do them , and their like , would be to be an angel , a chronometer ; whereas , he is a man and a horologe .
melville	pierre	`` yet does the horologe itself teach , that all liabilities to these things should be checked as much as possible , though it is certain they can never be utterly eradicated . they are only to be checked , then , because , if entirely unrestrained , they would finally run into utter selfishness and human demonism , which , as before hinted , are not by any means justified by the horologe .
melville	pierre	`` in short , this chronometrical and horological conceit , in sum , seems to teach this : -- that in things terrestrial ( horological ) a man must not be governed by ideas celestial ( chronometrical ) ; that certain minor self-renunciations in this life his own mere instinct for his own every-day general well-being will teach him to make , but he must by no means make a complete unconditional sacrifice of himself in behalf of any other being , or any cause , or any conceit . ( for , does aught else completely and unconditionally sacrifice itself for him ? god 's own sun does not abate one tittle of its heat in july , however you swoon with that heat in the sun . and if it _did_ abate its heat on your behalf , then the wheat and the rye would not ripen ; and so , for the incidental benefit of one , a whole population would suffer . )
melville	pierre	`` a virtuous expediency , then , seems the highest desirable or attainable earthly excellence for the mass of men , and is the only earthly excellence that their creator intended for them . when they go to heaven , it will be quite another thing . there , they can freely turn the left cheek , because there the right cheek will never be smitten . there they can freely give all to the poor , for _there_ there will be no poor to give to . a due appreciation of this matter will do good to man . for , hitherto , being authoritatively taught by his dogmatical teachers that he must , while on earth , aim at heaven , and attain it , too , in all his earthly acts , on pain of eternal wrath ; and finding by experience that this is utterly impossible ; in his despair , he is too apt to run clean away into all manner of moral abandonment , self-deceit , and hypocrisy ( cloaked , however , mostly under an aspect of the most respectable devotion ) ; or else he openly runs , like a mad dog , into atheism . whereas , let men be taught those chronometricals and horologicals , and while still retaining every common-sense incentive to whatever of virtue be practicable and desirable , and having these incentives strengthened , too , by the consciousness of powers to attain their mark ; then there would be an end to that fatal despair of becoming at all good , which has too often proved the vice-producing result in many minds of the undiluted chronometrical doctrines hitherto taught to mankind . but if any man say , that such a doctrine as this i lay down is false , is impious ; i would charitably refer that man to the history of christendom for the last 1800 years ; and ask him , whether , in spite of all the maxims of christ , that history is not just as full of blood , violence , wrong , and iniquity of every kind , as any previous portion of the world 's story ? therefore , it follows , that so far as practical results are concerned -- regarded in a purely earthly light -- the only great original moral doctrine of christianity ( _i . e._ the chronometrical gratuitous return of good for evil , as distinguished from the horological forgiveness of injuries taught by some of the pagan philosophers ) , has been found ( horologically ) a false one ; because after 1800 years ' inculcation from tens of thousands of pulpits , it has proved entirely impracticable .
melville	pierre	`` i but lay down , then , what the best mortal men do daily practice ; and what all really wicked men are very far removed from . i present consolation to the earnest man , who , among all his human frailties , is still agonizingly conscious of the beauty of chronometrical excellence . i hold up a practicable virtue to the vicious ; and interfere not with the eternal truth , that , sooner or later , in all cases , downright vice is downright woe .
melville	pierre	`` moreover : if -- -- '' but here the pamphlet was torn , and came to a most untidy termination . book xv . the cousins . i . though resolved to face all out to the last , at whatever desperate hazard , pierre had not started for the city without some reasonable plans , both with reference to his more immediate circumstances , and his ulterior condition .
melville	pierre	there resided in the city a cousin of his , glendinning stanly , better known in the general family as glen stanly , and by pierre , as cousin glen . like pierre , he was an only son ; his parents had died in his early childhood ; and within the present year he had returned from a protracted sojourn in europe , to enter , at the age of twenty-one , into the untrammeled possession of a noble property , which in the hands of faithful guardians , had largely accumulated .
melville	pierre	in their boyhood and earlier adolescence , pierre and glen had cherished a much more than cousinly attachment . at the age of ten , they had furnished an example of the truth , that the friendship of fine-hearted , generous boys , nurtured amid the romance-engendering comforts and elegancies of life , sometimes transcends the bounds of mere boyishness , and revels for a while in the empyrean of a love which only comes short , by one degree , of the sweetest sentiment entertained between the sexes . nor is this boy-love without the occasional fillips and spicinesses , which at times , by an apparent abatement , enhance the permanent delights of those more advanced lovers who love beneath the cestus of venus . jealousies are felt . the sight of another lad too much consorting with the boy 's beloved object , shall fill him with emotions akin to those of othello 's ; a fancied slight , or lessening of the every-day indications of warm feelings , shall prompt him to bitter upbraidings and reproaches ; or shall plunge him into evil moods , for which grim solitude only is congenial .
melville	pierre	nor are the letters of aphroditean devotees more charged with headlong vows and protestations , more cross-written and crammed with discursive sentimentalities , more undeviating in their semi-weekliness , or dayliness , as the case may be , than are the love-friendship missives of boys . among those bundles of papers which pierre , in an ill hour , so frantically destroyed in the chamber of the inn , were two large packages of letters , densely written , and in many cases inscribed crosswise throughout with red ink upon black ; so that the love in those letters was two layers deep , and one pen and one pigment were insufficient to paint it . the first package contained the letters of glen to pierre , the other those of pierre to glen , which , just prior to glen 's departure for europe , pierre had obtained from him , in order to re-read them in his absence , and so fortify himself the more in his affection , by reviving reference to the young , ardent hours of its earliest manifestations .
melville	pierre	but as the advancing fruit itself extrudes the beautiful blossom , so in many cases , does the eventual love for the other sex forever dismiss the preliminary love-friendship of boys . the mere outer friendship may in some degree -- greater or less -- survive ; but the singular love in it has perishingly dropped away .
melville	pierre	if in the eye of unyielding reality and truth , the earthly heart of man do indeed ever fix upon some one woman , to whom alone , thenceforth eternally to be a devotee , without a single shadow of the misgiving of its faith ; and who , to him , does perfectly embody his finest , loftiest dream of feminine loveliness , if this indeed be so -- and may heaven grant that it be -- nevertheless , in metropolitan cases , the love of the most single-eyed lover , almost invariably , is nothing more than the ultimate settling of innumerable wandering glances upon some one specific object ; as admonished , that the wonderful scope and variety of female loveliness , if too long suffered to sway us without decision , shall finally confound all power of selection . the confirmed bachelor is , in america , at least , quite as often the victim of a too profound appreciation of the infinite charmingness of woman , as made solitary for life by the legitimate empire of a cold and tasteless temperament .
melville	pierre	though the peculiar heart-longings pertaining to his age , had at last found their glowing response in the bosom of lucy ; yet for some period prior to that , pierre had not been insensible to the miscellaneous promptings of the passion . so that even before he became a declarative lover , love had yet made him her general votary ; and so already there had gradually come a cooling over that ardent sentiment which in earlier years he had cherished for glen .
melville	pierre	all round and round does the world lie as in a sharp-shooter 's ambush , to pick off the beautiful illusions of youth , by the pitiless cracking rifles of the realities of the age . if the general love for women , had in pierre sensibly modified his particular sentiment toward glen ; neither had the thousand nameless fascinations of the then brilliant paradises of france and italy , failed to exert their seductive influence on many of the previous feelings of glen . for as the very best advantages of life are not without some envious drawback , so it is among the evils of enlarged foreign travel , that in young and unsolid minds , it dislodges some of the finest feelings of the home-born nature ; replacing them with a fastidious superciliousness , which like the alledged bigoted federalism of old times would not -- according to a political legend -- grind its daily coffee in any mill save of european manufacture , and was satirically said to have thought of importing european air for domestic consumption . the mutually curtailed , lessening , long-postponed , and at last altogether ceasing letters of pierre and glen were the melancholy attestations of a fact , which perhaps neither of them took very severely to heart , as certainly , concerning it , neither took the other to task .
melville	pierre	in the earlier periods of that strange transition from the generous impulsiveness of youth to the provident circumspectness of age , there generally intervenes a brief pause of unpleasant reconsidering ; when finding itself all wide of its former spontaneous self , the soul hesitates to commit itself wholly to selfishness ; more than repents its wanderings ; -- yet all this is but transient ; and again hurried on by the swift current of life , the prompt-hearted boy scarce longer is to be recognized in matured man , -- very slow to feel , deliberate even in love , and statistical even in piety . during the sway of this peculiar period , the boy shall still make some strenuous efforts to retrieve his departing spontaneities ; but so alloyed are all such endeavors with the incipiencies of selfishness , that they were best not made at all ; since too often they seem but empty and self-deceptive sallies , or still worse , the merest hypocritical assumptions .
melville	pierre	upon the return of glen from abroad , the commonest courtesy , not to say the blood-relation between them , prompted pierre to welcome him home , with a letter , which though not over-long , and little enthusiastic , still breathed a spirit of cousinly consideration and kindness , pervadingly touched by the then naturally frank and all-attractive spirit of pierre . to this , the less earnest and now europeanized glen had replied in a letter all sudden suavity ; and in a strain of artistic artlessness , mourned the apparent decline of their friendship ; yet fondly trusted that now , notwithstanding their long separation , it would revive with added sincerity . yet upon accidentally fixing his glance upon the opening salutation of this delicate missive , pierre thought he perceived certain , not wholly disguisable chirographic tokens , that the `` my very dear pierre , '' with which the letter seemed to have been begun , had originally been written `` dear pierre ; '' but that when all was concluded , and glen 's signature put to it , then the ardent words `` my very '' had been prefixed to the reconsidered `` dear pierre ; '' a casual supposition , which possibly , however unfounded , materially retarded any answering warmth in pierre , lest his generous flame should only embrace a flaunted feather . nor was this idea altogether unreinforced , when on the reception of a second , and now half-business letter ( of which mixed sort nearly all the subsequent ones were ) , from glen , he found that the `` my very dear pierre '' had already retreated into `` my dear pierre ; '' and on a third occasion , into `` dear pierre ; '' and on a fourth , had made a forced and very spirited advanced march up to `` my dearest pierre . '' all of which fluctuations augured ill for the determinateness of that love , which , however immensely devoted to one cause , could yet hoist and sail under the flags of all nations . nor could he but now applaud a still subsequent letter from glen , which abruptly , and almost with apparent indecorousness , under the circumstances , commenced the strain of friendship without any overture of salutation whatever ; as if at last , owing to its infinite delicateness , entirely hopeless of precisely defining the nature of their mystical love , glen chose rather to leave that precise definition to the sympathetical heart and imagination of pierre ; while he himself would go on to celebrate the general relation , by many a sugared sentence of miscellaneous devotion . it was a little curious and rather sardonically diverting , to compare these masterly , yet not wholly successful , and indeterminate tactics of the accomplished glen , with the unfaltering stream of _beloved pierres_ , which not only flowed along the top margin of all his earlier letters , but here and there , from their subterranean channel , flashed out in bright intervals , through all the succeeding lines . nor had the chance recollection of these things at all restrained the reckless hand of pierre , when he threw the whole package of letters , both new and old , into that most honest and summary of all elements , which is neither a respecter of persons , nor a finical critic of what manner of writings it burns ; but like ultimate truth itself , of which it is the eloquent symbol , consumes all , and only consumes .
melville	pierre	when the betrothment of pierre to lucy had become an acknowledged thing , the courtly glen , besides the customary felicitations upon that event , had not omitted so fit an opportunity to re-tender to his cousin all his previous jars of honey and treacle , accompanied by additional boxes of candied citron and plums . pierre thanked him kindly ; but in certain little roguish ambiguities begged leave , on the ground of cloying , to return him inclosed by far the greater portion of his present ; whose non-substantialness was allegorically typified in the containing letter itself , prepaid with only the usual postage .
melville	pierre	true love , as every one knows , will still withstand many repulses , even though rude . but whether it was the love or the politeness of glen , which on this occasion proved invincible , is a matter we will not discuss . certain it was , that quite undaunted , glen nobly returned to the charge , and in a very prompt and unexpected answer , extended to pierre all the courtesies of the general city , and all the hospitalities of five sumptuous chambers , which he and his luxurious environments contrived nominally to occupy in the most fashionable private hotel of a very opulent town . nor did glen rest here ; but like napoleon , now seemed bent upon gaining the battle by throwing all his regiments upon one point of attack , and gaining that point at all hazards . hearing of some rumor at the tables of his relatives that the day was being fixed for the positive nuptials of pierre ; glen called all his parisian portfolios for his rosiest sheet , and with scented ink , and a pen of gold , indited a most burnished and redolent letter , which , after invoking all the blessings of apollo and venus , and the nine muses , and the cardinal virtues upon the coming event ; concluded at last with a really magnificent testimonial to his love .
melville	pierre	according to this letter , among his other real estate in the city , glen had inherited a very charming , little , old house , completely furnished in the style of the last century , in a quarter of the city which , though now not so garishly fashionable as of yore , still in its quiet secludedness , possessed great attractions for the retired billings and cooings of a honeymoon . indeed he begged leave now to christen it the cooery , and if after his wedding jaunt , pierre would deign to visit the city with his bride for a month or two 's sojourn , then the cooery would be but too happy in affording him a harbor . his sweet cousin need be under no apprehension . owing to the absence of any fit applicant for it , the house had now long been without a tenant , save an old , confidential , bachelor clerk of his father 's , who on a nominal rent , and more by way of safe-keeping to the house than any thing else , was now hanging up his well-furbished hat in its hall . this accommodating old clerk would quickly unpeg his beaver at the first hint of new occupants . glen would charge himself with supplying the house in advance with a proper retinue of servants ; fires would be made in the long-unoccupied chambers ; the venerable , grotesque , old mahoganies , and marbles , and mirror-frames , and moldings could be very soon dusted and burnished ; the kitchen was amply provided with the necessary utensils for cooking ; the strong box of old silver immemorially pertaining to the mansion , could be readily carted round from the vaults of the neighboring bank ; while the hampers of old china , still retained in the house , needed but little trouble to unpack ; so that silver and china would soon stand assorted in their appropriate closets ; at the turning of a faucet in the cellar , the best of the city 's water would not fail to contribute its ingredient to the concocting of a welcoming glass of negus before retiring on the first night of their arrival .
melville	pierre	the over-fastidiousness of some unhealthily critical minds , as well as the moral pusillanimity of others , equally bars the acceptance of effectually substantial favors from persons whose motive in proffering them , is not altogether clear and unimpeachable ; and toward whom , perhaps , some prior coolness or indifference has been shown . but when the acceptance of such a favor would be really convenient and desirable to the one party , and completely unattended with any serious distress to the other ; there would seem to be no sensible objection to an immediate embrace of the offer . and when the acceptor is in rank and fortune the general equal of the profferer , and perhaps his superior , so that any courtesy he receives , can be amply returned in the natural course of future events , then all motives to decline are very materially lessened . and as for the thousand inconceivable finicalnesses of small pros and cons about imaginary fitnesses , and proprieties , and self-consistencies ; thank heaven , in the hour of heart-health , none such shilly-shallying sail-trimmers ever balk the onward course of a bluff-minded man . he takes the world as it is ; and carelessly accommodates himself to its whimsical humors ; nor ever feels any compunction at receiving the greatest possible favors from those who are as able to grant , as free to bestow . he himself bestows upon occasion ; so that , at bottom , common charity steps in to dictate a favorable consideration for all possible profferings ; seeing that the acceptance shall only the more enrich him , indirectly , for new and larger beneficences of his own .
melville	pierre	and as for those who noways pretend with themselves to regulate their deportment by considerations of genuine benevolence , and to whom such courteous profferings hypocritically come from persons whom they suspect for secret enemies ; then to such minds not only will their own worldly tactics at once forbid the uncivil blank repulse of such offers ; but if they are secretly malicious as well as frigid , or if they are at all capable of being fully gratified by the sense of concealed superiority and mastership ( which precious few men are ) then how delightful for such persons under the guise of mere acquiescence in his own voluntary civilities , to make genteel use of their foe . for one would like to know , what were foes made for except to be used ? in the rude ages men hunted and javelined the tiger , because they hated him for a mischief-minded wild-beast ; but in these enlightened times , though we love the tiger as little as ever , still we mostly hunt him for the sake of his skin . a wise man then will wear his tiger ; every morning put on his tiger for a robe to keep him warm and adorn him . in this view , foes are far more desirable than friends ; for who would hunt and kill his own faithful affectionate dog for the sake of his skin ? and is a dog 's skin as valuable as a tiger 's ? cases there are where it becomes soberly advisable , by direct arts to convert some well-wishers into foes . it is false that in point of policy a man should never make enemies . as well-wishers some men may not only be nugatory but positive obstacles in your peculiar plans ; but as foes you may subordinately cement them into your general design .
melville	pierre	but into these ulterior refinements of cool tuscan policy , pierre as yet had never become initiated ; his experiences hitherto not having been varied and ripe enough for that ; besides , he had altogether too much generous blood in his heart . nevertheless , thereafter , in a less immature hour , though still he shall not have the heart to practice upon such maxims as the above , yet shall he have the brain thoroughly to comprehend their practicability ; which is not always the case . and generally , in worldly wisdom , men will deny to one the possession of all insight , which one does not by his every-day outward life practically reveal . it is a very common error of some unscrupulously infidel-minded , selfish , unprincipled , or downright knavish men , to suppose that believing men , or benevolent-hearted men , or good men , do not know enough to be unscrupulously selfish , do not know enough to be unscrupulous knaves . and thus -- thanks to the world ! -- are there many spies in the world 's camp , who are mistaken for strolling simpletons . and these strolling simpletons seem to act upon the principle , that in certain things , we do not so much learn , by showing that already we know a vast deal , as by negatively seeming rather ignorant . but here we press upon the frontiers of that sort of wisdom , which it is very well to possess , but not sagacious to show that you possess . still , men there are , who having quite done with the world , all its mere worldly contents are become so far indifferent , that they care little of what mere worldly imprudence they may be guilty .
melville	pierre	now , if it were not conscious considerations like the really benevolent or neutral ones first mentioned above , it was certainly something akin to them , which had induced pierre to return a straightforward , manly , and entire acceptance to his cousin of the offer of the house ; thanking him , over and over , for his most supererogatory kindness concerning the pre-engagement of servants and so forth , and the setting in order of the silver and china ; but reminding him , nevertheless , that he had overlooked all special mention of wines , and begged him to store the bins with a few of the very best brands . he would likewise be obliged , if he would personally purchase at a certain celebrated grocer 's , a small bag of undoubted mocha coffee ; but glen need not order it to be roasted or ground , because pierre preferred that both those highly important and flavor-deciding operations should be performed instantaneously previous to the final boiling and serving . nor did he say that he would pay for the wines and the mocha ; he contented himself with merely stating the remissness on the part of his cousin , and pointing out the best way of remedying it .
melville	pierre	he concluded his letter by intimating that though the rumor of a set day , and a near one , for his nuptials , was unhappily but ill-founded , yet he would not hold glen 's generous offer as merely based upon that presumption , and consequently falling with it ; but on the contrary , would consider it entirely good for whatever time it might prove available to pierre . he was betrothed beyond a peradventure ; and hoped to be married ere death . meanwhile , glen would further oblige him by giving the confidential clerk a standing notice to quit .
melville	pierre	though at first quite amazed at this letter , -- for indeed , his offer might possibly have proceeded as much from ostentation as any thing else , nor had he dreamed of so unhesitating an acceptance , -- pierre 's cousin was too much of a precocious young man of the world , disclosedly to take it in any other than a very friendly , and cousinly , and humorous , and yet practical way ; which he plainly evinced by a reply far more sincere and every way creditable , apparently , both to his heart and head , than any letter he had written to pierre since the days of their boyhood . and thus , by the bluffness and , in some sort , uncompunctuousness of pierre , this very artificial youth was well betrayed into an act of effective kindness ; being forced now to drop the empty mask of ostentation , and put on the solid hearty features of a genuine face . and just so , are some people in the world to be joked into occasional effective goodness , when all coyness , and coolness , all resentments , and all solemn preaching , would fail .
melville	pierre	ii . but little would we comprehend the peculiar relation between pierre and glen -- a relation involving in the end the most serious results -- were there not here thrown over the whole equivocal , preceding account of it , another and more comprehensive equivocalness , which shall absorb all minor ones in itself ; and so make one pervading ambiguity the only possible explanation for all the ambiguous details .
melville	pierre	it had long been imagined by pierre , that prior to his own special devotion to lucy , the splendid glen had not been entirely insensible to her surprising charms . yet this conceit in its incipiency , he knew not how to account for . assuredly his cousin had never in the slightest conceivable hint betrayed it ; and as for lucy , the same intuitive delicacy which forever forbade pierre to question her on the subject , did equally close her own voluntary lips . between pierre and lucy , delicateness put her sacred signet on this chest of secrecy ; which like the wax of an executor upon a desk , though capable of being melted into nothing by the smallest candle , for all this , still possesses to the reverent the prohibitive virtue of inexorable bars and bolts .
melville	pierre	if pierre superficially considered the deportment of glen toward him , therein he could find no possible warrant for indulging the suspicious idea . doth jealousy smile so benignantly and offer its house to the bride ? still , on the other hand , to quit the mere surface of the deportment of glen , and penetrate beneath its brocaded vesture ; there pierre sometimes seemed to see the long-lurking and yet unhealed wound of all a rejected lover 's most rankling detestation of a supplanting rival , only intensified by their former friendship , and the unimpairable blood-relation between them . now , viewed by the light of this master-solution , all the singular enigmas in glen ; his capriciousness in the matter of the epistolary -- '' dear pierres '' and `` dearest pierres ; '' the mercurial fall from the fever-heat of cordiality , to below the zero of indifference ; then the contrary rise to fever-heat ; and , above all , his emphatic redundancy of devotion so soon as the positive espousals of pierre seemed on the point of consummation ; thus read , all these riddles apparently found their cunning solution . for the deeper that some men feel a secret and poignant feeling , the higher they pile the belying surfaces . the friendly deportment of glen then was to be considered as in direct proportion to his hoarded hate ; and the climax of that hate was evinced in throwing open his house to the bride . yet if hate was the abstract cause , hate could not be the immediate motive of the conduct of glen . is hate so hospitable ? the immediate motive of glen then must be the intense desire to disguise from the wide world , a fact unspeakably humiliating to his gold-laced and haughty soul : the fact that in the profoundest desire of his heart , pierre had so victoriously supplanted him . yet was it that very artful deportment in glen , which glen profoundly assumed to this grand end ; that consummately artful deportment it was , which first obtruded upon pierre the surmise , which by that identical method his cousin was so absorbedly intent upon rendering impossible to him . hence we here see that as in the negative way the secrecy of any strong emotion is exceedingly difficult to be kept lastingly private to one 's own bosom by any human being ; so it is one of the most fruitless undertakings in the world , to attempt by affirmative assumptions to tender to men , the precisely opposite emotion as yours . therefore the final wisdom decrees , that if you have aught which you desire to keep a secret to yourself , be a quietist there , and do and say nothing at all about it . for among all the poor chances , this is the least poor . pretensions and substitutions are only the recourse of under-graduates in the science of the world ; in which science , on his own ground , my lord chesterfield , is the poorest possible preceptor . the earliest instinct of the child , and the ripest experience of age , unite in affirming simplicity to be the truest and profoundest part for man . likewise this simplicity is so universal and all-containing as a rule for human life , that the subtlest bad man , and the purest good man , as well as the profoundest wise man , do all alike present it on that side which they socially turn to the inquisitive and unscrupulous world .
melville	pierre	iii . now the matter of the house had remained in precisely the above-stated awaiting predicament , down to the time of pierre 's great life-revolution , the receipt of isabel 's letter . and though , indeed , pierre could not but naturally hesitate at still accepting the use of the dwelling , under the widely different circumstances in which he now found himself ; and though at first the strongest possible spontaneous objections on the ground of personal independence , pride , and general scorn , all clamorously declared in his breast against such a course ; yet , finally , the same uncompunctuous , ever-adaptive sort of motive which had induced his original acceptation , prompted him , in the end , still to maintain it unrevoked . it would at once set him at rest from all immediate tribulations of mere bed and board ; and by affording him a shelter , for an indefinite term , enable him the better to look about him , and consider what could best be done to further the permanent comfort of those whom fate had intrusted to his charge .
melville	pierre	irrespective , it would seem , of that wide general awaking of his profounder being , consequent upon the extraordinary trials he had so aggregatively encountered of late ; the thought was indignantly suggested to him , that the world must indeed be organically despicable , if it held that an offer , superfluously accepted in the hour of his abundance , should now , be rejected in that of his utmost need . and without at all imputing any singularity of benevolent-mindedness to his cousin , he did not for a moment question , that under the changed aspect of affairs , glen would at least pretend the more eagerly to welcome him to the house , now that the mere thing of apparent courtesy had become transformed into something like a thing of positive and urgent necessity . when pierre also considered that not himself only was concerned , but likewise two peculiarly helpless fellow-beings , one of them bound to him from the first by the most sacred ties , and lately inspiring an emotion which passed all human precedent in its mixed and mystical import ; these added considerations completely overthrew in pierre all remaining dictates of his vague pride and false independence , if such indeed had ever been his .
melville	pierre	though the interval elapsing between his decision to depart with his companions for the city , and his actual start in the coach , had not enabled him to receive any replying word from his cousin ; and though pierre knew better than to expect it ; yet a preparative letter to him he had sent ; and did not doubt that this proceeding would prove well-advised in the end .
melville	pierre	in naturally strong-minded men , however young and inexperienced in some things , those great and sudden emergencies , which but confound the timid and the weak , only serve to call forth all their generous latentness , and teach them , as by inspiration , extraordinary maxims of conduct , whose counterpart , in other men , is only the result of a long , variously-tried and pains-taking life . one of those maxims is , that when , through whatever cause , we are suddenly translated from opulence to need , or from a fair fame to a foul ; and straightway it becomes necessary not to contradict the thing -- so far at least as the mere imputation goes , -- to some one previously entertaining high conventional regard for us , and from whom we would now solicit some genuine helping offices ; then , all explanation or palation should be scorned ; promptness , boldness , utter gladiatorianism , and a defiant non-humility should mark every syllable we breathe , and every line we trace .
melville	pierre	the preparative letter of pierre to glen , plunged at once into the very heart of the matter , and was perhaps the briefest letter he had ever written him . though by no means are such characteristics invariable exponents of the predominant mood or general disposition of a man ( since so accidental a thing as a numb finger , or a bad quill , or poor ink , or squalid paper , or a rickety desk may produce all sorts of modifications ) , yet in the present instance , the handwriting of pierre happened plainly to attest and corroborate the spirit of his communication . the sheet was large ; but the words were placarded upon it in heavy though rapid lines , only six or eight to the page . and as the footman of a haughty visitor -- some count or duke -- announces the chariot of his lord by a thunderous knock on the portal ; so to glen did pierre , in the broad , sweeping , and prodigious superscription of his letter , forewarn him what manner of man was on the road .
melville	pierre	in the moment of strong feeling a wonderful condensativeness points the tongue and pen ; so that ideas , then enunciated sharp and quick as minute-guns , in some other hour of unruffledness or unstimulatedness , require considerable time and trouble to verbally recall .
melville	pierre	not here and now can we set down the precise contents of pierre 's letter , without a tautology illy doing justice to the ideas themselves . and though indeed the dread of tautology be the continual torment of some earnest minds , and , as such , is surely a weakness in them ; and though no wise man will wonder at conscientious virgil all eager at death to burn his æniad for a monstrous heap of inefficient superfluity ; yet not to dread tautology at times only belongs to those enviable dunces , whom the partial god hath blessed , over all the earth , with the inexhaustible self-riches of vanity , and folly , and a blind self-complacency .
melville	pierre	some rumor of the discontinuance of his betrothment to lucy tartan ; of his already consummated marriage with a poor and friendless orphan ; of his mother 's disowning him consequent upon these events ; such rumors , pierre now wrote to his cousin , would very probably , in the parlors of his city-relatives and acquaintances , precede his arrival in town . but he hinted no word of any possible commentary on these things . he simply went on to say , that now , through the fortune of life -- which was but the proverbially unreliable fortune of war -- he was , for the present , thrown entirely upon his own resources , both for his own support and that of his wife , as well as for the temporary maintenance of a girl , whom he had lately had excellent reason for taking under his especial protection . he proposed a permanent residence in the city ; not without some nearly quite settled plans as to the procuring of a competent income , without any ulterior reference to any member of their wealthy and widely ramified family . the house , whose temporary occupancy glen had before so handsomely proffered him , would now be doubly and trebly desirable to him . but the pre-engaged servants , and the old china , and the old silver , and the old wines , and the mocha , were now become altogether unnecessary . pierre would merely take the place -- for a short interval -- of the worthy old clerk ; and , so far as glen was concerned , simply stand guardian of the dwelling , till his plans were matured . his cousin had originally made his most bounteous overture , to welcome the coming of the presumed bride of pierre ; and though another lady had now taken her place at the altar , yet pierre would still regard the offer of glen as impersonal in that respect , and bearing equal reference to any young lady , who should prove her claim to the possessed hand of pierre .
melville	pierre	since there was no universal law of opinion in such matters , glen , on general worldly grounds , might not consider the real mrs. glendinning altogether so suitable a match for pierre , as he possibly might have held numerous other young ladies in his eye : nevertheless , glen would find her ready to return with sincerity all his cousinly regard and attention . in conclusion , pierre said , that he and his party meditated an immediate departure , and would very probably arrive in town in eight-and-forty hours after the mailing of the present letter . he therefore begged glen to see the more indispensable domestic appliances of the house set in some little order against their arrival ; to have the rooms aired and lighted ; and also forewarn the confidential clerk of what he might soon expect . then , without any tapering sequel of -- '' _yours , very truly and faithfully , my dear cousin glen_ , '' he finished the letter with the abrupt and isolated signature of -- '' pierre . ''
melville	pierre	book xvi . first night of their arrival in the city . i . the stage was belated . the country road they traveled entered the city by a remarkably wide and winding street , a great thoroughfare for its less opulent inhabitants . there was no moon and few stars . it was that preluding hour of the night when the shops are just closing , and the aspect of almost every wayfarer , as he passes through the unequal light reflected from the windows , speaks of one hurrying not abroad , but homeward . though the thoroughfare was winding , yet no sweep that it made greatly obstructed its long and imposing vista ; so that when the coach gained the top of the long and very gradual slope running toward the obscure heart of the town , and the twinkling perspective of two long and parallel rows of lamps was revealed -- lamps which seemed not so much intended to dispel the general gloom , as to show some dim path leading through it , into some gloom still deeper beyond -- when the coach gained this critical point , the whole vast triangular town , for a moment , seemed dimly and despondently to capitulate to the eye .
melville	pierre	and now , ere descending the gradually-sloping declivity , and just on its summit as it were , the inmates of the coach , by numerous hard , painful joltings , and ponderous , dragging trundlings , are suddenly made sensible of some great change in the character of the road . the coach seems rolling over cannon-balls of all calibers . grasping pierre 's arm , isabel eagerly and forebodingly demands what is the cause of this most strange and unpleasant transition .
melville	pierre	`` the pavements , isabel ; this is the town . '' isabel was silent . but , the first time for many weeks , delly voluntarily spoke : `` it feels not so soft as the green sward , master pierre . ''
melville	pierre	`` no , miss ulver , '' said pierre , very bitterly , `` the buried hearts of some dead citizens have perhaps come to the surface . '' `` sir ? '' said delly . `` and are they so hard-hearted here ? '' asked isabel .
melville	pierre	`` ask yonder pavements , isabel . milk dropt from the milkman 's can in december , freezes not more quickly on those stones , than does snow-white innocence , if in poverty , it chance to fall in these streets . ''
melville	pierre	`` then god help my hard fate , master pierre , '' sobbed delly . `` why didst thou drag hither a poor outcast like me ? '' `` forgive me , miss ulver , '' exclaimed pierre , with sudden warmth , and yet most marked respect ; `` forgive me ; never yet have i entered the city by night , but , somehow , it made me feel both bitter and sad . come , be cheerful , we shall soon be comfortably housed , and have our comfort all to ourselves ; the old clerk i spoke to you about , is now doubtless ruefully eying his hat on the peg . come , cheer up , isabel ; -- 't is a long ride , but here we are , at last . come ! 't is not very far now to our welcome . ''
melville	pierre	`` i hear a strange shuffling and clattering , '' said delly , with a shudder . `` it does not seem so light as just now , '' said isabel . `` yes , '' returned pierre , `` it is the shop-shutters being put on ; it is the locking , and bolting , and barring of windows and doors ; the town's-people are going to their rest . ''
melville	pierre	`` please god they may find it ! '' sighed delly . `` they lock and bar out , then , when they rest , do they , pierre ? '' said isabel . `` yes , and you were thinking that does not bode well for the welcome i spoke of . ''
melville	pierre	`` thou read'st all my soul ; yes , i was thinking of that . but whither lead these long , narrow , dismal side-glooms we pass every now and then ? what are they ? they seem terribly still . i see scarce any body in them ; -- there 's another , now . see how haggardly look its criss-cross , far-separate lamps. -- what are these side-glooms , dear pierre ; whither lead they ? ''
melville	pierre	`` they are the thin tributaries , sweet isabel , to the great oronoco thoroughfare we are in ; and like true tributaries , they come from the far-hidden places ; from under dark beetling secrecies of mortar and stone ; through the long marsh-grasses of villainy , and by many a transplanted bough-beam , where the wretched have hung . ''
melville	pierre	`` i know nothing of these things , pierre . but i like not the town . think'st thou , pierre , the time will ever come when all the earth shall be paved ? '' `` thank god , that never can be ! ''
melville	pierre	`` these silent side-glooms are horrible ; -- look ! methinks , not for the world would i turn into one . '' that moment the nigh fore-wheel sharply grated under the body of the coach . `` courage ! '' cried pierre , `` we are in it ! -- not so very solitary either ; here comes a traveler . ''
melville	pierre	`` hark , what is that ? '' said delly , `` that keen iron-ringing sound ? it passed us just now . '' `` the keen traveler , '' said pierre , `` he has steel plates to his boot-heels ; -- some tender-souled elder son , i suppose . ''
melville	pierre	`` pierre , '' said isabel , `` this silence is unnatural , is fearful . the forests are never so still . '' `` because brick and mortar have deeper secrets than wood or fell , sweet isabel . but here we turn again ; now if i guess right , two more turns will bring us to the door . courage , all will be well ; doubtless he has prepared a famous supper . courage , isabel . come , shall it be tea or coffee ? some bread , or crisp toast ? we 'll have eggs , too ; and some cold chicken , perhaps . '' -- then muttering to himself -- '' i hope not that , either ; no cold collations ! there 's too much of that in these paving-stones here , set out for the famishing beggars to eat . no . i wo n't have the cold chicken . '' then aloud -- '' but here we turn again ; yes , just as i thought . ho , driver ! '' ( thrusting his head out of the window ) `` to the right ! to the right ! it should be on the right ! the first house with a light on the right ! ''
melville	pierre	`` no lights yet but the street 's , '' answered the surly voice of the driver . `` stupid ! he has passed it -- yes , yes -- he has ! ho ! ho ! stop ; turn back . have you not passed lighted windows ? ''
melville	pierre	`` no lights but the street 's , '' was the rough reply . `` what 's the number ? the number ? do n't keep me beating about here all night ! the number , i say ! '' `` i do not know it , '' returned pierre ; `` but i well know the house ; you must have passed it , i repeat . you must turn back . surely you have passed lighted windows ? ''
melville	pierre	`` then them lights must burn black ; there 's no lighted windows in the street ; i knows the city ; old maids lives here , and they are all to bed ; rest is warehouses . ''
melville	pierre	`` will you stop the coach , or not ? '' cried pierre , now incensed at his surliness in continuing to drive on . `` i obeys orders : the first house with a light ; and 'cording to my reck'ning -- though to be sure , i do n't know nothing of the city where i was born and bred all my life -- no , i knows nothing at all about it -- 'cording to my reck'ning , the first light in this here street will be the watch-house of the ward -- yes , there it is -- all right ! cheap lodgings ye 've engaged -- nothing to pay , and wictuals in . ''
melville	pierre	to certain temperaments , especially when previously agitated by any deep feeling , there is perhaps nothing more exasperating , and which sooner explodes all self-command , than the coarse , jeering insolence of a porter , cabman , or hack-driver . fetchers and carriers of the worst city infamy as many of them are ; professionally familiar with the most abandoned haunts ; in the heart of misery , they drive one of the most mercenary of all the trades of guilt . day-dozers and sluggards on their lazy boxes in the sunlight , and felinely wakeful and cat-eyed in the dark ; most habituated to midnight streets , only trod by sneaking burglars , wantons , and debauchees ; often in actual pandering league with the most abhorrent sinks ; so that they are equally solicitous and suspectful that every customer they encounter in the dark , will prove a profligate or a knave ; this hideous tribe of ogres , and charon ferry-men to corruption and death , naturally slide into the most practically calvinistical view of humanity , and hold every man at bottom a fit subject for the coarsest ribaldry and jest ; only fine coats and full pockets can whip such mangy hounds into decency . the least impatience , any quickness of temper , a sharp remonstrating word from a customer in a seedy coat , or betraying any other evidence of poverty , however minute and indirect ( for in that pecuniary respect they are the most piercing and infallible of all the judgers of men ) , will be almost sure to provoke , in such cases , their least endurable disdain .
melville	pierre	perhaps it was the unconscious transfer to the stage-driver of some such ideas as these , which now prompted the highly irritated pierre to an act , which , in a more benignant hour , his better reason would have restrained him from .
melville	pierre	he did not see the light to which the driver had referred ; and was heedless , in his sudden wrath , that the coach was now going slower in approaching it . ere isabel could prevent him , he burst open the door , and leaping to the pavement , sprang ahead of the horses , and violently reined back the leaders by their heads . the driver seized his four-in-hand whip , and with a volley of oaths was about striking out its long , coiling lash at pierre , when his arm was arrested by a policeman , who suddenly leaping on the stayed coach , commanded him to keep the peace .
melville	pierre	`` speak ! what is the difficulty here ? be quiet , ladies , nothing serious has happened . speak you ! '' `` pierre ! pierre ! '' cried the alarmed isabel . in an instant pierre was at her side by the window ; and now turning to the officer , explained to him that the driver had persisted in passing the house at which he was ordered to stop .
melville	pierre	`` then he shall turn to the right about with you , sir ; -- in double quick time too ; do ye hear ? i know you rascals well enough . turn about , you sir , and take the gentleman where he directed . ''
melville	pierre	the cowed driver was beginning a long string of criminating explanations , when turning to pierre , the policeman calmly desired him to re-enter the coach ; he would see him safely at his destination ; and then seating himself beside the driver on the box , commanded him to tell the number given him by the gentleman .
melville	pierre	`` he do n't know no numbers -- did n't i say he did n't -- that 's what i got mad about . '' `` be still '' -- said the officer . `` sir '' -- turning round and addressing pierre within ; `` where do you wish to go ? ''
melville	pierre	`` i do not know the number , but it is a house in this street ; we have passed it ; it is , i think , the fourth or fifth house this side of the last corner we turned . it must be lighted up too . it is the small old-fashioned dwelling with stone lion-heads above the windows . but make him turn round , and drive slowly , and i will soon point it out . ''
melville	pierre	`` ca n't see lions in the dark '' -- growled the driver -- '' lions ; ha ! ha ! jackasses more likely ! '' `` look you , '' said the officer , `` i shall see you tightly housed this night , my fine fellow , if you do n't cease your jabber . sir , '' he added , resuming with pierre , `` i am sure there is some mistake here . i perfectly well know now the house you mean . i passed it within the last half-hour ; all as quiet there as ever . no one lives there , i think ; i never saw a light in it . are you not mistaken in something , then ? ''
melville	pierre	pierre paused in perplexity and foreboding . was it possible that glen had willfully and utterly neglected his letter ? not possible . but it might not have come to his hand ; the mails sometimes delayed . then again , it was not wholly out of the question , that the house was prepared for them after all , even though it showed no outward sign . but that was not probable . at any rate , as the driver protested , that his four horses and lumbering vehicle could not turn short round in that street ; and that if he must go back , it could only be done by driving on , and going round the block , and so retracing his road ; and as after such a procedure , on his part , then in case of a confirmed disappointment respecting the house , the driver would seem warranted , at least in some of his unmannerliness ; and as pierre loathed the villain altogether , therefore , in order to run no such risks , he came to a sudden determination on the spot .
melville	pierre	`` i owe you very much , my good friend , '' said he to the officer , `` for your timely assistance . to be frank , what you have just told me has indeed perplexed me not a little concerning the place where i proposed to stop . is there no hotel in this neighborhood , where i could leave these ladies while i seek my friend ? ''
melville	pierre	wonted to all manner of deceitfulness , and engaged in a calling which unavoidably makes one distrustful of mere appearances , however specious , however honest ; the really good-hearted officer , now eyed pierre in the dubious light with a most unpleasant scrutiny ; and he abandoned the `` sir , '' and the tone of his voice sensibly changed , as he replied : -- '' there is no hotel in this neighborhood ; it is too off the thoroughfares . ''
melville	pierre	`` come ! come ! '' -- cried the driver , now growing bold again -- '' though you 're an officer , i 'm a citizen for all that . you have n't any further right to keep me out of my bed now . he do n't know where he wants to go to , cause he haint got no place at all to go to ; so i 'll just dump him here , and you dar'n't stay me . ''
melville	pierre	`` do n't be impertinent now , '' said the officer , but not so sternly as before . `` i 'll have my rights though , i tell you that ! leave go of my arm ; damn ye , get off the box ; i 've the law now . i say mister , come tramp , here goes your luggage , '' and so saying he dragged toward him a light trunk on the top of the stage .
melville	pierre	`` keep a clean tongue in ye now '' -- said the officer -- '' and do n't be in quite so great a hurry , '' then addressing pierre , who had now re-alighted from the coach -- '' well , this ca n't continue ; what do you intend to do ? ''
melville	pierre	`` not to ride further with that man , at any rate , '' said pierre ; `` i will stop right here for the present . '' `` he ! he ! '' laughed the driver ; `` he ! he ! 'mazing 'commodating now -- we hitches now , we do -- stops right afore the watch-house -- he ! he ! -- that 's funny ! ''
melville	pierre	`` off with the luggage then , driver , '' said the policeman -- '' here hand the small trunk , and now away and unlash there behind . '' during all this scene , delly had remained perfectly silent in her trembling and rustic alarm ; while isabel , by occasional cries to pierre , had vainly besought some explanation . but though their complete ignorance of city life had caused pierre 's two companions to regard the scene thus far with too much trepidation ; yet now , when in the obscurity of night , and in the heart of a strange town , pierre handed them out of the coach into the naked street , and they saw their luggage piled so near the white light of a watch-house , the same ignorance , in some sort , reversed its effects on them ; for they little fancied in what really untoward and wretched circumstances they first touched the flagging of the city .
melville	pierre	as the coach lumbered off , and went rolling into the wide murkiness beyond , pierre spoke to the officer . `` it is a rather strange accident , i confess , my friend , but strange accidents will sometimes happen . ''
melville	pierre	`` in the best of families , '' rejoined the other , a little ironically . now , i must not quarrel with this man , thought pierre to himself , stung at the officer 's tone . then said : -- '' is there any one in your -- office ? ''
melville	pierre	`` no one as yet -- not late enough . '' `` will you have the kindness then to house these ladies there for the present , while i make haste to provide them with better lodgment ? lead on , if you please . ''
melville	pierre	the man seemed to hesitate a moment , but finally acquiesced ; and soon they passed under the white light , and entered a large , plain , and most forbidding-looking room , with hacked wooden benches and bunks ranged along the sides , and a railing before a desk in one corner . the permanent keeper of the place was quietly reading a paper by the long central double bat's-wing gas-light ; and three officers off duty were nodding on a bench .
melville	pierre	`` not very liberal accommodations '' -- said the officer , quietly ; `` nor always the best of company , but we try to be civil . be seated , ladies , '' politely drawing a small bench toward them . `` hallo , my friends , '' said pierre , approaching the nodding three beyond , and tapping them on the shoulder -- '' hallo , i say ! will you do me a little favor ? will you help bring some trunks in from the street ? i will satisfy you for your trouble , and be much obliged into the bargain . ''
melville	pierre	instantly the three noddies , used to sudden awakenings , opened their eyes , and stared hard ; and being further enlightened by the bat's-wings and first officer , promptly brought in the luggage as desired .
melville	pierre	pierre hurriedly sat down by isabel , and in a few words gave her to understand , that she was now in a perfectly secure place , however unwelcoming ; that the officers would take every care of her , while he made all possible speed in running to the house , and indubitably ascertaining how matters stood there . he hoped to be back in less than ten minutes with good tidings . explaining his intention to the first officer , and begging him not to leave the girls till he should return , he forthwith sallied into the street . he quickly came to the house , and immediately identified it . but all was profoundly silent and dark . he rang the bell , but no answer ; and waiting long enough to be certain , that either the house was indeed deserted , or else the old clerk was unawakeable or absent ; and at all events , certain that no slightest preparation had been made for their arrival ; pierre , bitterly disappointed , returned to isabel with this most unpleasant information .
melville	pierre	nevertheless something must be done , and quickly . turning to one of the officers , he begged him to go and seek a hack , that the whole party might be taken to some respectable lodging . but the man , as well as his comrades , declined the errand on the score , that there was no stand on their beat , and they could not , on any account , leave their beat . so pierre himself must go . he by no means liked to leave isabel and delly again , on an expedition which might occupy some time . but there seemed no resource , and time now imperiously pressed . communicating his intention therefore to isabel , and again entreating the officer 's particular services as before , and promising not to leave him unrequited ; pierre again sallied out . he looked up and down the street , and listened ; but no sound of any approaching vehicle was audible . he ran on , and turning the first corner , bent his rapid steps toward the greatest and most central avenue of the city , assured that there , if anywhere , he would find what he wanted . it was some distance off ; and he was not without hope that an empty hack would meet him ere he arrived there . but the few stray ones he encountered had all muffled fares . he continued on , and at last gained the great avenue . not habitually used to such scenes , pierre for a moment was surprised , that the instant he turned out of the narrow , and dark , and death-like bye-street , he should find himself suddenly precipitated into the not-yet-repressed noise and contention , and all the garish night-life of a vast thoroughfare , crowded and wedged by day , and even now , at this late hour , brilliant with occasional illuminations , and echoing to very many swift wheels and footfalls .
melville	pierre	ii . `` i say , my pretty one ! dear ! dear ! young man ! oh , love , you are in a vast hurry , aint you ? ca n't you stop a bit , now , my dear : do -- there 's a sweet fellow . ''
melville	pierre	pierre turned ; and in the flashing , sinister , evil cross-lights of a druggist 's window , his eye caught the person of a wonderfully beautifully-featured girl ; scarlet-cheeked , glaringly-arrayed , and of a figure all natural grace but unnatural vivacity . her whole form , however , was horribly lit by the green and yellow rays from the druggist 's .
melville	pierre	`` my god ! '' shuddered pierre , hurrying forward , `` the town 's first welcome to youth ! '' he was just crossing over to where a line of hacks were drawn up against the opposite curb , when his eye was arrested by a short , gilded name , rather reservedly and aristocratically denominating a large and very handsome house , the second story of which was profusely lighted . he looked up , and was very certain that in this house were the apartments of glen . yielding to a sudden impulse , he mounted the single step toward the door , and rang the bell , which was quickly responded to by a very civil black .
melville	pierre	as the door opened , he heard the distant interior sound of dancing-music and merriment . `` is mr. stanly in ? '' `` mr. stanly ? yes , but he 's engaged . '' `` how ? '' `` he is somewhere in the drawing rooms . my mistress is giving a party to the lodgers . ''
melville	pierre	`` ay ? tell mr. stanly i wish to see him for one moment if you please ; only one moment . '' `` i dare not call him , sir . he said that possibly some one might call for him to-night -- they are calling every night for mr. stanly -- but i must admit no one , on the plea of the party . ''
melville	pierre	a dark and bitter suspicion now darted through the mind of pierre ; and ungovernably yielding to it , and resolved to prove or falsify it without delay , he said to the black :
melville	pierre	`` my business is pressing . i must see mr . stanly . '' `` i am sorry , sir , but orders are orders : i am his particular servant here -- the one that sees his silver every holyday . i ca n't disobey him . may i shut the door , sir ? for as it is , i can not admit you . ''
melville	pierre	`` the drawing-rooms are on the second floor , are they not ? '' said pierre quietly . `` yes , '' said the black pausing in surprise , and holding the door . `` yonder are the stairs , i think ? ''
melville	pierre	`` that way , sir ; but this is yours ; '' and the now suspicious black was just on the point of closing the portal violently upon him , when pierre thrust him suddenly aside , and springing up the long stairs , found himself facing an open door , from whence proceeded a burst of combined brilliancy and melody , doubly confusing to one just emerged from the street . but bewildered and all demented as he momentarily felt , he instantly stalked in , and confounded the amazed company with his unremoved slouched hat , pale cheek , and whole dusty , travel-stained , and ferocious aspect .
melville	pierre	`` mr. stanly ! where is mr . stanly ? '' he cried , advancing straight through a startled quadrille , while all the music suddenly hushed , and every eye was fixed in vague affright upon him .
melville	pierre	`` mr. stanly ! mr . stanly ! '' cried several bladish voices , toward the further end of the further drawing-room , into which the first one widely opened , `` here is a most peculiar fellow after you ; who the devil is he ? ''
melville	pierre	`` i think i see him , '' replied a singularly cool , deliberate , and rather drawling voice , yet a very silvery one , and at bottom perhaps a very resolute one ; `` i think i see him ; stand aside , my good fellow , will you ; ladies , remove , remove from between me and yonder hat . ''
melville	pierre	the polite compliance of the company thus addressed , now revealed to the advancing pierre , the tall , robust figure of a remarkably splendid-looking , and brown-bearded young man , dressed with surprising plainness , almost demureness , for such an occasion ; but this plainness of his dress was not so obvious at first , the material was so fine , and admirably fitted . he was carelessly lounging in a half side-long attitude upon a large sofa , and appeared as if but just interrupted in some very agreeable chat with a diminutive but vivacious brunette , occupying the other end . the dandy and the man ; strength and effeminacy ; courage and indolence , were so strangely blended in this superb-eyed youth , that at first sight , it seemed impossible to decide whether there was any genuine mettle in him , or not .
melville	pierre	some years had gone by since the cousins had met ; years peculiarly productive of the greatest conceivable changes in the general personal aspect of human beings . nevertheless , the eye seldom alters . the instant their eyes met , they mutually recognized each other . but both did not betray the recognition .
melville	pierre	`` glen ! '' cried pierre , and paused a few steps from him . but the superb-eyed only settled himself lower down in his lounging attitude , and slowly withdrawing a small , unpretending , and unribboned glass from his vest pocket , steadily , yet not entirely insultingly , notwithstanding the circumstances , scrutinized pierre . then , dropping his glass , turned slowly round upon the gentlemen near him , saying in the same peculiar , mixed , and musical voice as before :
melville	pierre	`` i do not know him ; it is an entire mistake ; why do n't the servants take him out , and the music go on ? -- -- as i was saying , miss clara , the statues you saw in the louvre are not to be mentioned with those in florence and rome . why , there now is that vaunted _chef d'oeuvre_ , the fighting gladiator of the louvre -- -- ''
melville	pierre	`` fighting gladiator it is ! '' yelled pierre , leaping toward him like spartacus . but the savage impulse in him was restrained by the alarmed female shrieks and wild gestures around him . as he paused , several gentlemen made motions to pinion him ; but shaking them off fiercely , he stood erect , and isolated for an instant , and fastening his glance upon his still reclining , and apparently unmoved cousin , thus spoke : --
melville	pierre	`` glendinning stanly , thou disown'st pierre not so abhorrently as pierre does thee . by heaven , had i a knife , glen , i could prick thee on the spot ; let out all thy glendinning blood , and then sew up the vile remainder . hound , and base blot upon the general humanity ! ''
melville	pierre	`` this is very extraordinary : -- remarkable case of combined imposture and insanity ; but where are the servants ? why do n't that black advance ? lead him out , my good doc , lead him out . carefully , carefully ! stay '' -- putting his hand in his pocket -- '' there , take that , and have the poor fellow driven off somewhere . ''
melville	pierre	bolting his rage in him , as impossible to be sated by any conduct , in such a place , pierre now turned , sprang down the stairs , and fled the house . iii . `` hack , sir ? hack , sir ? hack , sir ? ''
melville	pierre	`` cab , sir ? cab , sir ? cab , sir ? '' `` this way , sir ! this way , sir ! this way , sir ! '' `` he 's a rogue ! not him ! he 's a rogue ! '' pierre was surrounded by a crowd of contending hackmen , all holding long whips in their hands ; while others eagerly beckoned to him from their boxes , where they sat elevated between their two coach-lamps like shabby , discarded saints . the whip-stalks thickened around him , and several reports of the cracking lashes sharply sounded in his ears . just bursting from a scene so goading as his interview with the scornful glen in the dazzling drawing-room , to pierre , this sudden tumultuous surrounding of him by whip-stalks and lashes , seemed like the onset of the chastising fiends upon orestes . but , breaking away from them , he seized the first plated door-handle near him , and , leaping into the hack , shouted for whoever was the keeper of it , to mount his box forthwith and drive off in a given direction .
melville	pierre	the vehicle had proceeded some way down the great avenue when it paused , and the driver demanded whither now ; what place ? `` the watch-house of the -- -- ward , '' cried pierre . `` hi ! hi ! goin ' to deliver himself up , hey ! '' grinned the fellow to himself -- '' well , that 's a sort of honest , any way : -- g'lang , you dogs ! -- whist ! whee ! wha ! -- g'lang ! ''
melville	pierre	the sights and sounds which met the eye of pierre on re-entering the watch-house , filled him with inexpressible horror and fury . the before decent , drowsy place , now fairly reeked with all things unseemly . hardly possible was it to tell what conceivable cause or occasion had , in the comparatively short absence of pierre , collected such a base congregation . in indescribable disorder , frantic , diseased-looking men and women of all colors , and in all imaginable flaunting , immodest , grotesque , and shattered dresses , were leaping , yelling , and cursing around him . the torn madras handkerchiefs of negresses , and the red gowns of yellow girls , hanging in tatters from their naked bosoms , mixed with the rent dresses of deep-rouged white women , and the split coats , checkered vests , and protruding shirts of pale , or whiskered , or haggard , or mustached fellows of all nations , some of whom seemed scared from their beds , and others seemingly arrested in the midst of some crazy and wanton dance . on all sides , were heard drunken male and female voices , in english , french , spanish , and portuguese , interlarded now and then , with the foulest of all human lingoes , that dialect of sin and death , known as the cant language , or the flash .
melville	pierre	running among this combined babel of persons and voices , several of the police were vainly striving to still the tumult ; while others were busy handcuffing the more desperate ; and here and there the distracted wretches , both men and women , gave downright battle to the officers ; and still others already handcuffed struck out at them with their joined ironed arms . meanwhile , words and phrases unrepeatable in god 's sunlight , and whose very existence was utterly unknown , and undreamed of by tens of thousands of the decent people of the city ; syllables obscene and accursed were shouted forth in tones plainly evincing that they were the common household breath of their utterers . the thieves'-quarters , and all the brothels , lock-and-sin hospitals for incurables , and infirmaries and infernoes of hell seemed to have made one combined sortie , and poured out upon earth through the vile vomitory of some unmentionable cellar .
melville	pierre	though the hitherto imperfect and casual city experiences of pierre illy fitted him entirely to comprehend the specific purport of this terrific spectacle ; still he knew enough by hearsay of the more infamous life of the town , to imagine from whence , and who , were the objects before him . but all his consciousness at the time was absorbed by the one horrified thought of isabel and delly , forced to witness a sight hardly endurable for pierre himself ; or , possibly , sucked into the tumult , and in close personal contact with its loathsomeness . rushing into the crowd , regardless of the random blows and curses he encountered , he wildly sought for isabel , and soon descried her struggling from the delirious reaching arms of a half-clad reeling whiskerando . with an immense blow of his mailed fist , he sent the wretch humming , and seizing isabel , cried out to two officers near , to clear a path for him to the door . they did so . and in a few minutes the panting isabel was safe in the open air . he would have stayed by her , but she conjured him to return for delly , exposed to worse insults than herself . an additional posse of officers now approaching , pierre committing her to the care of one of them , and summoning two others to join himself , now re-entered the room . in another quarter of it , he saw delly seized on each hand by two bleared and half-bloody women , who with fiendish grimaces were ironically twitting her upon her close-necked dress , and had already stript her handkerchief from her . she uttered a cry of mixed anguish and joy at the sight of him ; and pierre soon succeeded in returning with her to isabel .
melville	pierre	during the absence of pierre in quest of the hack , and while isabel and delly were quietly awaiting his return , the door had suddenly burst open , and a detachment of the police drove in , and caged , the entire miscellaneous night-occupants of a notorious stew , which they had stormed and carried during the height of some outrageous orgie . the first sight of the interior of the watch-house , and their being so quickly huddled together within its four blank walls , had suddenly lashed the mob into frenzy ; so that for the time , oblivious of all other considerations , the entire force of the police was directed to the quelling of the in-door riot ; and consequently , abandoned to their own protection , isabel and delly had been temporarily left to its mercy .
melville	pierre	it was no time for pierre to manifest his indignation at the officer -- even if he could now find him -- who had thus falsified his individual pledge concerning the precious charge committed to him . nor was it any time to distress himself about his luggage , still somewhere within . quitting all , he thrust the bewildered and half-lifeless girls into the waiting hack , which , by his orders , drove back in the direction of the stand , where pierre had first taken it up .
melville	pierre	when the coach had rolled them well away from the tumult , pierre stopped it , and said to the man , that he desired to be taken to the nearest respectable hotel or boarding-house of any kind , that he knew of . the fellow -- maliciously diverted by what had happened thus far -- made some ambiguous and rudely merry rejoinder . but warned by his previous rash quarrel with the stage-driver , pierre passed this unnoticed , and in a controlled , calm , decided manner repeated his directions .
melville	pierre	the issue was , that after a rather roundabout drive they drew up in a very respectable side-street , before a large respectable-looking house , illuminated by two tall white lights flanking its portico . pierre was glad to notice some little remaining stir within , spite of the comparative lateness of the hour . a bare-headed , tidily-dressed , and very intelligent-looking man , with a broom clothes-brush in his hand , appearing , scrutinized him rather sharply at first ; but as pierre advanced further into the light , and his countenance became visible , the man , assuming a respectful but still slightly perplexed air , invited the whole party into a closely adjoining parlor , whose disordered chairs and general dustiness , evinced that after a day 's activity it now awaited the morning offices of the housemaids .
melville	pierre	`` baggage , sir ? '' `` i have left my baggage at another place , '' said pierre , `` i shall send for it to-morrow . '' `` ah ! '' exclaimed the very intelligent-looking man , rather dubiously , `` shall i discharge the hack , then ? ''
melville	pierre	`` stay , '' said pierre , bethinking him , that it would be well not to let the man know from whence they had last come , `` i will discharge it myself , thank you . '' so returning to the sidewalk , without debate , he paid the hackman an exorbitant fare , who , anxious to secure such illegal gains beyond all hope of recovery , quickly mounted his box and drove off at a gallop .
melville	pierre	`` will you step into the office , sir , now ? '' said the man , slightly flourishing with his brush -- '' this way , sir , if you please . '' pierre followed him , into an almost deserted , dimly lit room with a stand in it . going behind the stand , the man turned round to him a large ledger-like book , thickly inscribed with names , like any directory , and offered him a pen ready dipped in ink .
melville	pierre	understanding the general hint , though secretly irritated at something in the manner of the man , pierre drew the book to him , and wrote in a firm hand , at the bottom of the last-named column , --
melville	pierre	`` mr. and mrs. pierre glendinning , and miss ulver . '' the man glanced at the writing inquiringly , and then said -- '' the other column , sir -- where from . '' `` true , '' said pierre , and wrote `` saddle meadows . '' the very intelligent-looking man re-examined the page , and then slowly stroking his shaven chin , with a fork , made of his thumb for one tine , and his united four fingers for the other , said softly and whisperingly -- '' anywheres in this country , sir ? ''
melville	pierre	`` yes , in the country , '' said pierre , evasively , and bridling his ire . `` but now show me to two chambers , will you ; the one for myself and wife , i desire to have opening into another , a third one , never mind how small ; but i must have a dressing-room . ''
melville	pierre	`` dressing-room , '' repeated the man , in an ironically deliberative voice -- '' dressing-room ; -- hem ! -- you will have your luggage taken into the dressing-room , then , i suppose. -- oh , i forgot -- your luggage aint come yet -- ah , yes , yes , yes -- luggage is coming to-morrow -- oh , yes , yes , -- certainly -- to-morrow -- of course . by the way , sir ; i dislike to seem at all uncivil , and i am sure you will not deem me so ; but -- ''
melville	pierre	`` well , '' said pierre , mustering all his self-command for the coming impertinence . `` when stranger gentlemen come to this house without luggage , we think ourselves bound to ask them to pay their bills in advance , sir ; that is all , sir . ''
melville	pierre	`` i shall stay here to-night and the whole of to-morrow , at any rate , '' rejoined pierre , thankful that this was all ; `` how much will it be ? '' and he drew out his purse .
melville	pierre	the man 's eyes fastened with eagerness on the purse ; he looked from it to the face of him who held it ; then seemed half hesitating an instant ; then brightening up , said , with sudden suavity -- '' never mind , sir , never mind , sir ; though rogues sometimes be gentlemanly ; gentlemen that are gentlemen never go abroad without their diplomas . their diplomas are their friends ; and their only friends are their dollars ; you have a purse-full of friends. -- we have chambers , sir , that will exactly suit you , i think . bring your ladies and i will show you up to them immediately . '' so saying , dropping his brush , the very intelligent-looking man lighted one lamp , and taking two unlighted ones in his other hand , led the way down the dusky lead-sheeted hall , pierre following him with isabel and delly .
melville	pierre	book xvii . young america in literature . i . among the various conflicting modes of writing history , there would seem to be two grand practical distinctions , under which all the rest must subordinately range . by the one mode , all contemporaneous circumstances , facts , and events must be set down contemporaneously ; by the other , they are only to be set down as the general stream of the narrative shall dictate ; for matters which are kindred in time , may be very irrelative in themselves . i elect neither of these ; i am careless of either ; both are well enough in their way ; i write precisely as i please .
melville	pierre	in the earlier chapters of this volume , it has somewhere been passingly intimated , that pierre was not only a reader of the poets and other fine writers , but likewise -- and what is a very different thing from the other -- a thorough allegorical understander of them , a profound emotional sympathizer with them ; in other words , pierre himself possessed the poetic nature ; in himself absolutely , though but latently and floatingly , possessed every whit of the imaginative wealth which he so admired , when by vast pains-takings , and all manner of unrecompensed agonies , systematized on the printed page . not that as yet his young and immature soul had been accosted by the wonderful mutes , and through the vast halls of silent truth , had been ushered into the full , secret , eternally inviolable sanhedrim , where the poetic magi discuss , in glorious gibberish , the alpha and omega of the universe . but among the beautiful imaginings of the second and third degree of poets , he freely and comprehendingly ranged .
melville	pierre	but it still remains to be said , that pierre himself had written many a fugitive thing , which had brought him , not only vast credit and compliments from his more immediate acquaintances , but the less partial applauses of the always intelligent , and extremely discriminating public . in short , pierre had frequently done that , which many other boys have done -- published . not in the imposing form of a book , but in the more modest and becoming way of occasional contributions to magazines and other polite periodicals . his magnificent and victorious _debut_ had been made in that delightful love-sonnet , entitled `` the tropical summer . '' not only the public had applauded his gemmed little sketches of thought and fancy , whether in poetry or prose ; but the high and mighty campbell clan of editors of all sorts had bestowed upon him those generous commendations , which , with one instantaneous glance , they had immediately perceived was his due . they spoke in high terms of his surprising command of language ; they begged to express their wonder at his euphonious construction of sentences ; they regarded with reverence the pervading symmetry of his general style . but transcending even this profound insight into the deep merits of pierre , they looked infinitely beyond , and confessed their complete inability to restrain their unqualified admiration for the highly judicious smoothness and genteelness of the sentiments and fancies expressed . `` this writer , '' said one , -- in an ungovernable burst of admiring fury -- '' is characterized throughout by perfect taste . '' another , after endorsingly quoting that sapient , suppressed maxim of dr. goldsmith 's , which asserts that whatever is new is false , went on to apply it to the excellent productions before him ; concluding with this : `` he has translated the unruffled gentleman from the drawing-room into the general levee of letters ; he never permits himself to astonish ; is never betrayed into any thing coarse or new ; as assured that whatever astonishes is vulgar , and whatever is new must be crude . yes , it is the glory of this admirable young author , that vulgarity and vigor -- two inseparable adjuncts -- are equally removed from him . ''
melville	pierre	a third , perorated a long and beautifully written review , by the bold and startling announcement -- '' this writer is unquestionably a highly respectable youth . '' nor had the editors of various moral and religious periodicals failed to render the tribute of their severer appreciation , and more enviable , because more chary applause . a renowned clerical and philological conductor of a weekly publication of this kind , whose surprising proficiency in the greek , hebrew , and chaldaic , to which he had devoted by far the greater part of his life , peculiarly fitted him to pronounce unerring judgment upon works of taste in the english , had unhesitatingly delivered himself thus : -- '' he is blameless in morals , and harmless throughout . '' another , had unhesitatingly recommended his effusions to the family-circle . a third , had no reserve in saying , that the predominant end and aim of this author was evangelical piety .
melville	pierre	a mind less naturally strong than pierre 's might well have been hurried into vast self-complacency , by such eulogy as this , especially as there could be no possible doubt , that the primitive verdict pronounced by the editors was irreversible , except in the highly improbable event of the near approach of the millennium , which might establish a different dynasty of taste , and possibly eject the editors . it is true , that in view of the general practical vagueness of these panegyrics , and the circumstance that , in essence , they were all somehow of the prudently indecisive sort ; and , considering that they were panegyrics , and nothing but panegyrics , without any thing analytical about them ; an elderly friend of a literary turn , had made bold to say to our hero -- '' pierre , this is very high praise , i grant , and you are a surprisingly young author to receive it ; but i do not see any criticisms as yet . ''
melville	pierre	`` criticisms ? '' cried pierre , in amazement ; `` why , sir , they are all criticisms ! i am the idol of the critics ! '' `` ah ! '' sighed the elderly friend , as if suddenly reminded that that was true after all -- '' ah ! '' and went on with his inoffensive , non-committal cigar .
melville	pierre	nevertheless , thanks to the editors , such at last became the popular literary enthusiasm in behalf of pierre , that two young men , recently abandoning the ignoble pursuit of tailoring for the more honorable trade of the publisher ( probably with an economical view of working up in books , the linen and cotton shreds of the cutter 's counter , after having been subjected to the action of the paper-mill ) , had on the daintiest scolloped-edged paper , and in the neatest possible , and fine-needle-work hand , addressed him a letter , couched in the following terms ; the general style of which letter will sufficiently evince that , though -- thanks to the manufacturer -- their linen and cotton shreds may have been very completely transmuted into paper , yet the cutters themselves were not yet entirely out of the metamorphosing mill .
melville	pierre	`` hon . pierre glendinning , `` revered sir , `` the fine cut , the judicious fit of your productions fill us with amazement . the fabric is excellent -- the finest broadcloth of genius . we have just started in business . your pantaloons -- productions , we mean -- have never yet been collected . they should be published in the library form . the tailors -- we mean the librarians , demand it . your fame is now in its finest nap . now -- before the gloss is off -- now is the time for the library form . we have recently received an invoice of chamois -- -- russia leather . the library form should be a durable form . we respectfully offer to dress your amazing productions in the library form . if you please , we will transmit you a sample of the cloth -- -- we mean a sample-page , with a pattern of the leather . we are ready to give you one tenth of the profits ( less discount ) for the privilege of arraying your wonderful productions in the library form : -- you cashing the seamstresses ' -- -- printer 's and binder 's bills on the day of publication . an answer at your earliest convenience will greatly oblige , --
melville	pierre	`` sir , your most obsequious servants , `` wonder & wen . '' `` p. s. -- we respectfully submit the enclosed block -- -- sheet , as some earnest of our intentions to do every thing in your behalf possible to any firm in the trade .
melville	pierre	`` n . b. -- if the list does not comprise all your illustrious wardrobe -- -- works , we mean -- -- , we shall exceedingly regret it . we have hunted through all the drawers -- -- magazines . `` sample of a coat -- -- title for the works of glendinning :
melville	pierre	the complete works of glendinning , author of _that world-famed production_ , `` _the tropical summer : a sonnet._ '' `` _the weather : a thought._ '' `` _life : an impromptu._ '' `` _the late reverend mark graceman : an obituary._ '' `` _honor : a stanza._ '' `` _beauty : an acrostic._ '' `` _edgar : an anagram._ '' `` _the pippin : a paragraph._ '' _ & c . & c. & c. & c. & c. & c. & c. & c. & c. & c._ ''
melville	pierre	p from a designer , pierre had received the following : `` sir : i approach you with unfeigned trepidation . for though you are young in age , you are old in fame and ability . i can not express to you my ardent admiration of your works ; nor can i but deeply regret that the productions of such graphic descriptive power , should be unaccompanied by the humbler illustrative labors of the designer . my services in this line are entirely at your command . i need not say how proud i should be , if this hint , on my part , however presuming , should induce you to reply in terms upon which i could found the hope of honoring myself and my profession by a few designs for the works of the illustrious glendinning . but the cursory mention of your name here fills me with such swelling emotions , that i can say nothing more . i would only add , however , that not being at all connected with the trade , my business situation unpleasantly forces me to make cash down on delivery of each design , the basis of all my professional arrangements . your noble soul , however , would disdain to suppose , that this sordid necessity , in my merely business concerns , could ever impair -- --
melville	pierre	`` that profound private veneration and admiration with which i unmercenarily am , great and good glendinning , yours most humbly , peter pence . '' ii . these were stirring letters . the library form ! an illustrated edition ! his whole heart swelled .
melville	pierre	but unfortunately it occurred to pierre , that as all his writings were not only fugitive , but if put together could not possibly fill more than a very small duodecimo ; therefore the library edition seemed a little premature , perhaps ; possibly , in a slight degree , preposterous . then , as they were chiefly made up of little sonnets , brief meditative poems , and moral essays , the matter for the designer ran some small risk of being but meager . in his inexperience , he did not know that such was the great height of invention to which the designer 's art had been carried , that certain gentlemen of that profession had gone to an eminent publishing-house with overtures for an illustrated edition of `` coke upon lyttleton . '' even the city directory was beautifully illustrated with exquisite engravings of bricks , tongs , and flat-irons .
melville	pierre	concerning the draught for the title-page , it must be confessed , that on seeing the imposing enumeration of his titles -- long and magnificent as those preceding the proclamations of some german prince ( `` _hereditary lord of the back-yard of crantz jacobi ; undoubted proprietor by seizure of the bedstead of the late widow van lorn ; heir apparent to the bankrupt bakery of fletz and flitz ; residuary legatee of the confiscated pin-money of the late dowager dunker ; & c. & c. & c._ '' ) pierre could not entirely repress a momentary feeling of elation . yet did he also bow low under the weight of his own ponderosity , as the author of such a vast load of literature . it occasioned him some slight misgivings , however , when he considered , that already in his eighteenth year , his title-page should so immensely surpass in voluminous statisticals the simple page , which in his father 's edition prefixed the vast speculations of plato . still , he comforted himself with the thought , that as he could not presume to interfere with the bill-stickers of the gazelle magazine , who every month covered the walls of the city with gigantic announcements of his name among the other contributors ; so neither could he now -- in the highly improbable event of closing with the offer of messrs. wonder and wen -- presume to interfere with the bill-sticking department of their business concern ; for it was plain that they esteemed one 's title-page but another unwindowed wall , infinitely more available than most walls , since here was at least one spot in the city where no rival bill-stickers dared to encroach . nevertheless , resolved as he was to let all such bill-sticking matters take care of themselves , he was sensible of some coy inclination toward that modest method of certain kid-gloved and dainty authors , who scorning the vulgarity of a sounding parade , contented themselves with simply subscribing their name to the title-page ; as confident , that that was sufficient guarantee to the notice of all true gentlemen of taste . it was for petty german princes to sound their prolonged titular flourishes . the czar of russia contented himself with putting the simple word `` nicholas '' to his loftiest decrees .
melville	pierre	this train of thought terminated at last in various considerations upon the subject of anonymousness in authorship . he regretted that he had not started his literary career under that mask . at present , it might be too late ; already the whole universe knew him , and it was in vain at this late day to attempt to hood himself . but when he considered the essential dignity and propriety at all points , of the inviolably anonymous method , he could not but feel the sincerest sympathy for those unfortunate fellows , who , not only naturally averse to any sort of publicity , but progressively ashamed of their own successive productions -- written chiefly for the merest cash -- were yet cruelly coerced into sounding title-pages by sundry baker 's and butcher 's bills , and other financial considerations ; inasmuch as the placard of the title-page indubitably must assist the publisher in his sales .
melville	pierre	but perhaps the ruling , though not altogether conscious motive of pierre in finally declining -- as he did -- the services of messrs. wonder and wen , those eager applicants for the privilege of extending and solidifying his fame , arose from the idea that being at this time not very far advanced in years , the probability was , that his future productions might at least equal , if not surpass , in some small degree , those already given to the world . he resolved to wait for his literary canonization until he should at least have outgrown the sophomorean insinuation of the law ; which , with a singular affectation of benignity , pronounced him an `` infant . '' his modesty obscured from him the circumstance , that the greatest lettered celebrities of the time , had , by the divine power of genius , become full graduates in the university of fame , while yet as legal minors forced to go to their mammas for pennies wherewith to keep them in peanuts .
melville	pierre	not seldom pierre 's social placidity was ruffled by polite entreaties from the young ladies that he would be pleased to grace their albums with some nice little song . we say that here his social placidity was ruffled ; for the true charm of agreeable parlor society is , that there you lose your own sharp individuality and become delightfully merged in that soft social pantheism , as it were , that rosy melting of all into one , ever prevailing in those drawing-rooms , which pacifically and deliciously belie their own name ; inasmuch as there no one draws the sword of his own individuality , but all such ugly weapons are left -- as of old -- with your hat and cane in the hall . it was very awkward to decline the albums ; but somehow it was still worse , and peculiarly distasteful for pierre to comply . with equal justice apparently , you might either have called this his weakness or his idiosyncrasy . he summoned all his suavity , and refused . and the refusal of pierre -- according to miss angelica amabilia of ambleside -- was sweeter than the compliance of others . but then -- prior to the proffer of her album -- in a copse at ambleside , pierre in a gallant whim had in the lady 's own presence voluntarily carved miss angelica 's initials upon the bark of a beautiful maple . but all young ladies are not miss angelicas . blandly denied in the parlor , they courted repulse in the study . in lovely envelopes they dispatched their albums to pierre , not omitting to drop a little attar-of-rose in the palm of the domestic who carried them . while now pierre -- pushed to the wall in his gallantry -- shilly-shallied as to what he must do , the awaiting albums multiplied upon him ; and by-and-by monopolized an entire shelf in his chamber ; so that while their combined ornate bindings fairly dazzled his eyes , their excessive redolence all but made him to faint , though indeed , in moderation , he was very partial to perfumes . so that of really chilly afternoons , he was still obliged to drop the upper sashes a few inches .
melville	pierre	the simplest of all things it is to write in a lady 's album . but cui bono ? is there such a dearth of printed reading , that the monkish times must be revived , and ladies books be in manuscript ? what could pierre write of his own on love or any thing else , that would surpass what divine hafiz wrote so many long centuries ago ? was there not anacreon too , and catullus , and ovid -- all translated , and readily accessible ? and then -- bless all their souls ! -- had the dear creatures forgotten tom moore ? but the handwriting , pierre , -- they want the sight of your hand . well , thought pierre , actual feeling is better than transmitted sight , any day . i will give them the actual feeling of my hand , as much as they want . and lips are still better than hands . let them send their sweet faces to me , and i will kiss _lipographs_ upon them forever and a day . this was a felicitous idea . he called dates , and had the albums carried down by the basket-full into the dining-room . he opened and spread them all out upon the extension-table there ; then , modeling himself by the pope , when his holiness collectively blesses long crates of rosaries -- he waved one devout kiss to the albums ; and summoning three servants sent the albums all home , with his best compliments , accompanied with a confectioner 's _kiss_ for each album , rolled up in the most ethereal tissue .
melville	pierre	from various quarters of the land , both town and country , and especially during the preliminary season of autumn , pierre received various pressing invitations to lecture before lyceums , young men 's associations , and other literary and scientific societies . the letters conveying these invitations possessed quite an imposing and most flattering aspect to the unsophisticated pierre . one was as follows : --
melville	pierre	`` _urquhartian club for the immediate extension of the limits of all knowledge , both human and divine._ `` zadockprattsville , `` _june 11th , 18 -- _ . `` _author of the 'tropical summer , ' & c._ `` honored and dear sir : --
melville	pierre	`` official duty and private inclination in this present case most delightfully blend . what was the ardent desire of my heart , has now by the action of the _committee on lectures_ become professionally obligatory upon me . as chairman of our _committee on lectures_ , i hereby beg the privilege of entreating that you will honor this society by lecturing before it on any subject you may choose , and at any day most convenient to yourself . the subject of human destiny we would respectfully suggest , without however at all wishing to impede you in your own unbiased selection .
melville	pierre	`` if you honor us by complying with this invitation , be assured , sir , that the committee on lectures will take the best care of you throughout your stay , and endeavor to make zadockprattsville agreeable to you . a carriage will be in attendance at the stage-house to convey yourself and luggage to the inn , under full escort of the _committee on lectures_ , with the chairman at their head .
melville	pierre	`` permit me to join my private homage to my high official consideration for you , and to subscribe myself very humbly your servant , donald dundonald . '' iii . but it was more especially the lecture invitations coming from venerable , gray-headed metropolitan societies , and indited by venerable gray-headed secretaries , which far from elating filled the youthful pierre with the sincerest sense of humility . lecture ? lecture ? such a stripling as i lecture to fifty benches , with ten gray heads on each ? five hundred gray heads in all ! shall my one , poor , inexperienced brain presume to lay down the law in a lecture to five hundred life-ripened understandings ? it seemed too absurd for thought . yet the five hundred , through their spokesman , had voluntarily extended this identical invitation to him . then how could it be otherwise , than that an incipient timonism should slide into pierre , when he considered all the disgraceful inferences to be derived from such a fact . he called to mind , how that once upon a time , during a visit of his to the city , the police were called out to quell a portentous riot , occasioned by the vast press and contention for seats at the first lecture of an illustrious lad of nineteen , the author of `` a week at coney island . ''
melville	pierre	it is needless to say that pierre most conscientiously and respectfully declined all polite overtures of this sort . similar disenchantments of his cooler judgment did likewise deprive of their full lusciousness several other equally marked demonstrations of his literary celebrity . applications for autographs showered in upon him ; but in sometimes humorously gratifying the more urgent requests of these singular people pierre could not but feel a pang of regret , that owing to the very youthful and quite unformed character of his handwriting , his signature did not possess that inflexible uniformity , which -- for mere prudential reasons , if nothing more -- should always mark the hand of illustrious men . his heart thrilled with sympathetic anguish for posterity , which would be certain to stand hopelessly perplexed before so many contradictory signatures of one supereminent name . alas ! posterity would be sure to conclude that they were forgeries all ; that no chirographic relic of the sublime poet glendinning survived to their miserable times .
melville	pierre	from the proprietors of the magazines whose pages were honored by his effusions , he received very pressing epistolary solicitations for the loan of his portrait in oil , in order to take an engraving therefrom , for a frontispiece to their periodicals . but here again the most melancholy considerations obtruded . it had always been one of the lesser ambitions of pierre , to sport a flowing beard , which he deemed the most noble corporeal badge of the man , not to speak of the illustrious author . but as yet he was beardless ; and no cunning compound of rowland and son could force a beard which should arrive at maturity in any reasonable time for the frontispiece . besides , his boyish features and whole expression were daily changing . would he lend his authority to this unprincipled imposture upon posterity ? honor forbade .
melville	pierre	these epistolary petitions were generally couched in an elaborately respectful style ; thereby intimating with what deep reverence his portrait would be handled , while unavoidably subjected to the discipline indispensable to obtain from it the engraved copy they prayed for . but one or two of the persons who made occasional oral requisitions upon him in this matter of his engraved portrait , seemed less regardful of the inherent respect due to every man 's portrait , much more , to that of a genius so celebrated as pierre . they did not even seem to remember that the portrait of any man generally receives , and indeed is entitled to more reverence than the original man himself ; since one may freely clap a celebrated friend on the shoulder , yet would by no means tweak his nose in his portrait . the reason whereof may be this : that the portrait is better entitled to reverence than the man ; inasmuch as nothing belittling can be imagined concerning the portrait , whereas many unavoidably belittling things can be fancied as touching the man .
melville	pierre	upon one occasion , happening suddenly to encounter a literary acquaintance -- a joint editor of the `` captain kidd monthly '' -- who suddenly popped upon him round a corner , pierre was startled by a rapid -- '' good-morning , good-morning ; -- just the man i wanted : -- come , step round now with me , and have your daguerreotype taken ; -- get it engraved then in no time ; -- want it for the next issue . ''
melville	pierre	so saying , this chief mate of captain kidd seized pierre 's arm , and in the most vigorous manner was walking him off , like an officer a pickpocket , when pierre civilly said -- '' pray , sir , hold , if you please , i shall do no such thing . '' -- '' pooh , pooh -- must have it -- public property -- come along -- only a door or two now . '' -- '' public property ! '' rejoined pierre , `` that may do very well for the 'captain kidd monthly ; ' -- it 's very captain kiddish to say so . but i beg to repeat that i do not intend to accede. '' -- '' do n't ? really ? '' cried the other , amazedly staring pierre full in the countenance ; -- '' why bless your soul , _my_ portrait is published -- long ago published ! '' -- '' ca n't help that , sir '' -- said pierre . `` oh ! come along , come along , '' and the chief mate seized him again with the most uncompunctious familiarity by the arm . though the sweetest-tempered youth in the world when but decently treated , pierre had an ugly devil in him sometimes , very apt to be evoked by the personal profaneness of gentlemen of the captain kidd school of literature . `` look you , my good fellow , '' said he , submitting to his impartial inspection a determinately double fist , -- '' drop my arm now -- or i 'll drop you . to the devil with you and your daguerreotype ! ''
melville	pierre	this incident , suggestive as it was at the time , in the sequel had a surprising effect upon pierre . for he considered with what infinite readiness now , the most faithful portrait of any one could be taken by the daguerreotype , whereas in former times a faithful portrait was only within the power of the moneyed , or mental aristocrats of the earth . how natural then the inference , that instead , as in old times , immortalizing a genius , a portrait now only _dayalized_ a dunce . besides , when every body has his portrait published , true distinction lies in not having yours published at all . for if you are published along with tom , dick , and harry , and wear a coat of their cut , how then are you distinct from tom , dick , and harry ? therefore , even so miserable a motive as downright personal vanity helped to operate in this matter with pierre .
melville	pierre	some zealous lovers of the general literature of the age , as well as declared devotees to his own great genius , frequently petitioned him for the materials wherewith to frame his biography . they assured him , that life of all things was most insecure . he might feel many years in him yet ; time might go lightly by him ; but in any sudden and fatal sickness , how would his last hours be embittered by the thought , that he was about to depart forever , leaving the world utterly unprovided with the knowledge of what were the precise texture and hue of the first trowsers he wore . these representations did certainly touch him in a very tender spot , not previously unknown to the schoolmaster . but when pierre considered , that owing to his extreme youth , his own recollections of the past soon merged into all manner of half-memories and a general vagueness , he could not find it in his conscience to present such materials to the impatient biographers , especially as his chief verifying authority in these matters of his past career , was now eternally departed beyond all human appeal . his excellent nurse clarissa had been dead four years and more . in vain a young literary friend , the well-known author of two indexes and one epic , to whom the subject happened to be mentioned , warmly espoused the cause of the distressed biographers ; saying that however unpleasant , one must needs pay the penalty of celebrity ; it was no use to stand back ; and concluded by taking from the crown of his hat the proof-sheets of his own biography , which , with the most thoughtful consideration for the masses , was shortly to be published in the pamphlet form , price only a shilling .
melville	pierre	it only the more bewildered and pained him , when still other and less delicate applicants sent him their regularly printed _biographico-solicito circulars_ , with his name written in ink ; begging him to honor them and the world with a neat draft of his life , including criticisms on his own writings ; the printed circular indiscriminately protesting , that undoubtedly he knew more of his own life than any other living man ; and that only he who had put together the great works of glendinning could be fully qualified thoroughly to analyze them , and cast the ultimate judgment upon their remarkable construction .
melville	pierre	now , it was under the influence of the humiliating emotions engendered by things like the above ; it was when thus haunted by publishers , engravers , editors , critics , autograph-collectors , portrait-fanciers , biographers , and petitioning and remonstrating literary friends of all sorts ; it was then , that there stole into the youthful soul of pierre , melancholy forebodings of the utter unsatisfactoriness of all human fame ; since the most ardent profferings of the most martyrizing demonstrations in his behalf , -- these he was sorrowfully obliged to turn away .
melville	pierre	and it may well be believed , that after the wonderful vital world-revelation so suddenly made to pierre at the meadows -- a revelation which , at moments , in some certain things , fairly timonized him -- he had not failed to clutch with peculiar nervous detestation and contempt that ample parcel , containing the letters of his biographico and other silly correspondents , which , in a less ferocious hour , he had filed away as curiosities . it was with an almost infernal grin , that he saw that particular heap of rubbish eternally quenched in the fire , and felt that as it was consumed before his eyes , so in his soul was forever killed the last and minutest undeveloped microscopic germ of that most despicable vanity to which those absurd correspondents thought to appeal .
melville	pierre	book xviii . pierre , as a juvenile author , reconsidered . i. inasmuch as by various indirect intimations much more than ordinary natural genius has been imputed to pierre , it may have seemed an inconsistency , that only the merest magazine papers should have been thus far the sole productions of his mind . nor need it be added , that , in the soberest earnest , those papers contained nothing uncommon ; indeed -- entirely now to drop all irony , if hitherto any thing like that has been indulged in -- those fugitive things of master pierre 's were the veriest common-place .
melville	pierre	it is true , as i long before said , that nature at saddle meadows had very early been as a benediction to pierre ; -- had blown her wind-clarion to him from the blue hills , and murmured melodious secrecies to him by her streams and her woods . but while nature thus very early and very abundantly feeds us , she is very late in tutoring us as to the proper methodization of our diet . or , -- to change the metaphor , -- there are immense quarries of fine marble ; but how to get it out ; how to chisel it ; how to construct any temple ? youth must wholly quit , then , the quarry , for awhile ; and not only go forth , and get tools to use in the quarry , but must go and thoroughly study architecture . now the quarry-discoverer is long before the stone-cutter ; and the stone-cutter is long before the architect ; and the architect is long before the temple ; for the temple is the crown of the world .
melville	pierre	yes ; pierre was not only very unarchitectural at that time , but pierre was very young , indeed , at that time . and it is often to be observed , that as in digging for precious metals in the mines , much earthy rubbish has first to be troublesomely handled and thrown out ; so , in digging in one 's soul for the fine gold of genius , much dullness and common-place is first brought to light . happy would it be , if the man possessed in himself some receptacle for his own rubbish of this sort : but he is like the occupant of a dwelling , whose refuse can not be clapped into his own cellar , but must be deposited in the street before his own door , for the public functionaries to take care of . no common-place is ever effectually got rid of , except by essentially emptying one 's self of it into a book ; for once trapped in a book , then the book can be put into the fire , and all will be well . but they are not always put into the fire ; and this accounts for the vast majority of miserable books over those of positive merit . nor will any thoroughly sincere man , who is an author , ever be rash in precisely defining the period , when he has completely ridded himself of his rubbish , and come to the latent gold in his mine . it holds true , in every case , that the wiser a man is , the more misgivings he has on certain points .
melville	pierre	it is well enough known , that the best productions of the best human intellects , are generally regarded by those intellects as mere immature freshman exercises , wholly worthless in themselves , except as initiatives for entering the great university of god after death . certain it is , that if any inferences can be drawn from observations of the familiar lives of men of the greatest mark , their finest things , those which become the foolish glory of the world , are not only very poor and inconsiderable to themselves , but often positively distasteful ; they would rather not have the book in the room . in minds comparatively inferior as compared with the above , these surmising considerations so sadden and unfit , that they become careless of what they write ; go to their desks with discontent , and only remain there -- victims to headache , and pain in the back -- by the hard constraint of some social necessity . equally paltry and despicable to them , are the works thus composed ; born of unwillingness and the bill of the baker ; the rickety offspring of a parent , careless of life herself , and reckless of the germ-life she contains . let not the short-sighted world for a moment imagine , that any vanity lurks in such minds ; only hired to appear on the stage , not voluntarily claiming the public attention ; their utmost life-redness and glow is but rouge , washed off in private with bitterest tears ; their laugh only rings because it is hollow ; and the answering laugh is no laughter to them .
melville	pierre	there is nothing so slipperily alluring as sadness ; we become sad in the first place by having nothing stirring to do ; we continue in it , because we have found a snug sofa at last . even so , it may possibly be , that arrived at this quiet retrospective little episode in the career of my hero -- this shallowly expansive embayed tappan zee of my otherwise deep-heady hudson -- i too begin to loungingly expand , and wax harmlessly sad and sentimental .
melville	pierre	now , what has been hitherto presented in reference to pierre , concerning rubbish , as in some cases the unavoidable first-fruits of genius , is in no wise contradicted by the fact , that the first published works of many meritorious authors have given mature token of genius ; for we do not know how many they previously published to the flames ; or privately published in their own brains , and suppressed there as quickly . and in the inferior instances of an immediate literary success , in very young writers , it will be almost invariably observable , that for that instant success they were chiefly indebted to some rich and peculiar experience in life , embodied in a book , which because , for that cause , containing original matter , the author himself , forsooth , is to be considered original ; in this way , many very original books , being the product of very unoriginal minds . indeed , man has only to be but a little circumspect , and away flies the last rag of his vanity . the world is forever babbling of originality ; but there never yet was an original man , in the sense intended by the world ; the first man himself -- who according to the rabbins was also the first author -- not being an original ; the only original author being god . had milton 's been the lot of caspar hauser , milton would have been vacant as he . for though the naked soul of man doth assuredly contain one latent element of intellectual productiveness ; yet never was there a child born solely from one parent ; the visible world of experience being that procreative thing which impregnates the muses ; self-reciprocally efficient hermaphrodites being but a fable .
melville	pierre	there is infinite nonsense in the world on all of these matters ; hence blame me not if i contribute my mite . it is impossible to talk or to write without apparently throwing oneself helplessly open ; the invulnerable knight wears his visor down . still , it is pleasant to chat ; for it passes the time ere we go to our beds ; and speech is farther incited , when like strolling improvisatores of italy , we are paid for our breath . and we are only too thankful when the gapes of the audience dismiss us with the few ducats we earn .
melville	pierre	ii . it may have been already inferred , that the pecuniary plans of pierre touching his independent means of support in the city were based upon his presumed literary capabilities . for what else could he do ? he knew no profession , no trade . glad now perhaps might he have been , if fate had made him a blacksmith , and not a gentleman , a glendinning , and a genius . but here he would have been unpardonably rash , had he not already , in some degree , actually tested the fact , in his own personal experience , that it is not altogether impossible for a magazine contributor to juvenile american literature to receive a few pence in exchange for his ditties . such cases stand upon imperishable record , and it were both folly and ingratitude to disown them .
melville	pierre	but since the fine social position and noble patrimony of pierre , had thus far rendered it altogether unnecessary for him to earn the least farthing of his own in the world , whether by hand or by brain ; it may seem desirable to explain a little here as we go . we shall do so , but always including , the preamble .
melville	pierre	sometimes every possible maxim or thought seems an old one ; yet it is among the elder of the things in that unaugmentable stock , that never mind what one 's situation may be , however prosperous and happy , he will still be impatient of it ; he will still reach out of himself , and beyond every present condition . so , while many a poor be-inked galley-slave , toiling with the heavy oar of a quill , to gain something wherewithal to stave off the cravings of nature ; and in his hours of morbid self-reproach , regarding his paltry wages , at all events , as an unavoidable disgrace to him ; while this galley-slave of letters would have leaped with delight -- reckless of the feeble seams of his pantaloons -- at the most distant prospect of inheriting the broad farms of saddle meadows , lord of an all-sufficing income , and forever exempt from wearing on his hands those treacherous plague-spots of indigence -- videlicet , blots from the inkstand ; -- pierre himself , the undoubted and actual possessor of the things only longingly and hopelessly imagined by the other ; the then top of pierre 's worldly ambition , was the being able to boast that he had written such matters as publishers would pay something for in the way of a mere business transaction , which they thought would prove profitable . yet altogether weak and silly as this may seem in pierre , let us preambillically examine a little further , and see if it be so indeed .
melville	pierre	pierre was proud ; and a proud man -- proud with the sort of pride now meant -- ever holds but lightly those things , however beneficent , which he did not for himself procure . were such pride carried out to its legitimate end , the man would eat no bread , the seeds whereof he had not himself put into the soil , not entirely without humiliation , that even that seed must be borrowed from some previous planter . a proud man likes to feel himself in himself , and not by reflection in others . he likes to be not only his own alpha and omega , but to be distinctly all the intermediate gradations , and then to slope off on his own spine either way , into the endless impalpable ether . what a glory it was then to pierre , when first in his two gentlemanly hands he jingled the wages of labor ! talk of drums and the fife ; the echo of coin of one 's own earning is more inspiring than all the trumpets of sparta . how disdainfully now he eyed the sumptuousness of his hereditary halls -- the hangings , and the pictures , and the bragging historic armorials and the banners of the glendinning renown ; confident , that if need should come , he would not be forced to turn resurrectionist , and dig up his grandfather 's indian-chief grave for the ancestral sword and shield , ignominiously to pawn them for a living ! he could live on himself . oh , twice-blessed now , in the feeling of practical capacity , was pierre .
melville	pierre	the mechanic , the day-laborer , has but one way to live ; his body must provide for his body . but not only could pierre in some sort , do that ; he could do the other ; and letting his body stay lazily at home , send off his soul to labor , and his soul would come faithfully back and pay his body her wages . so , some unprofessional gentlemen of the aristocratic south , who happen to own slaves , give those slaves liberty to go and seek work , and every night return with their wages , which constitute those idle gentlemen 's income . both ambidexter and quadruple-armed is that man , who in a day-laborer 's body , possesses a day-laboring soul . yet let not such an one be over-confident . our god is a jealous god ; he wills not that any man should permanently possess the least shadow of his own self-sufficient attributes . yoke the body to the soul , and put both to the plough , and the one or the other must in the end assuredly drop in the furrow . keep , then , thy body effeminate for labor , and thy soul laboriously robust ; or else thy soul effeminate for labor , and thy body laboriously robust . elect ! the two will not lastingly abide in one yoke . thus over the most vigorous and soaring conceits , doth the cloud of truth come stealing ; thus doth the shot , even of a sixty-two-pounder pointed upward , light at last on the earth ; for strive we how we may , we can not overshoot the earth 's orbit , to receive the attractions of other planets ; earth 's law of gravitation extends far beyond her own atmosphere .
melville	pierre	in the operative opinion of this world , he who is already fully provided with what is necessary for him , that man shall have more ; while he who is deplorably destitute of the same , he shall have taken away from him even that which he hath . yet the world vows it is a very plain , downright matter-of-fact , plodding , humane sort of world . it is governed only by the simplest principles , and scorns all ambiguities , all transcendentals , and all manner of juggling . now some imaginatively heterodoxical men are often surprisingly twitted upon their willful inverting of all common-sense notions , their absurd and all-displacing transcendentals , which say three is four , and two and two make ten . but if the eminent jugglarius himself ever advocated in mere words a doctrine one thousandth part so ridiculous and subversive of all practical sense , as that doctrine which the world actually and eternally practices , of giving unto him who already hath more than enough , still more of the superfluous article , and taking away from him who hath nothing at all , even that which he hath , -- then is the truest book in the world a lie .
melville	pierre	wherefore we see that the so-called transcendentalists are not the only people who deal in transcendentals . on the contrary , we seem to see that the utilitarians , -- the every-day world 's people themselves , far transcend those inferior transcendentalists by their own incomprehensible worldly maxims . and -- what is vastly more -- with the one party , their transcendentals are but theoretic and inactive , and therefore harmless ; whereas with the other , they are actually clothed in living deeds .
melville	pierre	the highly graveling doctrine and practice of the world , above cited , had in some small degree been manifested in the case of pierre . he prospectively possessed the fee of several hundred farms scattered over part of two adjoining counties ; and now the proprietor of that popular periodical , the gazelle magazine , sent him several additional dollars for his sonnets . that proprietor ( though in sooth , he never read the sonnets , but referred them to his professional adviser ; and was so ignorant , that , for a long time previous to the periodical 's actually being started , he insisted upon spelling the gazelle with a _g_ for the _z_ , as thus : _gagelle_ ; maintaining , that in the gazelle connection , the _z_ was a mere impostor , and that the _g_ was soft ; for he was a judge of softness , and could speak from experience ) ; that proprietor was undoubtedly a transcendentalist ; for did he not act upon the transcendental doctrine previously set forth ?
melville	pierre	now , the dollars derived from his ditties , these pierre had always invested in cigars ; so that the puffs which indirectly brought him his dollars were again returned , but as perfumed puffs ; perfumed with the sweet leaf of havanna . so that this highly-celebrated and world-renowned pierre -- the great author -- whose likeness the world had never seen ( for had he not repeatedly refused the world his likeness ? ) , this famous poet , and philosopher , author of `` _the tropical summer : a sonnet_ ; '' against whose very life several desperadoes were darkly plotting ( for had not the biographers sworn they would have it ! ) ; this towering celebrity -- there he would sit smoking , and smoking , mild and self-festooned as a vapory mountain . it was very involuntarily and satisfactorily reciprocal . his cigars were lighted in two ways : lighted by the sale of his sonnets , and lighted by the printed sonnets themselves .
melville	pierre	for even at that early time in his authorial life , pierre , however vain of his fame , was not at all proud of his paper . not only did he make allumettes of his sonnets when published , but was very careless about his discarded manuscripts ; they were to be found lying all round the house ; gave a great deal of trouble to the housemaids in sweeping ; went for kindlings to the fires ; and were forever flitting out of the windows , and under the door-sills , into the faces of people passing the manorial mansion . in this reckless , indifferent way of his , pierre himself was a sort of publisher . it is true his more familiar admirers often earnestly remonstrated with him , against this irreverence to the primitive vestments of his immortal productions ; saying , that whatever had once felt the nib of his mighty pen , was thenceforth sacred as the lips which had but once saluted the great toe of the pope . but hardened as he was to these friendly censurings , pierre never forbade that ardent appreciation of `` the tear , '' who , finding a small fragment of the original manuscript containing a dot ( _tear_ ) , over an _i_ ( _eye_ ) , esteemed the significant event providential ; and begged the distinguished favor of being permitted to have it for a brooch ; and ousted a cameo-head of homer , to replace it with the more invaluable gem . he became inconsolable , when being caught in a rain , the dot ( _tear_ ) disappeared from over the _i_ ( _eye_ ) ; so that the strangeness and wonderfulness of the sonnet was still conspicuous ; in that though the least fragment of it could weep in a drought , yet did it become all tearless in a shower .
melville	pierre	but this indifferent and supercilious amateur -- deaf to the admiration of the world ; the enigmatically merry and renowned author of `` the tear ; '' the pride of the gazelle magazine , on whose flaunting cover his name figured at the head of all contributors -- ( no small men either ; for their lives had all been fraternally written by each other , and they had clubbed , and had their likenesses all taken by the aggregate job , and published on paper , all bought at one shop ) this high-prestiged pierre -- whose future popularity and voluminousness had become so startlingly announced by what he had already written , that certain speculators came to the meadows to survey its water-power , if any , with a view to start a paper-mill expressly for the great author , and so monopolize his stationery dealings ; -- this vast being , -- spoken of with awe by all merely youthful aspirants for fame ; this age-neutralizing pierre ; -- before whom an old gentleman of sixty-five , formerly librarian to congress , on being introduced to him at the magazine publishers ' , devoutly took off his hat , and kept it so , and remained standing , though pierre was socially seated with his hat on ; -- this wonderful , disdainful genius -- but only life-amateur as yet -- is now soon to appear in a far different guise . he shall now learn , and very bitterly learn , that though the world worship mediocrity and common place , yet hath it fire and sword for all cotemporary grandeur ; that though it swears that it fiercely assails all hypocrisy , yet hath it not always an ear for earnestness .
melville	pierre	and though this state of things , united with the ever multiplying freshets of new books , seems inevitably to point to a coming time , when the mass of humanity reduced to one level of dotage , authors shall be scarce as alchymists are to-day , and the printing-press be reckoned a small invention : -- yet even now , in the foretaste of this let us hug ourselves , oh , my aurelian ! that though the age of authors be passing , the hours of earnestness shall remain !
melville	pierre	book xix . the church of the apostles . i . in the lower old-fashioned part of the city , in a narrow street -- almost a lane -- once filled with demure-looking dwellings , but now chiefly with immense lofty warehouses of foreign importers ; and not far from the corner where the lane intersected with a very considerable but contracted thoroughfare for merchants and their clerks , and their carmen and porters ; stood at this period a rather singular and ancient edifice , a relic of the more primitive time . the material was a grayish stone , rudely cut and masoned into walls of surprising thickness and strength ; along two of which walls -- the side ones -- were distributed as many rows of arched and stately windows . a capacious , square , and wholly unornamented tower rose in front to twice the height of the body of the church ; three sides of this tower were pierced with small and narrow apertures . thus far , in its external aspect , the building -- now more than a century old , -- sufficiently attested for what purpose it had originally been founded . in its rear , was a large and lofty plain brick structure , with its front to the rearward street , but its back presented to the back of the church , leaving a small , flagged , and quadrangular vacancy between . at the sides of this quadrangle , three stories of homely brick colonnades afforded covered communication between the ancient church , and its less elderly adjunct . a dismantled , rusted , and forlorn old railing of iron fencing in a small courtyard in front of the rearward building , seemed to hint , that the latter had usurped an unoccupied space formerly sacred as the old church 's burial inclosure . such a fancy would have been entirely true . built when that part of the city was devoted to private residences , and not to warehouses and offices as now , the old church of the apostles had had its days of sanctification and grace ; but the tide of change and progress had rolled clean through its broad-aisle and side-aisles , and swept by far the greater part of its congregation two or three miles up town . some stubborn and elderly old merchants and accountants , lingered awhile among its dusty pews , listening to the exhortations of a faithful old pastor , who , sticking to his post in this flight of his congregation , still propped his half-palsied form in the worm-eaten pulpit , and occasionally pounded -- though now with less vigorous hand -- the moth-eaten covering of its desk . but it came to pass , that this good old clergyman died ; and when the gray-headed and bald-headed remaining merchants and accountants followed his coffin out of the broad-aisle to see it reverently interred ; then that was the last time that ever the old edifice witnessed the departure of a regular worshiping assembly from its walls . the venerable merchants and accountants held a meeting , at which it was finally decided , that , hard and unwelcome as the necessity might be , yet it was now no use to disguise the fact , that the building could no longer be efficiently devoted to its primitive purpose . it must be divided into stores ; cut into offices ; and given for a roost to the gregarious lawyers . this intention was executed , even to the making offices high up in the tower ; and so well did the thing succeed , that ultimately the church-yard was invaded for a supplemental edifice , likewise to be promiscuously rented to the legal crowd . but this new building very much exceeded the body of the church in height . it was some seven stories ; a fearful pile of titanic bricks , lifting its tiled roof almost to a level with the top of the sacred tower .
melville	pierre	in this ambitious erection the proprietors went a few steps , or rather a few stories , too far . for as people would seldom willingly fall into legal altercations unless the lawyers were always very handy to help them ; so it is ever an object with lawyers to have their offices as convenient as feasible to the street ; on the ground-floor , if possible , without a single acclivity of a step ; but at any rate not in the seventh story of any house , where their clients might be deterred from employing them at all , if they were compelled to mount seven long flights of stairs , one over the other , with very brief landings , in order even to pay their preliminary retaining fees . so , from some time after its throwing open , the upper stories of the less ancient attached edifice remained almost wholly without occupants ; and by the forlorn echoes of their vacuities , right over the head of the business-thriving legal gentlemen below , must -- to some few of them at least -- have suggested unwelcome similitudes , having reference to the crowded state of their basement-pockets , as compared with the melancholy condition of their attics ; -- alas ! full purses and empty heads ! this dreary posture of affairs , however , was at last much altered for the better , by the gradual filling up of the vacant chambers on high , by scores of those miscellaneous , bread-and-cheese adventurers , and ambiguously professional nondescripts in very genteel but shabby black , and unaccountable foreign-looking fellows in blue spectacles ; who , previously issuing from unknown parts of the world , like storks in holland , light on the eaves , and in the attics of lofty old buildings in most large sea-port towns . here they sit and talk like magpies ; or descending in quest of improbable dinners , are to be seen drawn up along the curb in front of the eating-houses , like lean rows of broken-hearted pelicans on a beach ; their pockets loose , hanging down and flabby , like the pelican 's pouches when fish are hard to be caught . but these poor , penniless devils still strive to make ample amends for their physical forlornness , by resolutely reveling in the region of blissful ideals .
melville	pierre	they are mostly artists of various sorts ; painters , or sculptors , or indigent students , or teachers of languages , or poets , or fugitive french politicians , or german philosophers . their mental tendencies , however heterodox at times , are still very fine and spiritual upon the whole ; since the vacuity of their exchequers leads them to reject the coarse materialism of hobbs , and incline to the airy exaltations of the berkelyan philosophy . often groping in vain in their pockets , they can not but give in to the descartian vortices ; while the abundance of leisure in their attics ( physical and figurative ) , unite with the leisure in their stomachs , to fit them in an eminent degree for that undivided attention indispensable to the proper digesting of the sublimated categories of kant ; especially as kant ( ca n't ) is the one great palpable fact in their pervadingly impalpable lives . these are the glorious paupers , from whom i learn the profoundest mysteries of things ; since their very existence in the midst of such a terrible precariousness of the commonest means of support , affords a problem on which many speculative nutcrackers have been vainly employed . yet let me here offer up three locks of my hair , to the memory of all such glorious paupers who have lived and died in this world . surely , and truly i honor them -- noble men often at bottom -- and for that very reason i make bold to be gamesome about them ; for where fundamental nobleness is , and fundamental honor is due , merriment is never accounted irreverent . the fools and pretenders of humanity , and the impostors and baboons among the gods , these only are offended with raillery ; since both those gods and men whose titles to eminence are secure , seldom worry themselves about the seditious gossip of old apple-women , and the skylarkings of funny little boys in the street .
melville	pierre	when the substance is gone , men cling to the shadow . places once set apart to lofty purposes , still retain the name of that loftiness , even when converted to the meanest uses . it would seem , as if forced by imperative fate to renounce the reality of the romantic and lofty , the people of the present would fain make a compromise by retaining some purely imaginative remainder . the curious effects of this tendency is oftenest evinced in those venerable countries of the old transatlantic world ; where still over the thames one bridge yet retains the monastic tide of blackfriars ; though not a single black friar , but many a pickpocket , has stood on that bank since a good ways beyond the days of queen bess ; where still innumerable other historic anomalies sweetly and sadly remind the present man of the wonderful procession that preceded him in his new generation . nor -- though the comparative recentness of our own foundation upon these columbian shores , excludes any considerable participation in these attractive anomalies , -- yet are we not altogether , in our more elderly towns , wholly without some touch of them , here and there . it was thus with the ancient church of the apostles -- better known , even in its primitive day , under the abbreviative of the apostles -- which , though now converted from its original purpose to one so widely contrasting , yet still retained its majestical name . the lawyer or artist tenanting its chambers , whether in the new building or the old , when asked where he was to be found , invariably replied , -- _at the apostles ' _ . but because now , at last , in the course of the inevitable transplantations of the more notable localities of the various professions in a thriving and amplifying town , the venerable spot offered not such inducements as before to the legal gentlemen ; and as the strange nondescript adventurers and artists , and indigent philosophers of all sorts , crowded in as fast as the others left ; therefore , in reference to the metaphysical strangeness of these curious inhabitants , and owing in some sort to the circumstance , that several of them were well-known teleological theorists , and social reformers , and political propagandists of all manner of heterodoxical tenets ; therefore , i say , and partly , peradventure , from some slight waggishness in the public ; the immemorial popular name of the ancient church itself was participatingly transferred to the dwellers therein . so it came to pass , that in the general fashion of the day , he who had chambers in the old church was familiarly styled an _apostle_ .
melville	pierre	but as every effect is but the cause of another and a subsequent one , so it now happened that finding themselves thus clannishly , and not altogether infelicitously entitled , the occupants of the venerable church began to come together out of their various dens , in more social communion ; attracted toward each other by a title common to all . by-and-by , from this , they went further ; and insensibly , at last became organized in a peculiar society , which , though exceedingly inconspicuous , and hardly perceptible in its public demonstrations , was still secretly suspected to have some mysterious ulterior object , vaguely connected with the absolute overturning of church and state , and the hasty and premature advance of some unknown great political and religious millennium . still , though some zealous conservatives and devotees of morals , several times left warning at the police-office , to keep a wary eye on the old church ; and though , indeed , sometimes an officer would look up inquiringly at the suspicious narrow window-slits in the lofty tower ; yet , to say the truth , was the place , to all appearance , a very quiet and decorous one , and its occupants a company of harmless people , whose greatest reproach was efflorescent coats and crack-crowned hats all podding in the sun .
melville	pierre	though in the middle of the day many bales and boxes would be trundled along the stores in front of the apostles ' ; and along its critically narrow sidewalk , the merchants would now and then hurry to meet their checks ere the banks should close : yet the street , being mostly devoted to mere warehousing purposes , and not used as a general thoroughfare , it was at all times a rather secluded and silent place . but from an hour or two before sundown to ten or eleven o'clock the next morning , it was remarkably silent and depopulated , except by the apostles themselves ; while every sunday it presented an aspect of surprising and startling quiescence ; showing nothing but one long vista of six or seven stories of inexorable iron shutters on both sides of the way . it was pretty much the same with the other street , which , as before said , intersected with the warehousing lane , not very far from the apostles ' . for though that street was indeed a different one from the latter , being full of cheap refectories for clerks , foreign restaurants , and other places of commercial resort ; yet the only hum in it was restricted to business hours ; by night it was deserted of every occupant but the lamp-posts ; and on sunday , to walk through it , was like walking through an avenue of sphinxes .
melville	pierre	such , then , was the present condition of the ancient church of the apostles ; buzzing with a few lingering , equivocal lawyers in the basement , and populous with all sorts of poets , painters , paupers and philosophers above . a mysterious professor of the flute was perched in one of the upper stories of the tower ; and often , of silent , moonlight nights , his lofty , melodious notes would be warbled forth over the roofs of the ten thousand warehouses around him -- as of yore , the bell had pealed over the domestic gables of a long-departed generation .
melville	pierre	ii . on the third night following the arrival of the party in the city , pierre sat at twilight by a lofty window in the rear building of the apostles ' . the chamber was meager even to meanness . no carpet on the floor , no picture on the wall ; nothing but a low , long , and very curious-looking single bedstead , that might possibly serve for an indigent bachelor 's pallet , a large , blue , chintz-covered chest , a rickety , rheumatic , and most ancient mahogany chair , and a wide board of the toughest live-oak , about six feet long , laid upon two upright empty flour-barrels , and loaded with a large bottle of ink , an unfastened bundle of quills , a pen-knife , a folder , and a still unbound ream of foolscap paper , significantly stamped , `` ruled ; blue . ''
melville	pierre	there , on the third night , at twilight , sat pierre by that lofty window of a beggarly room in the rear-building of the apostles ' . he was entirely idle , apparently ; there was nothing in his hands ; but there might have been something on his heart . now and then he fixedly gazes at the curious-looking , rusty old bedstead . it seemed powerfully symbolical to him ; and most symbolical it was . for it was the ancient dismemberable and portable camp-bedstead of his grandfather , the defiant defender of the fort , the valiant captain in many an unsuccumbing campaign . on that very camp-bedstead , there , beneath his tent on the field , the glorious old mild-eyed and warrior-hearted general had slept , and but waked to buckle his knight-making sword by his side ; for it was noble knighthood to be slain by grand pierre ; in the other world his foes ' ghosts bragged of the hand that had given them their passports .
melville	pierre	but has that hard bed of war , descended for an inheritance to the soft body of peace ? in the peaceful time of full barns , and when the noise of the peaceful flail is abroad , and the hum of peaceful commerce resounds , is the grandson of two generals a warrior too ? oh , not for naught , in the time of this seeming peace , are warrior grandsires given to pierre ! for pierre is a warrior too ; life his campaign , and three fierce allies , woe and scorn and want , his foes . the wide world is banded against him ; for lo you ! he holds up the standard of right , and swears by the eternal and true ! but ah , pierre , pierre , when thou goest to that bed , how humbling the thought , that thy most extended length measures not the proud six feet four of thy grand john of gaunt sire ! the stature of the warrior is cut down to the dwindled glory of the fight . for more glorious in real tented field to strike down your valiant foe , than in the conflicts of a noble soul with a dastardly world to chase a vile enemy who ne'er will show front .
melville	pierre	there , then , on the third night , at twilight , by the lofty window of that beggarly room , sat pierre in the rear building of the apostles ' . he is gazing out from the window now . but except the donjon form of the old gray tower , seemingly there is nothing to see but a wilderness of tiles , slate , shingles , and tin ; -- the desolate hanging wildernesses of tiles , slate , shingles and tin , wherewith we modern babylonians replace the fair hanging-gardens of the fine old asiatic times when the excellent nebuchadnezzar was king .
melville	pierre	there he sits , a strange exotic , transplanted from the delectable alcoves of the old manorial mansion , to take root in this niggard soil . no more do the sweet purple airs of the hills round about the green fields of saddle meadows come revivingly wafted to his cheek . like a flower he feels the change ; his bloom is gone from his cheek ; his cheek is wilted and pale .
melville	pierre	from the lofty window of that beggarly room , what is it that pierre is so intently eying ? there is no street at his feet ; like a profound black gulf the open area of the quadrangle gapes beneath him . but across it , and at the further end of the steep roof of the ancient church , there looms the gray and grand old tower ; emblem to pierre of an unshakable fortitude , which , deep-rooted in the heart of the earth , defied all the howls of the air .
melville	pierre	there is a door in pierre 's room opposite the window of pierre : and now a soft knock is heard in that direction , accompanied by gentle words , asking whether the speaker might enter .
melville	pierre	`` yes , always , sweet isabel '' -- answered pierre , rising and approaching the door ; -- '' here : let us drag out the old camp-bed for a sofa ; come , sit down now , my sister , and let us fancy ourselves anywhere thou wilt . ''
melville	pierre	`` then , my brother , let us fancy ourselves in realms of everlasting twilight and peace , where no bright sun shall rise , because the black night is always its follower . twilight and peace , my brother , twilight and peace ! ''
melville	pierre	`` it is twilight now , my sister ; and surely , this part of the city at least seems still . '' `` twilight now , but night soon ; then a brief sun , and then another long night . peace now , but sleep and nothingness soon , and then hard work for thee , my brother , till the sweet twilight come again . ''
melville	pierre	`` let us light a candle , my sister ; the evening is deepening . '' `` for what light a candle , dear pierre ? -- sit close to me , my brother . '' he moved nearer to her , and stole one arm around her ; her sweet head leaned against his breast ; each felt the other 's throbbing .
melville	pierre	`` oh , my dear pierre , why should we always be longing for peace , and then be impatient of peace when it comes ? tell me , my brother ! not two hours ago , thou wert wishing for twilight , and now thou wantest a candle to hurry the twilight 's last lingering away . ''
melville	pierre	but pierre did not seem to hear her ; his arm embraced her tighter ; his whole frame was invisibly trembling . then suddenly in a low tone of wonderful intensity he breathed :
melville	pierre	`` isabel ! isabel ! '' she caught one arm around him , as his was around herself ; the tremor ran from him to her ; both sat dumb . he rose , and paced the room . `` well , pierre ; thou camest in here to arrange thy matters , thou saidst . now what hast thou done ? come , we will light a candle now . ''
melville	pierre	the candle was lighted , and their talk went on . `` how about the papers , my brother ? dost thou find every thing right ? hast thou decided upon what to publish first , while thou art writing the new thing thou didst hint of ? ''
melville	pierre	`` look at that chest , my sister . seest thou not that the cords are yet untied ? '' `` then thou hast not been into it at all as yet ? '' `` not at all , isabel . in ten days i have lived ten thousand years . forewarned now of the rubbish in that chest , i can not summon the heart to open it . trash ! dross ! dirt ! ''
melville	pierre	`` pierre ! pierre ! what change is this ? didst thou not tell me , ere we came hither , that thy chest not only contained some silver and gold , but likewise far more precious things , readily convertible into silver and gold ? ah , pierre , thou didst swear we had naught to fear ! ''
melville	pierre	`` if i have ever willfully deceived thee , isabel , may the high gods prove benedict arnolds to me , and go over to the devils to reinforce them against me ! but to have ignorantly deceived myself and thee together , isabel ; that is a very different thing . oh , what a vile juggler and cheat is man ! isabel , in that chest are things which in the hour of composition , i thought the very heavens looked in from the windows in astonishment at their beauty and power . then , afterward , when days cooled me down , and again i took them up and scanned them , some underlying suspicions intruded ; but when in the open air , i recalled the fresh , unwritten images of the bunglingly written things ; then i felt buoyant and triumphant again ; as if by that act of ideal recalling , i had , forsooth , transferred the perfect ideal to the miserable written attempt at embodying it . this mood remained . so that afterward how i talked to thee about the wonderful things i had done ; the gold and the silver mine i had long before sprung for thee and for me , who never were to come to want in body or mind . yet all this time , there was the latent suspicion of folly ; but i would not admit it ; i shut my soul 's door in its face . yet now , the ten thousand universal revealings brand me on the forehead with fool ! and like protested notes at the bankers , all those written things of mine , are jaggingly cut through and through with the protesting hammer of truth ! -- oh , i am sick , sick , sick ! ''
melville	pierre	`` let the arms that never were filled but by thee , lure thee back again , pierre , to the peace of the twilight , even though it be of the dimmest ! '' she blew out the light , and made pierre sit down by her ; and their hands were placed in each other 's .
melville	pierre	`` say , are not thy torments now gone , my brother ? '' `` but replaced by -- by -- by -- oh god , isabel , unhand me ! '' cried pierre , starting up . `` ye heavens , that have hidden yourselves in the black hood of the night , i call to ye ! if to follow virtue to her uttermost vista , where common souls never go ; if by that i take hold on hell , and the uttermost virtue , after all , prove but a betraying pander to the monstrousest vice , -- then close in and crush me , ye stony walls , and into one gulf let all things tumble together ! ''
melville	pierre	`` my brother ! this is some incomprehensible raving , '' pealed isabel , throwing both arms around him ; -- '' my brother , my brother ! '' `` hark thee to thy furthest inland soul '' -- thrilled pierre in a steeled and quivering voice . `` call me brother no more ! how knowest thou i am thy brother ? did thy mother tell thee ? did my father say so to me ? -- i am pierre , and thou isabel , wide brother and sister in the common humanity , -- no more . for the rest , let the gods look after their own combustibles . if they have put powder-casks in me -- let them look to it ! let them look to it ! ah ! now i catch glimpses , and seem to half-see , somehow , that the uttermost ideal of moral perfection in man is wide of the mark . the demigods trample on trash , and virtue and vice are trash ! isabel , i will write such things -- i will gospelize the world anew , and show them deeper secrets than the apocalypse ! -- i will write it , i will write it ! ''
melville	pierre	`` pierre , i am a poor girl , born in the midst of a mystery , bred in mystery , and still surviving to mystery . so mysterious myself , the air and the earth are unutterable to me ; no word have i to express them . but these are the circumambient mysteries ; thy words , thy thoughts , open other wonder-worlds to me , whither by myself i might fear to go . but trust to me , pierre . with thee , with thee , i would boldly swim a starless sea , and be buoy to thee , there , when thou the strong swimmer shouldst faint . thou , pierre , speakest of virtue and vice ; life-secluded isabel knows neither the one nor the other , but by hearsay . what are they , in their real selves , pierre ? tell me first what is virtue : -- begin ! ''
melville	pierre	`` if on that point the gods are dumb , shall a pigmy speak ? ask the air ! '' `` then virtue is nothing . '' `` not that ! '' `` then vice ? '' `` look : a nothing is the substance , it casts one shadow one way , and another the other way ; and these two shadows cast from one nothing ; these , seems to me , are virtue and vice . ''
melville	pierre	`` then why torment thyself so , dearest pierre ? '' `` it is the law . '' `` what ? '' `` that a nothing should torment a nothing ; for i am a nothing . it is all a dream -- we dream that we dreamed we dream . ''
melville	pierre	`` pierre , when thou just hovered on the verge , thou wert a riddle to me ; but now , that thou art deep down in the gulf of the soul , -- now , when thou wouldst be lunatic to wise men , perhaps -- now doth poor ignorant isabel begin to comprehend thee . thy feeling hath long been mine , pierre . long loneliness and anguish have opened miracles to me . yes , it is all a dream ! ''
melville	pierre	swiftly he caught her in his arms : -- '' from nothing proceeds nothing , isabel ! how can one sin in a dream ? '' `` first what is sin , pierre ? '' `` another name for the other name , isabel . ''
melville	pierre	`` for virtue , pierre ? '' `` no , for vice . '' `` let us sit down again , my brother . '' `` i am pierre . '' `` let us sit down again , pierre ; sit close ; thy arm ! '' and so , on the third night , when the twilight was gone , and no lamp was lit , within the lofty window of that beggarly room , sat pierre and isabel hushed .
melville	pierre	book xx . charlie millthorpe . i. pierre had been induced to take chambers at the apostles ' , by one of the apostles themselves , an old acquaintance of his , and a native of saddle meadows .
melville	pierre	millthorpe was the son of a very respectable farmer -- now dead -- of more than common intelligence , and whose bowed shoulders and homely garb had still been surmounted by a head fit for a greek philosopher , and features so fine and regular that they would have well graced an opulent gentleman . the political and social levelings and confoundings of all manner of human elements in america , produce many striking individual anomalies unknown in other lands . pierre well remembered old farmer millthorpe : -- the handsome , melancholy , calm-tempered , mute , old man ; in whose countenance -- refinedly ennobled by nature , and yet coarsely tanned and attenuated by many a prolonged day 's work in the harvest -- rusticity and classicalness were strangely united . the delicate profile of his face , bespoke the loftiest aristocracy ; his knobbed and bony hands resembled a beggar 's .
melville	pierre	though for several generations the millthorpes had lived on the glendinning lands , they loosely and unostentatiously traced their origin to an emigrating english knight , who had crossed the sea in the time of the elder charles . but that indigence which had prompted the knight to forsake his courtly country for the howling wilderness , was the only remaining hereditament left to his bedwindled descendants in the fourth and fifth remove . at the time that pierre first recollected this interesting man , he had , a year or two previous , abandoned an ample farm on account of absolute inability to meet the manorial rent , and was become the occupant of a very poor and contracted little place , on which was a small and half-ruinous house . there , he then harbored with his wife , -- a very gentle and retiring person , -- his three little daughters , and his only son , a lad of pierre 's own age . the hereditary beauty and youthful bloom of this boy ; his sweetness of temper , and something of natural refinement as contrasted with the unrelieved rudeness , and oftentimes sordidness , of his neighbors ; these things had early attracted the sympathetic , spontaneous friendliness of pierre . they were often wont to take their boyish rambles together ; and even the severely critical mrs. glendinning , always fastidiously cautious as to the companions of pierre , had never objected to his intimacy with so prepossessing and handsome a rustic as charles .
melville	pierre	boys are often very swiftly acute in forming a judgment on character . the lads had not long companioned , ere pierre concluded , that however fine his face , and sweet his temper , young millthorpe was but little vigorous in mind ; besides possessing a certain constitutional , sophomorean presumption and egotism ; which , however , having nothing to feed on but his father 's meal and potatoes , and his own essentially timid and humane disposition , merely presented an amusing and harmless , though incurable , anomalous feature in his character , not at all impairing the good-will and companionableness of pierre ; for even in his boyhood , pierre possessed a sterling charity , which could cheerfully overlook all minor blemishes in his inferiors , whether in fortune or mind ; content and glad to embrace the good whenever presented , or with whatever conjoined . so , in youth , do we unconsciously act upon those peculiar principles , which in conscious and verbalized maxims shall systematically regulate our maturer lives ; -- a fact , which forcibly illustrates the necessitarian dependence of our lives , and their subordination , not to ourselves , but to fate .
melville	pierre	if the grown man of taste , possess not only some eye to detect the picturesque in the natural landscape , so also , has he as keen a perception of what may not unfitly be here styled , the _povertiresque_ in the social landscape . to such an one , not more picturesquely conspicuous is the dismantled thatch in a painted cottage of gainsborough , than the time-tangled and want-thinned locks of a beggar , _povertiresquely_ diversifying those snug little cabinet-pictures of the world , which , exquisitely varnished and framed , are hung up in the drawing-room minds of humane men of taste , and amiable philosophers of either the `` compensation , '' or `` optimist '' school . they deny that any misery is in the world , except for the purpose of throwing the fine _povertiresque_ element into its general picture . go to ! god hath deposited cash in the bank subject to our gentlemanly order ; he hath bounteously blessed the world with a summer carpet of green . begone , heraclitus ! the lamentations of the rain are but to make us our rainbows !
melville	pierre	not that in equivocal reference to the _povertiresque_ old farmer millthorpe , pierre is here intended to be hinted at . still , man can not wholly escape his surroundings . unconsciously mrs. glendinning had always been one of these curious optimists ; and in his boyish life pierre had not wholly escaped the maternal contagion . yet often , in calling at the old farmer 's for charles of some early winter mornings , and meeting the painfully embarrassed , thin , feeble features of mrs. millthorpe , and the sadly inquisitive and hopelessly half-envious glances of the three little girls ; and standing on the threshold , pierre would catch low , aged , life-weary groans from a recess out of sight from the door ; then would pierre have some boyish inklings of something else than the pure _povertiresque_ in poverty : some inklings of what it might be , to be old , and poor , and worn , and rheumatic , with shivering death drawing nigh , and present life itself but a dull and a chill ! some inklings of what it might be , for him who in youth had vivaciously leaped from his bed , impatient to meet the earliest sun , and lose no sweet drop of his life , now hating the beams he once so dearly loved ; turning round in his bed to the wall to avoid them ; and still postponing the foot which should bring him back to the dismal day ; when the sun is not gold , but copper ; and the sky is not blue , but gray ; and the blood , like rhenish wine , too long unquaffed by death , grows thin and sour in the veins .
melville	pierre	pierre had not forgotten that the augmented penury of the millthorpe 's was , at the time we now retrospectively treat of , gravely imputed by the gossiping frequenters of the black swan inn , to certain insinuated moral derelictions of the farmer . `` the old man tipped his elbow too often , '' once said in pierre 's hearing an old bottle-necked fellow , performing the identical same act with a half-emptied glass in his hand . but though the form of old millthorpe was broken , his countenance , however sad and thin , betrayed no slightest sign of the sot , either past or present . he never was publicly known to frequent the inn , and seldom quitted the few acres he cultivated with his son . and though , alas , indigent enough , yet was he most punctually honest in paying his little debts of shillings and pence for his groceries . and though , heaven knows , he had plenty of occasion for all the money he could possibly earn , yet pierre remembered , that when , one autumn , a hog was bought of him for the servants ' hall at the mansion , the old man never called for his money till the midwinter following ; and then , as with trembling fingers he eagerly clutched the silver , he unsteadily said , `` i have no use for it now ; it might just as well have stood over . '' it was then , that chancing to overhear this , mrs. glendinning had looked at the old man , with a kindly and benignantly interested eye to the _povertiresque_ ; and murmured , `` ah ! the old english knight is not yet out of his blood . bravo , old man ! ''
melville	pierre	one day , in pierre 's sight , nine silent figures emerged from the door of old millthorpe ; a coffin was put into a neighbor 's farm-wagon ; and a procession , some thirty feet long , including the elongated pole and box of the wagon , wound along saddle meadows to a hill , where , at last , old millthorpe was laid down in a bed , where the rising sun should affront him no more . oh , softest and daintiest of holland linen is the motherly earth ! there , beneath the sublime tester of the infinite sky , like emperors and kings , sleep , in grand state , the beggars and paupers of earth ! i joy that death is this democrat ; and hopeless of all other real and permanent democracies , still hug the thought , that though in life some heads are crowned with gold , and some bound round with thorns , yet chisel them how they will , head-stones are all alike .
melville	pierre	this somewhat particular account of the father of young millthorpe , will better set forth the less immature condition and character of the son , on whom had now descended the maintenance of his mother and sisters . but , though the son of a farmer , charles was peculiarly averse to hard labor . it was not impossible that by resolute hard labor he might eventually have succeeded in placing his family in a far more comfortable situation than he had ever remembered them . but it was not so fated ; the benevolent state had in its great wisdom decreed otherwise .
melville	pierre	in the village of saddle meadows there was an institution , half common-school and half academy , but mainly supported by a general ordinance and financial provision of the government here , not only were the rudiments of an english education taught , but likewise some touch of belles lettres , and composition , and that great american bulwark and bore -- elocution . on the high-raised , stage platform of the saddle meadows academy , the sons of the most indigent day-laborers were wont to drawl out the fiery revolutionary rhetoric of patrick henry , or gesticulate impetuously through the soft cadences of drake 's `` culprit fay . '' what wonder , then , that of saturdays , when there was no elocution and poesy , these boys should grow melancholy and disdainful over the heavy , plodding handles of dung-forks and hoes ?
melville	pierre	at the age of fifteen , the ambition of charles millthorpe was to be either an orator , or a poet ; at any rate , a great genius of one sort or other . he recalled the ancestral knight , and indignantly spurned the plow . detecting in him the first germ of this inclination , old millthorpe had very seriously reasoned with his son ; warning him against the evils of his vagrant ambition . ambition of that sort was either for undoubted genius , rich boys , or poor boys , standing entirely alone in the world , with no one relying upon them . charles had better consider the case ; his father was old and infirm ; he could not last very long ; he had nothing to leave behind him but his plow and his hoe ; his mother was sickly ; his sisters pale and delicate ; and finally , life was a fact , and the winters in that part of the country exceedingly bitter and long . seven months out of the twelve the pastures bore nothing , and all cattle must be fed in the barns . but charles was a boy ; advice often seems the most wantonly wasted of all human breath ; man will not take wisdom on trust ; may be , it is well ; for such wisdom is worthless ; we must find the true gem for ourselves ; and so we go groping and groping for many and many a day .
melville	pierre	yet was charles millthorpe as affectionate and dutiful a boy as ever boasted of his brain , and knew not that he possessed a far more excellent and angelical thing in the possession of a generous heart . his father died ; to his family he resolved to be a second father , and a careful provider now . but not by hard toil of his hand ; but by gentler practices of his mind . already he had read many books -- history , poetry , romance , essays , and all . the manorial book-shelves had often been honored by his visits , and pierre had kindly been his librarian . not to lengthen the tale , at the age of seventeen , charles sold the horse , the cow , the pig , the plow , the hoe , and almost every movable thing on the premises ; and , converting all into cash , departed with his mother and sisters for the city ; chiefly basing his expectations of success on some vague representations of an apothecary relative there resident . how he and his mother and sisters battled it out ; how they pined and half-starved for a while ; how they took in sewing ; and charles took in copying ; and all but scantily sufficed for a livelihood ; all this may be easily imagined . but some mysterious latent good-will of fate toward him , had not only thus far kept charles from the poor-house , but had really advanced his fortunes in a degree . at any rate , that certain harmless presumption and innocent egotism which have been previously adverted to as sharing in his general character , these had by no means retarded him ; for it is often to be observed of the shallower men , that they are the very last to despond . it is the glory of the bladder that nothing can sink it ; it is the reproach of a box of treasure , that once overboard it must down .
melville	pierre	ii . when arrived in the city , and discovering the heartless neglect of glen , pierre , -- looking about him for whom to apply to in this strait , -- bethought him of his old boy-companion charlie , and went out to seek him , and found him at last ; he saw before him , a tall , well-grown , but rather thin and pale yet strikingly handsome young man of two-and-twenty ; occupying a small dusty law-office on the third floor of the older building of the apostles ; assuming to be doing a very large , and hourly increasing business among empty pigeon-holes , and directly under the eye of an unopened bottle of ink ; his mother and sisters dwelling in a chamber overhead ; and himself , not only following the law for a corporeal living , but likewise inter-linked with the peculiar secret , theologico-politico-social schemes of the masonic order of the seedy-coated apostles ; and pursuing some crude , transcendental philosophy , for both a contributory means of support , as well as for his complete intellectual aliment .
melville	pierre	pierre was at first somewhat startled by his exceedingly frank and familiar manner ; all old manorial deference for pierre was clean gone and departed ; though at the first shock of their encounter , charlie could not possibly have known that pierre was cast off .
melville	pierre	`` ha , pierre ! glad to see you , my boy ! hark ye , next month i am to deliver an address before the omega order of the apostles . the grand master , plinlimmon , will be there . i have heard on the best authority that he once said of me -- 'that youth has the primitive categories in him ; he is destined to astonish the world . ' why , lad , i have received propositions from the editors of the spinozaist to contribute a weekly column to their paper , and you know how very few can understand the spinozaist ; nothing is admitted there but the ultimate transcendentals . hark now , in your ear ; i think of throwing off the apostolic disguise and coming boldly out ; pierre ! i think of stumping the state , and preaching our philosophy to the masses. -- when did you arrive in town ? ''
melville	pierre	spite of all his tribulations , pierre could not restrain a smile at this highly diverting reception ; but well knowing the youth , he did not conclude from this audacious burst of enthusiastic egotism that his heart had at all corroded ; for egotism is one thing , and selfishness another . no sooner did pierre intimate his condition to him , than immediately , charlie was all earnest and practical kindness ; recommended the apostles as the best possible lodgment for him , -- cheap , snug , and convenient to most public places ; he offered to procure a cart and see himself to the transport of pierre 's luggage ; but finally thought it best to mount the stairs and show him the vacant rooms . but when these at last were decided upon ; and charlie , all cheerfulness and alacrity , started with pierre for the hotel , to assist him in the removal ; grasping his arm the moment they emerged from the great arched door under the tower of the apostles ; he instantly launched into his amusing heroics , and continued the strain till the trunks were fairly in sight .
melville	pierre	`` lord ! my law-business overwhelms me ! i must drive away some of my clients ; i must have my exercise , and this ever-growing business denies it to me . besides , i owe something to the sublime cause of the general humanity ; i must displace some of my briefs for my metaphysical treatises . i can not waste all my oil over bonds and mortgages. -- you said you were married , i think ? ''
melville	pierre	but without stopping for any reply , he rattled on . `` well , i suppose it is wise after all . it settles , centralizes , and confirms a man , i have heard. -- no , i did n't ; it is a random thought of my own , that ! -- yes , it makes the world definite to him ; it removes his morbid _sub_jectiveness , and makes all things _ob_jective ; nine small children , for instance , may be considered _ob_jective . marriage , hey ! -- a fine thing , no doubt , no doubt : -- domestic -- pretty -- nice , all round . but i owe something to the world , my boy ! by marriage , i might contribute to the population of men , but not to the census of mind . the great men are all bachelors , you know . their family is the universe : i should say the planet saturn was their elder son ; and plato their uncle. -- so you are married ? ''
melville	pierre	but again , reckless of answers , charlie went on . `` pierre , a thought , my boy ; -- a thought for you ! you do not say it , but you hint of a low purse . now i shall help you to fill it -- stump the state on the kantian philosophy ! a dollar a head , my boy ! pass round your beaver , and you 'll get it . i have every confidence in the penetration and magnanimousness of the people ! pierre , hark in your ear ; -- it 's my opinion the world is all wrong . hist , i say -- an entire mistake . society demands an avatar , -- a curtius , my boy ! to leap into the fiery gulf , and by perishing himself , save the whole empire of men ! pierre , i have long renounced the allurements of life and fashion . look at my coat , and see how i spurn them ! pierre ! but , stop , have you ever a shilling ! let 's take a cold cut here -- it 's a cheap place ; i go here sometimes . come , let 's in . ''
melville	pierre	book xxi . pierre immaturely attempts a mature work . tidings from the meadows . plinlimmon . i . we are now to behold pierre permanently lodged in three lofty adjoining chambers of the apostles . and passing on a little further in time , and overlooking the hundred and one domestic details , of how their internal arrangements were finally put into steady working order ; how poor delly , now giving over the sharper pangs of her grief , found in the lighter occupations of a handmaid and familiar companion to isabel , the only practical relief from the memories of her miserable past ; how isabel herself in the otherwise occupied hours of pierre , passed some of her time in mastering the chirographical incoherencies of his manuscripts , with a view to eventually copying them out in a legible hand for the printer ; or went below stairs to the rooms of the millthorpes , and in the modest and amiable society of the three young ladies and their excellent mother , found some little solace for the absence of pierre ; or , when his day 's work was done , sat by him in the twilight , and played her mystic guitar till pierre felt chapter after chapter born of its wondrous suggestiveness ; but alas ! eternally incapable of being translated into words ; for where the deepest words end , there music begins with its supersensuous and all-confounding intimations .
melville	pierre	disowning now all previous exertions of his mind , and burning in scorn even those fine fruits of a care-free fancy , which , written at saddle meadows in the sweet legendary time of lucy and her love , he had jealously kept from the publishers , as too true and good to be published ; renouncing all his foregone self , pierre was now engaged in a comprehensive compacted work , to whose speedy completion two tremendous motives unitedly impelled ; -- the burning desire to deliver what he thought to be new , or at least miserably neglected truth to the world ; and the prospective menace of being absolutely penniless , unless by the sale of his book , he could realize money . swayed to universality of thought by the widely-explosive mental tendencies of the profound events which had lately befallen him , and the unprecedented situation in which he now found himself ; and perceiving , by presentiment , that most grand productions of the best human intellects ever are built round a circle , as atolls ( _i . e._ the primitive coral islets which , raising themselves in the depths of profoundest seas , rise funnel-like to the surface , and present there a hoop of white rock , which though on the outside everywhere lashed by the ocean , yet excludes all tempests from the quiet lagoon within ) , digestively including the whole range of all that can be known or dreamed ; pierre was resolved to give the world a book , which the world should hail with surprise and delight . a varied scope of reading , little suspected by his friends , and randomly acquired by a random but lynx-eyed mind , in the course of the multifarious , incidental , bibliographic encounterings of almost any civilized young inquirer after truth ; this poured one considerable contributary stream into that bottomless spring of original thought which the occasion and time had caused to burst out in himself . now he congratulated himself upon all his cursory acquisitions of this sort ; ignorant that in reality to a mind bent on producing some thoughtful thing of absolute truth , all mere reading is apt to prove but an obstacle hard to overcome ; and not an accelerator helpingly pushing him along .
melville	pierre	while pierre was thinking that he was entirely transplanted into a new and wonderful element of beauty and power , he was , in fact , but in one of the stages of the transition . that ultimate element once fairly gained , then books no more are needed for buoys to our souls ; our own strong limbs support us , and we float over all bottomlessnesses with a jeering impunity . he did not see , -- or if he did , he could not yet name the true cause for it , -- that already , in the incipiency of his work , the heavy unmalleable element of mere book-knowledge would not congenially weld with the wide fluidness and ethereal airiness of spontaneous creative thought . he would climb parnassus with a pile of folios on his back . he did not see , that it was nothing at all to him , what other men had written ; that though plato was indeed a transcendently great man in himself , yet plato must not be transcendently great to him ( pierre ) , so long as he ( pierre himself ) would also do something transcendently great . he did not see that there is no such thing as a standard for the creative spirit ; that no one great book must ever be separately regarded , and permitted to domineer with its own uniqueness upon the creative mind ; but that all existing great works must be federated in the fancy ; and so regarded as a miscellaneous and pantheistic whole ; and then , -- without at all dictating to his own mind , or unduly biasing it any way , -- thus combined , they would prove simply an exhilarative and provocative to him . he did not see , that even when thus combined , all was but one small mite , compared to the latent infiniteness and inexhaustibility in himself ; that all the great books in the world are but the mutilated shadowings-forth of invisible and eternally unembodied images in the soul ; so that they are but the mirrors , distortedly reflecting to us our own things ; and never mind what the mirror may be , if we would see the object , we must look at the object itself , and not at its reflection .
melville	pierre	but , as to the resolute traveler in switzerland , the alps do never in one wide and comprehensive sweep , instantaneously reveal their full awfulness of amplitude -- their overawing extent of peak crowded on peak , and spur sloping on spur , and chain jammed behind chain , and all their wonderful battalionings of might ; so hath heaven wisely ordained , that on first entering into the switzerland of his soul , man shall not at once perceive its tremendous immensity ; lest illy prepared for such an encounter , his spirit should sink and perish in the lowermost snows . only by judicious degrees , appointed of god , does man come at last to gain his mont blanc and take an overtopping view of these alps ; and even then , the tithe is not shown ; and far over the invisible atlantic , the rocky mountains and the andes are yet unbeheld . appalling is the soul of a man ! better might one be pushed off into the material spaces beyond the uttermost orbit of our sun , than once feel himself fairly afloat in himself !
melville	pierre	but not now to consider these ulterior things , pierre , though strangely and very newly alive to many before unregarded wonders in the general world ; still , had he not as yet procured for himself that enchanter 's wand of the soul , which but touching the humblest experiences in one 's life , straightway it starts up all eyes , in every one of which are endless significancies . not yet had he dropped his angle into the well of his childhood , to find what fish might be there ; for who dreams to find fish in a well ? the running stream of the outer world , there doubtless swim the golden perch and the pickerel ! ten million things were as yet uncovered to pierre . the old mummy lies buried in cloth on cloth ; it takes time to unwrap this egyptian king . yet now , forsooth , because pierre began to see through the first superficiality of the world , he fondly weens he has come to the unlayered substance . but , far as any geologist has yet gone down into the world , it is found to consist of nothing but surface stratified on surface . to its axis , the world being nothing but superinduced superficies . by vast pains we mine into the pyramid ; by horrible gropings we come to the central room ; with joy we espy the sarcophagus ; but we lift the lid -- and no body is there ! -- appallingly vacant as vast is the soul of a man !
melville	pierre	ii . he had been engaged some weeks upon his book -- in pursuance of his settled plan avoiding all contact with any of his city-connections or friends , even as in his social downfall they sedulously avoided seeking him out -- nor ever once going or sending to the post-office , though it was but a little round the corner from where he was , since having dispatched no letters himself , he expected none ; thus isolated from the world , and intent upon his literary enterprise , pierre had passed some weeks , when verbal tidings came to him , of three most momentous events .
melville	pierre	first : his mother was dead . second : all saddle meadows was become glen stanly 's . third : glen stanly was believed to be the suitor of lucy ; who , convalescent from an almost mortal illness , was now dwelling at her mother 's house in town .
melville	pierre	it was chiefly the first-mentioned of these events which darted a sharp natural anguish into pierre . no letter had come to him ; no smallest ring or memorial been sent him ; no slightest mention made of him in the will ; and yet it was reported that an inconsolable grief had induced his mother 's mortal malady , and driven her at length into insanity , which suddenly terminated in death ; and when he first heard of that event , she had been cold in the ground for twenty-five days .
melville	pierre	how plainly did all this speak of the equally immense pride and grief of his once magnificent mother ; and how agonizedly now did it hint of her mortally-wounded love for her only and best-beloved pierre ! in vain he reasoned with himself ; in vain remonstrated with himself ; in vain sought to parade all his stoic arguments to drive off the onslaught of natural passion . nature prevailed ; and with tears that like acid burned and scorched as they flowed , he wept , he raved , at the bitter loss of his parent ; whose eyes had been closed by unrelated hands that were hired ; but whose heart had been broken , and whose very reason been ruined , by the related hands of her son .
melville	pierre	for some interval it almost seemed as if his own heart would snap ; his own reason go down . unendurable grief of a man , when death itself gives the stab , and then snatches all availments to solacement away . for in the grave is no help , no prayer thither may go , no forgiveness thence come ; so that the penitent whose sad victim lies in the ground , for that useless penitent his doom is eternal , and though it be christmas-day with all christendom , with him it is hell-day and an eaten liver forever .
melville	pierre	with what marvelous precision and exactitude he now went over in his mind all the minutest details of his old joyous life with his mother at saddle meadows . he began with his own toilet in the morning ; then his mild stroll into the fields ; then his cheerful return to call his mother in her chamber ; then the gay breakfast -- and so on , and on , all through the sweet day , till mother and son kissed , and with light , loving hearts separated to their beds , to prepare themselves for still another day of affectionate delight . this recalling of innocence and joy in the hour of remorsefulness and woe ; this is as heating red-hot the pincers that tear us . but in this delirium of his soul , pierre could not define where that line was , which separated the natural grief for the loss of a parent from that other one which was born of compunction . he strove hard to define it , but could not . he tried to cozen himself into believing that all his grief was but natural , or if there existed any other , that must spring -- not from the consciousness of having done any possible wrong -- but from the pang at what terrible cost the more exalted virtues are gained . nor did he wholly fail in this endeavor . at last he dismissed his mother 's memory into that same profound vault where hitherto had reposed the swooned form of his lucy . but , as sometimes men are coffined in a trance , being thereby mistaken for dead ; so it is possible to bury a tranced grief in the soul , erroneously supposing that it hath no more vitality of suffering . now , immortal things only can beget immortality . it would almost seem one presumptive argument for the endless duration of the human soul , that it is impossible in time and space to kill any compunction arising from having cruelly injured a departed fellow-being .
melville	pierre	ere he finally committed his mother to the profoundest vault of his soul , fain would he have drawn one poor alleviation from a circumstance , which nevertheless , impartially viewed , seemed equally capable either of soothing or intensifying his grief . his mother 's will , which without the least mention of his own name , bequeathed several legacies to her friends , and concluded by leaving all saddle meadows and its rent-rolls to glendinning stanly ; this will bore the date of the day immediately succeeding his fatal announcement on the landing of the stairs , of his assumed nuptials with isabel . it plausibly pressed upon him , that as all the evidences of his mother 's dying unrelentingness toward him were negative ; and the only positive evidence -- so to speak -- of even that negativeness , was the will which omitted all mention of pierre ; therefore , as that will bore so significant a date , it must needs be most reasonable to conclude , that it was dictated in the not yet subsided transports of his mother 's first indignation . but small consolation was this , when he considered the final insanity of his mother ; for whence that insanity but from a hate-grief unrelenting , even as his father must have become insane from a sin-grief irreparable ? nor did this remarkable double-doom of his parents wholly fail to impress his mind with presentiments concerning his own fate -- his own hereditary liability to madness . presentiment , i say ; but what is a presentiment ? how shall you coherently define a presentiment , or how make any thing out of it which is at all lucid , unless you say that a presentiment is but a judgment in disguise ? and if a judgment in disguise , and yet possessing this preternaturalness of prophecy , how then shall you escape the fateful conclusion , that you are helplessly held in the six hands of the sisters ? for while still dreading your doom , you foreknow it . yet how foreknow and dread in one breath , unless with this divine seeming power of prescience , you blend the actual slimy powerlessness of defense ?
melville	pierre	that his cousin , glen stanly , had been chosen by his mother to inherit the domain of the meadows , was not entirely surprising to pierre . not only had glen always been a favorite with his mother by reason of his superb person and his congeniality of worldly views with herself , but excepting only pierre , he was her nearest surviving blood relation ; and moreover , in his christian name , bore the hereditary syllables , glendinning . so that if to any one but pierre the meadows must descend , glen , on these general grounds , seemed the appropriate heir .
melville	pierre	but it is not natural for a man , never mind who he may be , to see a noble patrimony , rightfully his , go over to a soul-alien , and that alien once his rival in love , and now his heartless , sneering foe ; for so pierre could not but now argue of glen ; it is not natural for a man to see this without singular emotions of discomfort and hate . nor in pierre were these feelings at all soothed by the report of glen 's renewed attentions to lucy . for there is something in the breast of almost every man , which at bottom takes offense at the attentions of any other man offered to a woman , the hope of whose nuptial love he himself may have discarded . fain would a man selfishly appropriate all the hearts which have ever in any way confessed themselves his . besides , in pierre 's case , this resentment was heightened by glen 's previous hypocritical demeanor . for now all his suspicions seemed abundantly verified ; and comparing all dates , he inferred that glen 's visit to europe had only been undertaken to wear off the pang of his rejection by lucy , a rejection tacitly consequent upon her not denying her affianced relation to pierre .
melville	pierre	but now , under the mask of profound sympathy -- in time , ripening into love -- for a most beautiful girl , ruffianly deserted by her betrothed , glen could afford to be entirely open in his new suit , without at all exposing his old scar to the world . so at least it now seemed to pierre . moreover , glen could now approach lucy under the most favorable possible auspices . he could approach her as a deeply sympathizing friend , all wishful to assuage her sorrow , but hinting nothing , at present , of any selfish matrimonial intent ; by enacting this prudent and unclamorous part , the mere sight of such tranquil , disinterested , but indestructible devotedness , could not but suggest in lucy 's mind , very natural comparisons between glen and pierre , most deplorably abasing to the latter . then , no woman -- as it would sometimes seem -- no woman is utterly free from the influence of a princely social position in her suitor , especially if he be handsome and young . and glen would come to her now the master of two immense fortunes , and the heir , by voluntary election , no less than by blood propinquity , to the ancestral bannered hall , and the broad manorial meadows of the glendinnings . and thus , too , the spirit of pierre 's own mother would seem to press glen 's suit . indeed , situated now as he was glen would seem all the finest part of pierre , without any of pierre 's shame ; would almost seem pierre himself -- what pierre had once been to lucy . and as in the case of a man who has lost a sweet wife , and who long refuses the least consolation ; as this man at last finds a singular solace in the companionship of his wife 's sister , who happens to bear a peculiar family resemblance to the dead ; and as he , in the end , proposes marriage to this sister , merely from the force of such magical associative influences ; so it did not seem wholly out of reason to suppose , that the great manly beauty of glen , possessing a strong related similitude to pierre 's , might raise in lucy 's heart associations , which would lead her at least to seek -- if she could not find -- solace for one now regarded as dead and gone to her forever , in the devotedness of another , who would notwithstanding almost seem as that dead one brought back to life .
melville	pierre	deep , deep , and still deep and deeper must we go , if we would find out the heart of a man ; descending into which is as descending a spiral stair in a shaft , without any end , and where that endlessness is only concealed by the spiralness of the stair , and the blackness of the shaft .
melville	pierre	as pierre conjured up this phantom of glen transformed into the seeming semblance of himself ; as he figured it advancing toward lucy and raising her hand in devotion ; an infinite quenchless rage and malice possessed him . many commingled emotions combined to provoke this storm . but chief of all was something strangely akin to that indefinable detestation which one feels for any impostor who has dared to assume one 's own name and aspect in any equivocal or dishonorable affair ; an emotion greatly intensified if this impostor be known for a mean villain at bottom , and also , by the freak of nature to be almost the personal duplicate of the man whose identity he assumes . all these and a host of other distressful and resentful fancies now ran through the breast of pierre . all his faith-born , enthusiastic , high-wrought , stoic , and philosophic defenses , were now beaten down by this sudden storm of nature in his soul . for there is no faith , and no stoicism , and no philosophy , that a mortal man can possibly evoke , which will stand the final test of a real impassioned onset of life and passion upon him . then all the fair philosophic or faith-phantoms that he raised from the mist , slide away and disappear as ghosts at cock-crow . for faith and philosophy are air , but events are brass . amidst his gray philosophizings , life breaks upon a man like a morning .
melville	pierre	while this mood was on him , pierre cursed himself for a heartless villain and an idiot fool ; -- heartless villain , as the murderer of his mother -- idiot fool , because he had thrown away all his felicity ; because he had himself , as it were , resigned his noble birthright to a cunning kinsman for a mess of pottage , which now proved all but ashes in his mouth .
melville	pierre	resolved to hide these new , and -- as it latently seemed to him -- unworthy pangs , from isabel , as also their cause , he quitted his chamber , intending a long vagabond stroll in the suburbs of the town , to wear off his sharper grief , ere he should again return into her sight .
melville	pierre	iii . as pierre , now hurrying from his chamber , was rapidly passing through one of the higher brick colonnades connecting the ancient building with the modern , there advanced toward him from the direction of the latter , a very plain , composed , manly figure , with a countenance rather pale if any thing , but quite clear and without wrinkle . though the brow and the beard , and the steadiness of the head and settledness of the step indicated mature age , yet the blue , bright , but still quiescent eye offered a very striking contrast . in that eye , the gay immortal youth apollo , seemed enshrined ; while on that ivory-throned brow , old saturn cross-legged sat . the whole countenance of this man , the whole air and look of this man , expressed a cheerful content . cheerful is the adjective , for it was the contrary of gloom ; content -- perhaps acquiescence -- is the substantive , for it was not happiness or delight . but while the personal look and air of this man were thus winning , there was still something latently visible in him which repelled . that something may best be characterized as non-benevolence . non-benevolence seems the best word , for it was neither malice nor ill-will ; but something passive . to crown all , a certain floating atmosphere seemed to invest and go along with this man . that atmosphere seems only renderable in words by the term inscrutableness . though the clothes worn by this man were strictly in accordance with the general style of any unobtrusive gentleman 's dress , yet his clothes seemed to disguise this man . one would almost have said , his very face , the apparently natural glance of his very eye disguised this man .
melville	pierre	now , as this person deliberately passed by pierre , he lifted his hat , gracefully bowed , smiled gently , and passed on . but pierre was all confusion ; he flushed , looked askance , stammered with his hand at his hat to return the courtesy of the other ; he seemed thoroughly upset by the mere sight of this hat-lifting , gracefully bowing , gently-smiling , and most miraculously self-possessed , non-benevolent man .
melville	pierre	now who was this man ? this man was plotinus plinlimmon . pierre had read a treatise of his in a stage-coach coming to the city , and had heard him often spoken of by millthorpe and others as the grand master of a certain mystic society among the apostles . whence he came , no one could tell . his surname was welsh , but he was a tennesseean by birth . he seemed to have no family or blood ties of any sort . he never was known to work with his hands ; never to write with his hands ( he would not even write a letter ) ; he never was known to open a book . there were no books in his chamber . nevertheless , some day or other he must have read books , but that time seemed gone now ; as for the sleazy works that went under his name , they were nothing more than his verbal things , taken down at random , and bunglingly methodized by his young disciples .
melville	pierre	finding plinlimmon thus unfurnished either with books or pen and paper , and imputing it to something like indigence , a foreign scholar , a rich nobleman , who chanced to meet him once , sent him a fine supply of stationery , with a very fine set of volumes , -- cardan , epictetus , the book of mormon , abraham tucker , condorcet and the zenda-vesta . but this noble foreign scholar calling next day -- perhaps in expectation of some compliment for his great kindness -- started aghast at his own package deposited just without the door of plinlimmon , and with all fastenings untouched .
melville	pierre	`` missent , '' said plotinus plinlimmon placidly : `` if any thing , i looked for some choice curaçoa from a nobleman like you . i should be very happy , my dear count , to accept a few jugs of choice curaçoa . ''
melville	pierre	`` i thought that the society of which you are the head , excluded all things of that sort '' -- replied the count . `` dear count , so they do ; but mohammed hath his own dispensation . ''
melville	pierre	`` ah ! i see , '' said the noble scholar archly . `` i am afraid you do not see , dear count '' -- said plinlimmon ; and instantly before the eyes of the count , the inscrutable atmosphere eddied and eddied roundabout this plotinus plinlimmon .
melville	pierre	his chance brushing encounter in the corridor was the first time that ever pierre had without medium beheld the form or the face of plinlimmon . very early after taking chambers at the apostles ' , he had been struck by a steady observant blue-eyed countenance at one of the loftiest windows of the old gray tower , which on the opposite side of the quadrangular space , rose prominently before his own chamber . only through two panes of glass -- his own and the stranger 's -- had pierre hitherto beheld that remarkable face of repose , -- repose neither divine nor human , nor any thing made up of either or both -- but a repose separate and apart -- a repose of a face by itself . one adequate look at that face conveyed to most philosophical observers a notion of something not before included in their scheme of the universe .
melville	pierre	now as to the mild sun , glass is no hindrance at all , but he transmits his light and life through the glass ; even so through pierre 's panes did the tower face transmit its strange mystery .
melville	pierre	becoming more and more interested in this face , he had questioned millthorpe concerning it `` bless your soul '' -- replied millthorpe -- '' that is plotinus plinlimmon ! our grand master , plotinus plinlimmon ! by gad , you must know plotinus thoroughly , as i have long done . come away with me , now , and let me introduce you instanter to plotinus plinlimmon . ''
melville	pierre	but pierre declined ; and could not help thinking , that though in all human probability plotinus well understood millthorpe , yet millthorpe could hardly yet have wound himself into plotinus ; -- though indeed plotinus -- who at times was capable of assuming a very off-hand , confidential , and simple , sophomorean air -- might , for reasons best known to himself , have tacitly pretended to millthorpe , that he ( millthorpe ) had thoroughly wriggled himself into his ( plotinus ' ) innermost soul .
melville	pierre	a man will be given a book , and when the donor 's back is turned , will carelessly drop it in the first corner ; he is not over-anxious to be bothered with the book . but now personally point out to him the author , and ten to one he goes back to the corner , picks up the book , dusts the cover , and very carefully reads that invaluable work . one does not vitally believe in a man till one 's own two eyes have beheld him . if then , by the force of peculiar circumstances , pierre while in the stage , had formerly been drawn into an attentive perusal of the work on `` chronometricals and horologicals ; '' how then was his original interest heightened by catching a subsequent glimpse of the author . but at the first reading , not being able -- as he thought -- to master the pivot-idea of the pamphlet ; and as every incomprehended idea is not only a perplexity but a taunting reproach to one 's mind , pierre had at last ceased studying it altogether ; nor consciously troubled himself further about it during the remainder of the journey . but still thinking now it might possibly have been mechanically retained by him , he searched all the pockets of his clothes , but without success . he begged millthorpe to do his best toward procuring him another copy ; but it proved impossible to find one . plotinus himself could not furnish it .
melville	pierre	among other efforts , pierre in person had accosted a limping half-deaf old book-stall man , not very far from the apostles ' . `` have you the '_chronometrics_ , ' my friend ? '' forgetting the exact title .
melville	pierre	`` very bad , very bad ! '' said the old man , rubbing his back ; -- '' has had the _chronic-rheumatics_ ever so long ; what 's good for 'em ? '' perceiving his mistake , pierre replied that he did not know what was the infallible remedy .
melville	pierre	`` whist ! let me tell ye , then , young 'un , '' said the old cripple , limping close up to him , and putting his mouth in pierre 's ear -- '' never catch 'em ! -- now 's the time , while you 're young : -- never catch 'em ! ''
melville	pierre	by-and-by the blue-eyed , mystic-mild face in the upper window of the old gray tower began to domineer in a very remarkable manner upon pierre . when in his moods of peculiar depression and despair ; when dark thoughts of his miserable condition would steal over him ; and black doubts as to the integrity of his unprecedented course in life would most malignantly suggest themselves ; when a thought of the vanity of his deep book would glidingly intrude ; if glancing at his closet-window that mystic-mild face met pierre 's ; under any of these influences the effect was surprising , and not to be adequately detailed in any possible words .
melville	pierre	vain ! vain ! vain ! said the face to him . fool ! fool ! fool ! said the face to him . quit ! quit ! quit ! said the face to him . but when he mentally interrogated the face as to why it thrice said vain ! fool ! quit ! to him ; here there was no response . for that face did not respond to any thing . did i not say before that that face was something separate , and apart ; a face by itself ? now , any thing which is thus a thing by itself never responds to any other thing . if to affirm , be to expand one 's isolated self ; and if to deny , be to contract one 's isolated self ; then to respond is a suspension of all isolation . though this face in the tower was so clear and so mild ; though the gay youth apollo was enshrined in that eye , and paternal old saturn sat cross-legged on that ivory brow ; yet somehow to pierre the face at last wore a sort of malicious leer to him . but the kantists might say , that this was a _subjective_ sort of leer in pierre . any way , the face seemed to leer upon pierre . and now it said to him -- _ass ! ass ! ass ! _ this expression was insufferable . he procured some muslin for his closet-window ; and the face became curtained like any portrait . but this did not mend the leer . pierre knew that still the face leered behind the muslin . what was most terrible was the idea that by some magical means or other the face had got hold of his secret . `` ay , '' shuddered pierre , `` the face knows that isabel is not my wife ! and that seems the reason it leers . ''
melville	pierre	then would all manner of wild fancyings float through his soul , and detached sentences of the `` chronometrics '' would vividly recur to him -- sentences before but imperfectly comprehended , but now shedding a strange , baleful light upon his peculiar condition , and emphatically denouncing it . again he tried his best to procure the pamphlet , to read it now by the commentary of the mystic-mild face ; again he searched through the pockets of his clothes for the stage-coach copy , but in vain .
melville	pierre	and when -- at the critical moment of quitting his chambers that morning of the receipt of the fatal tidings -- the face itself -- the man himself -- this inscrutable plotinus plinlimmon himself -- did visibly brush by him in the brick corridor , and all the trepidation he had ever before felt at the mild-mystic aspect in the tower window , now redoubled upon him , so that , as before said , he flushed , looked askance , and stammered with his saluting hand to his hat ; -- then anew did there burn in him the desire of procuring the pamphlet . `` cursed fate that i should have lost it '' -- he cried ; -- '' more cursed , that when i did have it , and did read it , i was such a ninny as not to comprehend ; and now it is all too late ! ''
melville	pierre	yet -- to anticipate here -- when years after , an old jew clothesman rummaged over a surtout of pierre 's -- which by some means had come into his hands -- his lynx-like fingers happened to feel something foreign between the cloth and the heavy quilted bombazine lining . he ripped open the skirt , and found several old pamphlet pages , soft and worn almost to tissue , but still legible enough to reveal the title -- '' chronometricals and horologicals . '' pierre must have ignorantly thrust it into his pocket , in the stage , and it had worked through a rent there , and worked its way clean down into the skirt , and there helped pad the padding . so that all the time he was hunting for this pamphlet , he himself was wearing the pamphlet . when he brushed past plinlimmon in the brick corridor , and felt that renewed intense longing for the pamphlet , then his right hand was not two inches from the pamphlet .
melville	pierre	possibly this curious circumstance may in some sort illustrate his self-supposed non-understanding of the pamphlet , as first read by him in the stage . could he likewise have carried about with him in his mind the thorough understanding of the book , and yet not be aware that he so understood it ? i think that -- regarded in one light -- the final career of pierre will seem to show , that he _did_ understand it . and here it may be randomly suggested , by way of bagatelle , whether some things that men think they do not know , are not for all that thoroughly comprehended by them ; and yet , so to speak , though contained in themselves , are kept a secret from themselves ? the idea of death seems such a thing .
melville	pierre	book xxii . the flower-curtain lifted from before a tropical author , with some remarks on the transcendental flesh-brush philosophy . i . some days passed after the fatal tidings from the meadows , and at length , somewhat mastering his emotions , pierre again sits down in his chamber ; for grieve how he will , yet work he must . and now day succeeds day , and week follows week , and pierre still sits in his chamber . the long rows of cooled brick-kilns around him scarce know of the change ; but from the fair fields of his great-great-great-grandfather 's manor , summer hath flown like a swallow-guest ; the perfidious wight , autumn , hath peeped in at the groves of the maple , and under pretense of clothing them in rich russet and gold , hath stript them at last of the slightest rag , and then ran away laughing ; prophetic icicles depend from the arbors round about the old manorial mansion -- now locked up and abandoned ; and the little , round , marble table in the viny summer-house where , of july mornings , he had sat chatting and drinking negus with his gay mother , is now spread with a shivering napkin of frost ; sleety varnish hath encrusted that once gay mother 's grave , preparing it for its final cerements of wrapping snow upon snow ; wild howl the winds in the woods : it is winter . sweet summer is done ; and autumn is done ; but the book , like the bitter winter , is yet to be finished .
melville	pierre	that season 's wheat is long garnered , pierre ; that season 's ripe apples and grapes are in ; no crop , no plant , no fruit is out ; the whole harvest is done . oh , woe to that belated winter-overtaken plant , which the summer could not bring to maturity ! the drifting winter snows shall whelm it . think , pierre , doth not thy plant belong to some other and tropical clime ? though transplanted to northern maine , the orange-tree of the floridas will put forth leaves in that parsimonious summer , and show some few tokens of fruitage ; yet november will find no golden globes thereon ; and the passionate old lumber-man , december , shall peel the whole tree , wrench it off at the ground , and toss it for a fagot to some lime-kiln . ah , pierre , pierre , make haste ! make haste ! force thy fruitage , lest the winter force thee .
melville	pierre	watch yon little toddler , how long it is learning to stand by itself ! first it shrieks and implores , and will not try to stand at all , unless both father and mother uphold it ; then a little more bold , it must , at least , feel one parental hand , else again the cry and the tremble ; long time is it ere by degrees this child comes to stand without any support . but , by-and-by , grown up to man 's estate , it shall leave the very mother that bore it , and the father that begot it , and cross the seas , perhaps , or settle in far oregon lands . there now , do you see the soul . in its germ on all sides it is closely folded by the world , as the husk folds the tenderest fruit ; then it is born from the world-husk , but still now outwardly clings to it ; -- still clamors for the support of its mother the world , and its father the deity . but it shall yet learn to stand independent , though not without many a bitter wail , and many a miserable fall .
melville	pierre	that hour of the life of a man when first the help of humanity fails him , and he learns that in his obscurity and indigence humanity holds him a dog and no man : that hour is a hard one , but not the hardest . there is still another hour which follows , when he learns that in his infinite comparative minuteness and abjectness , the gods do likewise despise him , and own him not of their clan . divinity and humanity then are equally willing that he should starve in the street for all that either will do for him . now cruel father and mother have both let go his hand , and the little soul-toddler , now you shall hear his shriek and his wail , and often his fall .
melville	pierre	when at saddle meadows , pierre had wavered and trembled in those first wretched hours ensuing upon the receipt of isabel 's letter ; then humanity had let go the hand of pierre , and therefore his cry ; but when at last inured to this , pierre was seated at his book , willing that humanity should desert him , so long as he thought he felt a far higher support ; then , ere long , he began to feel the utter loss of that other support , too ; ay , even the paternal gods themselves did now desert pierre ; the toddler was toddling entirely alone , and not without shrieks .
melville	pierre	if man must wrestle , perhaps it is well that it should be on the nakedest possible plain . the three chambers of pierre at the apostles ' were connecting ones . the first -- having a little retreat where delly slept -- was used for the more exacting domestic purposes : here also their meals were taken ; the second was the chamber of isabel ; the third was the closet of pierre . in the first -- the dining room , as they called it -- there was a stove which boiled the water for their coffee and tea , and where delly concocted their light repasts . this was their only fire ; for , warned again and again to economize to the uttermost , pierre did not dare to purchase any additional warmth . but by prudent management , a very little warmth may go a great way . in the present case , it went some forty feet or more . a horizontal pipe , after elbowing away from above the stove in the dining-room , pierced the partition wall , and passing straight through isabel 's chamber , entered the closet of pierre at one corner , and then abruptly disappeared into the wall , where all further caloric -- if any -- went up through the chimney into the air , to help warm the december sun . now , the great distance of pierre 's calorical stream from its fountain , sadly impaired it , and weakened it . it hardly had the flavor of heat . it would have had but very inconsiderable influence in raising the depressed spirits of the most mercurial thermometer ; certainly it was not very elevating to the spirits of pierre . besides , this calorical stream , small as it was , did not flow through the room , but only entered it , to elbow right out of it , as some coquettish maidens enter the heart ; moreover , it was in the furthest corner from the only place where , with a judicious view to the light , pierre 's desk-barrels and board could advantageously stand . often , isabel insisted upon his having a separate stove to himself ; but pierre would not listen to such a thing . then isabel would offer her own room to him ; saying it was of no indispensable use to her by day ; she could easily spend her time in the dining-room ; but pierre would not listen to such a thing ; he would not deprive her of the comfort of a continually accessible privacy ; besides , he was now used to his own room , and must sit by that particular window there , and no other . then isabel would insist upon keeping her connecting door open while pierre was employed at his desk , that so the heat of her room might bodily go into his ; but pierre would not listen to such a thing : because he must be religiously locked up while at work ; outer love and hate must alike be excluded then . in vain isabel said she would make not the slightest noise , and muffle the point of the very needle she used . all in vain . pierre was inflexible here .
melville	pierre	yes , he was resolved to battle it out in his own solitary closet ; though a strange , transcendental conceit of one of the more erratic and non-conforming apostles , -- who was also at this time engaged upon a profound work above stairs , and who denied himself his full sufficiency of food , in order to insure an abundant fire ; -- the strange conceit of this apostle , i say , -- accidentally communicated to pierre , -- that , through all the kingdoms of nature , caloric was the great universal producer and vivifyer , and could not be prudently excluded from the spot where great books were in the act of creation ; and therefore , he ( the apostle ) for one , was resolved to plant his head in a hot-bed of stove-warmed air , and so force his brain to germinate and blossom , and bud , and put forth the eventual , crowning , victorious flower ; -- though indeed this conceit rather staggered pierre -- for in truth , there was no small smack of plausible analogy in it -- yet one thought of his purse would wholly expel the unwelcome intrusion , and reinforce his own previous resolve .
melville	pierre	however lofty and magnificent the movements of the stars ; whatever celestial melodies they may thereby beget ; yet the astronomers assure us that they are the most rigidly methodical of all the things that exist . no old housewife goes her daily domestic round with one millionth part the precision of the great planet jupiter in his stated and unalterable revolutions . he has found his orbit , and stays in it ; he has timed himself , and adheres to his periods . so , in some degree with pierre , now revolving in the troubled orbit of his book .
melville	pierre	pierre rose moderately early ; and the better to inure himself to the permanent chill of his room , and to defy and beard to its face , the cruelest cold of the outer air ; he would -- behind the curtain -- throw down the upper sash of his window ; and on a square of old painted canvas , formerly wrapping some bale of goods in the neighborhood , treat his limbs , of those early december mornings , to a copious ablution , in water thickened with incipient ice . nor , in this stoic performance , was he at all without company , -- not present , but adjoiningly sympathetic ; for scarce an apostle in all those scores and scores of chambers , but undeviatingly took his daily december bath . pierre had only to peep out of his pane and glance round the multi-windowed , inclosing walls of the quadrangle , to catch plentiful half-glimpses , all round him , of many a lean , philosophical nudity , refreshing his meager bones with crash-towel and cold water . `` quick be the play , '' was their motto : `` lively our elbows , and nimble all our tenuities . '' oh , the dismal echoings of the raspings of flesh-brushes , perverted to the filing and polishing of the merest ribs ! oh , the shuddersome splashings of pails of ice-water over feverish heads , not unfamiliar with aches ! oh , the rheumatical cracklings of rusted joints , in that defied air of december ! for every thick-frosted sash was down , and every lean nudity courted the zephyr !
melville	pierre	among all the innate , hyena-like repellants to the reception of any set form of a spiritually-minded and pure archetypical faith , there is nothing so potent in its skeptical tendencies , as that inevitable perverse ridiculousness , which so often bestreaks some of the essentially finest and noblest aspirations of those men , who disgusted with the common conventional quackeries , strive , in their clogged terrestrial humanities , after some imperfectly discerned , but heavenly ideals : ideals , not only imperfectly discerned in themselves , but the path to them so little traceable , that no two minds will entirely agree upon it .
melville	pierre	hardly a new-light apostle , but who , in superaddition to his revolutionary scheme for the minds and philosophies of men , entertains some insane , heterodoxical notions about the economy of his body . his soul , introduced by the gentlemanly gods , into the supernal society , -- practically rejects that most sensible maxim of men of the world , who chancing to gain the friendship of any great character , never make that the ground of boring him with the supplemental acquaintance of their next friend , who perhaps , is some miserable ninny . love me , love my dog , is only an adage for the old country-women who affectionately kiss their cows . the gods love the soul of a man ; often , they will frankly accost it ; but they abominate his body ; and will forever cut it dead , both here and hereafter . so , if thou wouldst go to the gods , leave thy dog of a body behind thee . and most impotently thou strivest with thy purifying cold baths , and thy diligent scrubbings with flesh-brushes , to prepare it as a meet offering for their altar . nor shall all thy pythagorean and shellian dietings on apple-parings , dried prunes , and crumbs of oat-meal cracker , ever fit thy body for heaven . feed all things with food convenient for them , -- that is , if the food be procurable . the food of thy soul is light and space ; feed it then on light and space . but the food of thy body is champagne and oysters ; feed it then on champagne and oysters ; and so shall it merit a joyful resurrection , if there is any to be . say , wouldst thou rise with a lantern jaw and a spavined knee ? rise with brawn on thee , and a most royal corporation before thee ; so shalt thou in that day claim respectful attention . know this : that while many a consumptive dietarian has but produced the merest literary flatulencies to the world ; convivial authors have alike given utterance to the sublimest wisdom , and created the least gross and most ethereal forms . and for men of demonstrative muscle and action , consider that right royal epitaph which cyrus the great caused to be engraved on his tomb -- '' i could drink a great deal of wine , and it did me a great deal of good . '' ah , foolish ! to think that by starving thy body , thou shalt fatten thy soul ! is yonder ox fatted because yonder lean fox starves in the winter wood ? and prate not of despising thy body , while still thou flourisheth thy flesh-brush ! the finest houses are most cared for within ; the outer walls are freely left to the dust and the soot . put venison in thee , and so wit shall come out of thee . it is one thing in the mill , but another in the sack .
melville	pierre	now it was the continual , quadrangular example of those forlorn fellows , the apostles , who , in this period of his half-developments and transitions , had deluded pierre into the flesh-brush philosophy , and had almost tempted him into the apple-parings dialectics . for all the long wards , corridors , and multitudinous chambers of the apostles ' were scattered with the stems of apples , the stones of prunes , and the shells of peanuts . they went about huskily muttering the kantian categories through teeth and lips dry and dusty as any miller 's , with the crumbs of graham crackers . a tumbler of cold water was the utmost welcome to their reception rooms ; at the grand supposed sanhedrim presided over by one of the deputies of plotinus plinlimmon , a huge jug of adam 's ale , and a bushel-basket of graham crackers were the only convivials . continually bits of cheese were dropping from their pockets , and old shiny apple parchments were ignorantly exhibited every time they drew out a manuscript to read you . some were curious in the vintages of waters ; and in three glass decanters set before you , fairmount , croton , and cochituate ; they held that croton was the most potent , fairmount a gentle tonic , and cochituate the mildest and least inebriating of all . take some more of the croton , my dear sir ! be brisk with the fairmount ! why stops that cochituate ? so on their philosophical tables went round their port , their sherry , and their claret .
melville	pierre	some , further advanced , rejected mere water in the bath , as altogether too coarse an element ; and so , took to the vapor-baths , and steamed their lean ribs every morning . the smoke which issued from their heads , and overspread their pages , was prefigured in the mists that issued from under their door-sills and out of their windows . some could not sit down of a morning until after first applying the vapor-bath outside and then thoroughly rinsing out their interiors with five cups of cold croton . they were as faithfully replenished fire-buckets ; and could they , standing in one cordon , have consecutively pumped themselves into each other , then the great fire of 1835 had been far less wide-spread and disastrous .
melville	pierre	ah ! ye poor lean ones ! ye wretched soakites and vaporites ! have not your niggardly fortunes enough rinsed ye out , and wizened ye , but ye must still be dragging the hose-pipe , and throwing still more cold croton on yourselves and the world ? ah ! attach the screw of your hose-pipe to some fine old butt of madeira ! pump us some sparkling wine into the world ! see , see , already , from all eternity , two-thirds of it have lain helplessly soaking !
melville	pierre	ii . with cheek rather pale , then , and lips rather blue , pierre sits down to his plank . but is pierre packed in the mail for st. petersburg this morning ? over his boots are his moccasins ; over his ordinary coat is his surtout ; and over that , a cloak of isabel 's . now he is squared to his plank ; and at his hint , the affectionate isabel gently pushes his chair closer to it , for he is so muffled , he can hardly move of himself . now delly comes in with bricks hot from the stove ; and now isabel and she with devoted solicitude pack away these comforting stones in the folds of an old blue cloak , a military garment of the grandfather of pierre , and tenderly arrange it both over and under his feet ; but putting the warm flagging beneath . then delly brings still another hot brick to put under his inkstand , to prevent the ink from thickening . then isabel drags the camp-bedstead nearer to him , on which are the two or three books he may possibly have occasion to refer to that day , with a biscuit or two , and some water , and a clean towel , and a basin . then she leans against the plank by the elbow of pierre , a crook-ended stick . is pierre a shepherd , or a bishop , or a cripple ? no , but he has in effect , reduced himself to the miserable condition of the last . with the crook-ended cane , pierre -- unable to rise without sadly impairing his manifold intrenchments , and admitting the cold air into their innermost nooks , -- pierre , if in his solitude , he should chance to need any thing beyond the reach of his arm , then the crook-ended cane drags it to his immediate vicinity .
melville	pierre	pierre glances slowly all round him ; every thing seems to be right ; he looks up with a grateful , melancholy satisfaction at isabel ; a tear gathers in her eye ; but she conceals it from him by coming very close to him , stooping over , and kissing his brow . 't is her lips that leave the warm moisture there ; not her tears , she says .
melville	pierre	`` i suppose i must go now , pierre . now do n't , do n't be so long to-day . i will call thee at half-past four . thou shalt not strain thine eyes in the twilight . ''
melville	pierre	`` we will _see_ about that , '' says pierre , with an unobserved attempt at a very sad pun . `` come , thou must go . leave me . '' and there he is left . pierre is young ; heaven gave him the divinest , freshest form of a man ; put light into his eye , and fire into his blood , and brawn into his arm , and a joyous , jubilant , overflowing , upbubbling , universal life in him everywhere . now look around in that most miserable room , and at that most miserable of all the pursuits of a man , and say if here be the place , and this be the trade , that god intended him for . a rickety chair , two hollow barrels , a plank , paper , pens , and infernally black ink , four leprously dingy white walls , no carpet , a cup of water , and a dry biscuit or two . oh , i hear the leap of the texan camanche , as at this moment he goes crashing like a wild deer through the green underbrush ; i hear his glorious whoop of savage and untamable health ; and then i look in at pierre . if physical , practical unreason make the savage , which is he ? civilization , philosophy , ideal virtue ! behold your victim !
melville	pierre	iii . some hours pass . let us peep over the shoulder of pierre , and see what it is he is writing there , in that most melancholy closet . here , topping the reeking pile by his side , is the last sheet from his hand , the frenzied ink not yet entirely dry . it is much to our purpose ; for in this sheet , he seems to have directly plagiarized from his own experiences , to fill out the mood of his apparent author-hero , vivia , who thus soliloquizes : `` a deep-down , unutterable mournfulness is in me . now i drop all humorous or indifferent disguises , and all philosophical pretensions . i own myself a brother of the clod , a child of the primeval gloom . hopelessness and despair are over me , as pall on pall . away , ye chattering apes of a sophomorean spinoza and plato , who once didst all but delude me that the night was day , and pain only a tickle . explain this darkness , exorcise this devil , ye can not . tell me not , thou inconceivable coxcomb of a goethe , that the universe can not spare thee and thy immortality , so long as -- like a hired waiter -- thou makest thyself 'generally useful . ' already the universe gets on without thee , and could still spare a million more of the same identical kidney . corporations have no souls , and thy pantheism , what was that ? thou wert but the pretensious , heartless part of a man . lo ! i hold thee in this hand , and thou art crushed in it like an egg from which the meat hath been sucked . ''
melville	pierre	here is a slip from the floor . `` whence flow the panegyrical melodies that precede the march of these heroes ? from what but from a sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal ! ''
melville	pierre	and here is a second . `` cast thy eye in there on vivia ; tell me why those four limbs should be clapt in a dismal jail -- day out , day in -- week out , week in -- month out , month in -- and himself the voluntary jailer ! is this the end of philosophy ? this the larger , and spiritual life ? this your boasted empyrean ? is it for this that a man should grow wise , and leave off his most excellent and calumniated folly ? ''
melville	pierre	and here is a third . `` cast thy eye in there on vivia ; he , who in the pursuit of the highest health of virtue and truth , shows but a pallid cheek ! weigh his heart in thy hand , oh , thou gold-laced , virtuoso goethe ! and tell me whether it does not exceed thy standard weight ! ''
melville	pierre	and here is a fourth . `` oh god , that man should spoil and rust on the stalk , and be wilted and threshed ere the harvest hath come ! and oh god , that men that call themselves men should still insist on a laugh ! i hate the world , and could trample all lungs of mankind as grapes , and heel them out of their breath , to think of the woe and the cant , -- to think of the truth and the lie ! oh ! blessed be the twenty-first day of december , and cursed be the twenty-first day of june ! ''
melville	pierre	from these random slips , it would seem , that pierre is quite conscious of much that is so anomalously hard and bitter in his lot , of much that is so black and terrific in his soul . yet that knowing his fatal condition does not one whit enable him to change or better his condition . conclusive proof that he has no power over his condition . for in tremendous extremities human souls are like drowning men ; well enough they know they are in peril ; well enough they know the causes of that peril ; -- nevertheless , the sea is the sea , and these drowning men do drown .
melville	pierre	iv . from eight o'clock in the morning till half-past four in the evening , pierre sits there in his room ; -- eight hours and a half ! from throbbing neck-bands , and swinging belly-bands of gay-hearted horses , the sleigh-bells chimingly jingle ; -- but pierre sits there in his room ; thanksgiving comes , with its glad thanks , and crisp turkeys ; -- but pierre sits there in his room ; soft through the snows , on tinted indian moccasin , merry christmas comes stealing ; -- but pierre sits there in his room ; it is new-year 's , and like a great flagon , the vast city overbrims at all curb-stones , wharves , and piers , with bubbling jubilations ; -- but pierre sits there in his room : -- nor jingling sleigh-bells at throbbing neck-band , or swinging belly-band ; nor glad thanks , and crisp turkeys of thanksgiving ; nor tinted indian moccasin of merry christmas softly stealing through the snows ; nor new-year 's curb-stones , wharves , and piers , over-brimming with bubbling jubilations : -- nor jingling sleigh-bells , nor glad thanksgiving , nor merry christmas , nor jubilating new year 's : -- nor bell , thank , christ , year ; -- none of these are for pierre . in the midst of the merriments of the mutations of time , pierre hath ringed himself in with the grief of eternity . pierre is a peak inflexible in the heart of time , as the isle-peak , piko , stands unassaultable in the midst of waves .
melville	pierre	he will not be called to ; he will not be stirred . sometimes the intent ear of isabel in the next room , overhears the alternate silence , and then the long lonely scratch of his pen . it is , as if she heard the busy claw of some midnight mole in the ground . sometimes , she hears a low cough , and sometimes the scrape of his crook-handled cane .
melville	pierre	here surely is a wonderful stillness of eight hours and a half , repeated day after day . in the heart of such silence , surely something is at work . is it creation , or destruction ? builds pierre the noble world of a new book ? or does the pale haggardness unbuild the lungs and the life in him ? -- unutterable , that a man should be thus !
melville	pierre	when in the meridian flush of the day , we recall the black apex of night ; then night seems impossible ; this sun can never go down . oh that the memory of the uttermost gloom as an already tasted thing to the dregs , should be no security against its return . one may be passibly well one day , but the next , he may sup at black broth with pluto .
melville	pierre	is there then all this work to one book , which shall be read in a very few hours ; and , far more frequently , utterly skipped in one second ; and which , in the end , whatever it be , must undoubtedly go to the worms ?
melville	pierre	not so ; that which now absorbs the time and the life of pierre , is not the book , but the primitive elementalizing of the strange stuff , which in the act of attempting that book , have upheaved and upgushed in his soul . two books are being writ ; of which the world shall only see one , and that the bungled one . the larger book , and the infinitely better , is for pierre 's own private shelf . that it is , whose unfathomable cravings drink his blood ; the other only demands his ink . but circumstances have so decreed , that the one can not be composed on the paper , but only as the other is writ down in his soul . and the one of the soul is elephantinely sluggish , and will not budge at a breath . thus pierre is fastened on by two leeches ; -- how then can the life of pierre last ? lo ! he is fitting himself for the highest life , by thinning his blood and collapsing his heart . he is learning how to live , by rehearsing the part of death .
melville	pierre	who shall tell all the thoughts and feelings of pierre in that desolate and shivering room , when at last the idea obtruded , that the wiser and the profounder he should grow , the more and the more he lessened the chances for bread ; that could he now hurl his deep book out of the window , and fall to on some shallow nothing of a novel , composable in a month at the longest , then could he reasonably hope for both appreciation and cash . but the devouring profundities , now opened up in him , consume all his vigor ; would he , he could not now be entertainingly and profitably shallow in some pellucid and merry romance . now he sees , that with every accession of the personal divine to him , some great land-slide of the general surrounding divineness slips from him , and falls crashing away . said i not that the gods , as well as mankind , had unhanded themselves from this pierre ? so now in him you behold the baby toddler i spoke of ; forced now to stand and toddle alone .
melville	pierre	now and then he turns to the camp-bed , and wetting his towel in the basin , presses it against his brow . now he leans back in his chair , as if to give up ; but again bends over and plods .
melville	pierre	twilight draws on , the summons of isabel is heard from the door ; the poor , frozen , blue-lipped , soul-shivering traveler for st. petersburg is unpacked ; and for a moment stands toddling on the floor . then his hat , and his cane , and out he sallies for fresh air . a most comfortless staggering of a stroll ! people gaze at him passing , as at some imprudent sick man , willfully burst from his bed . if an acquaintance is met , and would say a pleasant newsmonger 's word in his ear , that acquaintance turns from him , affronted at his hard aspect of icy discourtesy . `` bad-hearted , '' mutters the man , and goes on .
melville	pierre	he comes back to his chambers , and sits down at the neat table of delly ; and isabel soothingly eyes him , and presses him to eat and be strong . but his is the famishing which loathes all food . he can not eat but by force . he has assassinated the natural day ; how then can he eat with an appetite ? if he lays him down , he can not sleep ; he has waked the infinite wakefulness in him ; then how can he slumber ? still his book , like a vast lumbering planet , revolves in his aching head . he can not command the thing out of its orbit ; fain would he behead himself , to gain one night 's repose . at last the heavy hours move on ; and sheer exhaustion overtakes him , and he lies still -- not asleep as children and day-laborers sleep -- but he lies still from his throbbings , and for that interval holdingly sheaths the beak of the vulture in his hand , and lets it not enter his heart .
melville	pierre	morning comes ; again the dropt sash , the icy water , the flesh-brush , the breakfast , the hot bricks , the ink , the pen , the from-eight-o'clock-to-half-past-four , and the whole general inclusive hell of the same departed day .
melville	pierre	ah ! shivering thus day after day in his wrappers and cloaks , is this the warm lad that once sung to the world of the tropical summer ? book xxiii . a letter for pierre . isabel . arrival of lucy 's easel and trunks at the apostles ' .
melville	pierre	i . if a frontier man be seized by wild indians , and carried far and deep into the wilderness , and there held a captive , with no slightest probability of eventual deliverance ; then the wisest thing for that man is to exclude from his memory by every possible method , the least images of those beloved objects now forever reft from him . for the more delicious they were to him in the now departed possession , so much the more agonizing shall they be in the present recalling . and though a strong man may sometimes succeed in strangling such tormenting memories ; yet , if in the beginning permitted to encroach upon him unchecked , the same man shall , in the end , become as an idiot . with a continent and an ocean between him and his wife -- thus sundered from her , by whatever imperative cause , for a term of long years ; -- the husband , if passionately devoted to her , and by nature broodingly sensitive of soul , is wise to forget her till he embrace her again ; -- is wise never to remember her if he hear of her death . and though such complete suicidal forgettings prove practically impossible , yet is it the shallow and ostentatious affections alone which are bustling in the offices of obituarian memories . _the love deep as death_ -- what mean those five words , but that such love can not live , and be continually remembering that the loved one is no more ? if it be thus then in cases where entire unremorsefulness as regards the beloved absent objects is presumed , how much more intolerable , when the knowledge of their hopeless wretchedness occurs , attended by the visitations of before latent upbraidings in the rememberer as having been any way -- even unwillingly -- the producers of their sufferings . there seems no other sane recourse for some moody organizations on whom such things , under such circumstances intrude , but right and left to flee them , whatever betide .
melville	pierre	if little or nothing hitherto has been said of lucy tartan in reference to the condition of pierre after his departure from the meadows , it has only been because her image did not willingly occupy his soul . he had striven his utmost to banish it thence ; and only once -- on receiving the tidings of glen 's renewed attentions -- did he remit the intensity of those strivings , or rather feel them , as impotent in him in that hour of his manifold and overwhelming prostration .
melville	pierre	not that the pale form of lucy , swooning on her snow-white bed ; not that the inexpressible anguish of the shriek -- '' my heart ! my heart ! '' would not now at times force themselves upon him , and cause his whole being to thrill with a nameless horror and terror . but the very thrillingness of the phantom made him to shun it , with all remaining might of his spirit .
melville	pierre	nor were there wanting still other , and far more wonderful , though but dimly conscious influences in the breast of pierre , to meet as repellants the imploring form . not to speak of his being devoured by the all-exacting theme of his book , there were sinister preoccupations in him of a still subtler and more fearful sort , of which some inklings have already been given .
melville	pierre	it was while seated solitary in his room one morning ; his flagging faculties seeking a momentary respite ; his head sideways turned toward the naked floor , following the seams in it , which , as wires , led straight from where he sat to the connecting door , and disappeared beneath it into the chamber of isabel ; that he started at a tap at that very door , followed by the wonted , low , sweet voice , --
melville	pierre	`` pierre ! a letter for thee -- dost thou hear ? a letter , -- may i come in ? '' at once he felt a dart of surprise and apprehension ; for he was precisely in that general condition with respect to the outer world , that he could not reasonably look for any tidings but disastrous , or at least , unwelcome ones . he assented ; and isabel entered , holding out the billet in her hand .
melville	pierre	`` 't is from some lady , pierre ; who can it be ? -- not thy mother though , of that i am certain ; -- the expression of her face , as seen by me , not at all answering to the expression of this handwriting here . ''
melville	pierre	`` my mother ? from my mother ? '' muttered pierre , in wild vacancy -- '' no ! no ! it can scarce be from her. -- oh , she writes no more , even in her own private tablets now ! death hath stolen the last leaf , and rubbed all out , to scribble his own ineffaceable _hic jacet_ there ! ''
melville	pierre	`` pierre ! '' cried isabel , in affright . `` give it me ! '' he shouted , vehemently , extending his hand . `` forgive me , sweet , sweet isabel , i have wandered in my mind ; this book makes me mad . there ; i have it now '' -- in a tone of indifference -- '' now , leave me again . it is from some pretty aunt , or cousin , i suppose , '' carelessly balancing the letter in his hand .
melville	pierre	isabel quitted the room ; the moment the door closed upon her , pierre eagerly split open the letter , and read : -- ii . `` this morning i vowed it , my own dearest , dearest pierre i feel stronger to-day ; for to-day i have still more thought of thine own superhuman , angelical strength ; which so , has a very little been transferred to me . oh , pierre , pierre , with what words shall i write thee now ; -- now , when still knowing nothing , yet something of thy secret i , as a seer , suspect . grief , -- deep , unspeakable grief , hath made me this seer . i could murder myself , pierre , when i think of my previous blindness ; but that only came from my swoon . it was horrible and most murdersome ; but now i see thou wert right in being so instantaneous with me , and in never afterward writing to me , pierre ; yes , now i see it , and adore thee the more .
melville	pierre	`` ah ! thou too noble and angelical pierre , now i feel that a being like thee , can possibly have no love as other men love ; but thou lovest as angels do ; not for thyself , but wholly for others . but still are we one , pierre ; thou art sacrificing thyself , and i hasten to re-tie myself to thee , that so i may catch thy fire , and all the ardent multitudinous arms of our common flames may embrace . i will ask of thee nothing , pierre ; thou shalt tell me no secret . very right wert thou , pierre , when , in that ride to the hills , thou wouldst not swear the fond , foolish oath i demanded . very right , very right ; now i see it .
melville	pierre	`` if then i solemnly vow , never to seek from thee any slightest thing which thou wouldst not willingly have me know ; if ever i , in all outward actions , shall recognize , just as thou dost , the peculiar position of that mysterious , and ever-sacred being ; -- then , may i not come and live with thee ? i will be no encumbrance to thee . i know just where thou art , and how thou art living ; and only just there , pierre , and only just so , is any further life endurable , or possible for me . she will never know -- for thus far i am sure thou thyself hast never disclosed it to her what i once was to thee . let it seem , as though i were some nun-like cousin immovably vowed to dwell with thee in thy strange exile . show not to me , -- never show more any visible conscious token of love . i will never to thee . our mortal lives , oh , my heavenly pierre , shall henceforth be one mute wooing of each other ; with no declaration ; no bridal ; till we meet in the pure realms of god 's final blessedness for us ; -- till we meet where the ever-interrupting and ever-marring world can not and shall not come ; where all thy hidden , glorious unselfishness shall be gloriously revealed in the full splendor of that heavenly light ; where , no more forced to these cruelest disguises , she , _she_ too shall assume her own glorious place , nor take it hard , but rather feel the more blessed , when , there , thy sweet heart , shall be openly and unreservedly mine . pierre , pierre , my pierre ! -- only this thought , this hope , this sublime faith now supports me . well was it , that the swoon , in which thou didst leave me , that long eternity ago -- well was it , dear pierre , that though i came out of it to stare and grope , yet it was only to stare and grope , and then i swooned again , and then groped again , and then again swooned . but all this was vacancy ; little i clutched ; nothing i knew ; 't was less than a dream , my pierre , i had no conscious thought of thee , love ; but felt an utter blank , a vacancy ; -- for wert thou not then utterly gone from me ? and what could there then be left of poor lucy ? -- but now , this long , long swoon is past ; i come out again into life and light ; but how could i come out , how could i any way _be_ , my pierre , if not in thee ? so the moment i came out of the long , long swoon , straightway came to me the immortal faith in thee , which though it could offer no one slightest possible argument of mere sense in thy behalf , yet was it only the more mysteriously imperative for that , my pierre . know then , dearest pierre , that with every most glaring earthly reason to disbelieve in thy love ; i do yet wholly give myself up to the unshakable belief in it . for i feel , that always is love love , and can not know change , pierre ; i feel that heaven hath called me to a wonderful office toward thee . by throwing me into that long , long swoon , -- during which , martha tells me , i hardly ate altogether , three ordinary meals , -- by that , heaven , i feel now , was preparing me for the superhuman office i speak of ; was wholly estranging me from this earth , even while i yet lingered in it ; was fitting me for a celestial mission in terrestrial elements . oh , give to me of thine own dear strength ! i am but a poor weak girl , dear pierre ; one that didst once love thee but too fondly , and with earthly frailty . but now i shall be wafted far upward from that ; shall soar up to thee , where thou sittest in thine own calm , sublime heaven of heroism .
melville	pierre	`` oh seek not to dissuade me , pierre . wouldst thou slay me , and slay me a million times more ? and never have done with murdering me ? i must come ! i must come ! god himself can not stay me , for it is he that commands me. -- i know all that will follow my flight to thee ; -- my amazed mother , my enraged brothers , the whole taunting and despising world. -- but thou art my mother and my brothers , and all the world , and all heaven , and all the universe to me -- thou _art_ my pierre . one only being does this soul in me serve -- and that is thee , pierre. -- so i am coming to thee , pierre , and quickly ; -- to-morrow it shall be , and never more will i quit thee , pierre . speak thou immediately to her about me ; thou shalt know best what to say . is there not some connection between our families , pierre ? i have heard my mother sometimes trace such a thing out , -- some indirect cousinship . if thou approvest then , thou shalt say to her , i am thy cousin , pierre ; -- thy resolved and immovable nun-like cousin ; vowed to dwell with thee forever ; to serve thee and her , to guard thee and her without end . prepare some little corner for me somewhere ; but let it be very near . ere i come , i shall send a few little things , -- the tools i shall work by , pierre , and so contribute to the welfare of all . look for me then . i am coming ! i am coming , my pierre ; for a deep , deep voice assures me , that all noble as thou art , pierre , some terrible jeopardy involves thee , which my continual presence only can drive away . i am coming ! i am coming ! ''
melville	pierre	lucy . iii . when surrounded by the base and mercenary crew , man , too long wonted to eye his race with a suspicious disdain , suddenly is brushed by some angelical plume of humanity , and the human accents of superhuman love , and the human eyes of superhuman beauty and glory , suddenly burst on his being ; then how wonderful and fearful the shock ! it is as if the sky-cope were rent , and from the black valley of jehoshaphat , he caught upper glimpses of the seraphim in the visible act of adoring .
melville	pierre	he held the artless , angelical letter in his unrealizing hand ; he started , and gazed round his room , and out at the window , commanding the bare , desolate , all-forbidding quadrangle , and then asked himself whether this was the place that an angel should choose for its visit to earth . then he felt a vast , out-swelling triumphantness , that the girl whose rare merits his intuitive soul had once so clearly and passionately discerned , should indeed , in this most tremendous of all trials , have acquitted herself with such infinite majesty . then again , he sunk utterly down from her , as in a bottomless gulf , and ran shuddering through hideous galleries of despair , in pursuit of some vague , white shape , and lo ! two unfathomable dark eyes met his , and isabel stood mutely and mournfully , yet all-ravishingly before him .
melville	pierre	he started up from his plank ; cast off his manifold wrappings , and crossed the floor to remove himself from the spot , where such sweet , such sublime , such terrific revelations had been made him .
melville	pierre	then a timid little rap was heard at the door . `` pierre , pierre ; now that thou art risen , may i not come in -- just for a moment , pierre . '' `` come in , isabel . '' she was approaching him in her wonted most strange and sweetly mournful manner , when he retreated a step from her , and held out his arm , not seemingly to invite , but rather as if to warn .
melville	pierre	she looked fixedly in his face , and stood rooted . `` isabel , another is coming to me . thou dost not speak , isabel . she is coming to dwell with us so long as we live , isabel . wilt thou not speak ? ''
melville	pierre	the girl still stood rooted ; the eyes , which she had first fixed on him , still remained wide-openly riveted . `` wilt thou not speak , isabel ? '' said pierre , terrified at her frozen , immovable aspect , yet too terrified to manifest his own terror to her ; and still coming slowly near her . she slightly raised one arm , as if to grasp some support ; then turned her head slowly sideways toward the door by which she had entered ; then her dry lips slowly parted -- '' my bed ; lay me ; lay me ! ''
melville	pierre	the verbal effort broke her stiffening enchantment of frost ; her thawed form sloped sidelong into the air ; but pierre caught her , and bore her into her own chamber , and laid her there on the bed .
melville	pierre	`` fan me ; fan me ! '' he fanned the fainting flame of her life ; by-and-by she turned slowly toward him . `` oh ! that feminine word from thy mouth , dear pierre : -- that _she_ , that _she_ ! ''
melville	pierre	pierre sat silent , fanning her . `` oh , i want none in the world but thee , my brother -- but thee , but thee ! and , oh god ! am _i_ not enough for thee ? bare earth with my brother were all heaven for me ; but all my life , all my full soul , contents not my brother . ''
melville	pierre	pierre spoke not ; he but listened ; a terrible , burning curiosity was in him , that made him as heartless . but still all that she had said thus far was ambiguous . `` had i known -- had i but known it before ! oh bitterly cruel to reveal it now . that _she_ ! that _she_ ! ''
melville	pierre	she raised herself suddenly , and almost fiercely confronted him . `` either thou hast told thy secret , or she is not worthy the commonest love of man ! speak pierre , -- which ? '' `` the secret is still a secret , isabel . ''
melville	pierre	`` then is she worthless , pierre , whoever she be -- foolishly , madly fond ! -- doth not the world know me for thy wife ? -- she shall not come ! 'twere a foul blot on thee and me . she shall not come ! one look from me shall murder her , pierre ! ''
melville	pierre	`` this is madness , isabel . look : now reason with me . did i not before opening the letter , say to thee , that doubtless it was from some pretty young aunt or cousin ? ''
melville	pierre	`` speak quick ! -- a cousin ? '' `` a cousin , isabel . '' `` yet , yet , that is not wholly out of the degree , i have heard . tell me more , and quicker ! more ! more ! '' `` a very strange cousin , isabel ; almost a nun in her notions . hearing of our mysterious exile , she , without knowing the cause , hath yet as mysteriously vowed herself ours -- not so much mine , isabel , as ours , _ours_ -- to serve _us_ ; and by some sweet heavenly fancying , to guide us and guard us here . ''
melville	pierre	`` then , possibly , it may be all very well , pierre , my brother -- my _brother_ -- i can say that now ? '' `` any , -- all words are thine , isabel ; words and worlds with all their containings , shall be slaves to thee , isabel . ''
melville	pierre	she looked eagerly and inquiringly at him ; then dropped her eyes , and touched his hand ; then gazed again . `` speak so more to me , pierre ! thou art my brother ; art thou not my brother ? -- but tell me now more of -- her ; it is all newness , and utter strangeness to me , pierre . ''
melville	pierre	`` i have said , my sweetest sister , that she has this wild , nun-like notion in her . she is willful in it ; in this letter she vows she must and will come , and nothing on earth shall stay her . do not have any sisterly jealousy , then , my sister . thou wilt find her a most gentle , unobtrusive , ministering girl , isabel . she will never name the not-to-be-named things to thee ; nor hint of them ; because she knows them not . still , without knowing the secret , she yet hath the vague , unspecializing sensation of the secret -- the mystical presentiment , somehow , of the secret . and her divineness hath drowned all womanly curiosity in her ; so that she desires not , in any way , to verify the presentiment ; content with the vague presentiment only ; for in that , she thinks , the heavenly summons to come to us , lies ; -- even there , in that , isabel . dost thou now comprehend me ? ''
melville	pierre	`` i comprehend nothing , pierre ; there is nothing these eyes have ever looked upon , pierre , that this soul comprehended . ever , as now , do i go all a-grope amid the wide mysteriousness of things . yes , she shall come ; it is only one mystery the more . doth she talk in her sleep , pierre ? would it be well , if i slept with her , my brother ? ''
melville	pierre	`` on thy account ; wishful for thy sake ; to leave thee incommoded ; and -- and -- not knowing precisely how things really are ; -- she probably anticipates and desires otherwise , my sister . '' she gazed steadfastly at his outwardly firm , but not interiorly unfaltering aspect ; and then dropped her glance in silence .
melville	pierre	`` yes , she shall come , my brother ; she shall come . but it weaves its thread into the general riddle , my brother. -- hath she that which they call the memory , pierre ; the memory ? hath she that ? ''
melville	pierre	`` we all have the memory , my sister . '' `` not all ! not all ! -- poor bell hath but very little . pierre ! i have seen her in some dream . she is fair-haired -- blue eyes -- she is not quite so tall as i , yet a very little slighter . ''
melville	pierre	pierre started . `` thou hast seen lucy tartan , at saddle meadows ? '' `` is lucy tartan the name ? -- perhaps , perhaps ; -- but also , in the dream , pierre ; she came , with her blue eyes turned beseechingly on me ; she seemed as if persuading me from thee ; -- methought she was then more than thy cousin ; -- methought she was that good angel , which some say , hovers over every human soul ; and methought -- oh , methought that i was thy other , -- thy other angel , pierre . look : see these eyes , -- this hair -- nay , this cheek ; -- all dark , dark , dark , -- and she -- the blue-eyed -- the fair-haired -- oh , once the red-cheeked ! ''
melville	pierre	she tossed her ebon tresses over her ; she fixed her ebon eyes on him . `` say , pierre ; doth not a funerealness invest me ? was ever hearse so plumed ? -- oh , god ! that i had been born with blue eyes , and fair hair ! those make the livery of heaven ! heard ye ever yet of a good angel with dark eyes , pierre ? -- no , no , no -- all blue , blue , blue -- heaven 's own blue -- the clear , vivid , unspeakable blue , which we see in june skies , when all clouds are swept by. -- but the good angel shall come to thee , pierre . then both will be close by thee , my brother ; and thou mayest perhaps elect , -- elect ! -- she shall come ; she shall come. -- when is it to be , dear pierre ? ''
melville	pierre	`` to-morrow , isabel . so it is here written . '' she fixed her eye on the crumpled billet in his hand . `` it were vile to ask , but not wrong to suppose the asking. -- pierre , -- no , i need not say it , -- wouldst thou ? ''
melville	pierre	`` no ; i would not let thee read it , my sister ; i would not ; because i have no right to -- no right -- no right ; -- that is it ; no : i have no right . i will burn it this instant , isabel . ''
melville	pierre	he stepped from her into the adjoining room ; threw the billet into the stove , and watching its last ashes , returned to isabel . she looked with endless intimations upon him . `` it is burnt , but not consumed ; it is gone , but not lost . through stove , pipe , and flue , it hath mounted in flame , and gone as a scroll to heaven ! it shall appear again , my brother. -- woe is me -- woe , woe ! -- woe is me , oh , woe ! do not speak to me , pierre ; leave me now . she shall come . the bad angel shall tend the good ; she shall dwell with us , pierre . mistrust me not ; her considerateness to me , shall be outdone by mine to her. -- let me be alone now , my brother . ''
melville	pierre	iv . though by the unexpected petition to enter his privacy -- a petition he could scarce ever deny to isabel , since she so religiously abstained from preferring it , unless for some very reasonable cause , pierre , in the midst of those conflicting , secondary emotions , immediately following the first wonderful effect of lucy 's strange letter , had been forced to put on , toward isabel , some air of assurance and understanding concerning its contents ; yet at bottom , he was still a prey to all manner of devouring mysteries .
melville	pierre	soon , now , as he left the chamber of isabel , these mysteriousnesses re-mastered him completely ; and as he mechanically sat down in the dining-room chair , gently offered him by delly -- for the silent girl saw that some strangeness that sought stillness was in him ; -- pierre 's mind was revolving how it was possible , or any way conceivable , that lucy should have been inspired with such seemingly wonderful presentiments of something assumed , or disguising , or non-substantial , somewhere and somehow , in his present most singular apparent position in the eye of world . the wild words of isabel yet rang in his ears . it were an outrage upon all womanhood to imagine that lucy , however yet devoted to him in her hidden heart , should be willing to come to him , so long as she supposed , with the rest of the world , that pierre was an ordinarily married man . but how -- what possible reason -- what possible intimation could she have had to suspect the contrary , or to suspect any thing unsound ? for neither at this present time , nor at any subsequent period , did pierre , or could pierre , possibly imagine that in her marvelous presentiments of love she had any definite conceit of the precise nature of the secret which so unrevealingly and enchantedly wrapt him . but a peculiar thought passingly recurred to him here .
melville	pierre	within his social recollections there was a very remarkable case of a youth , who , while all but affianced to a beautiful girl -- one returning his own throbbings with incipient passion -- became somehow casually and momentarily betrayed into an imprudent manifested tenderness toward a second lady ; or else , that second lady 's deeply-concerned friends caused it to be made known to the poor youth , that such committal tenderness toward her he had displayed , nor had it failed to exert its natural effect upon her ; certain it is , this second lady drooped and drooped , and came nigh to dying , all the while raving of the cruel infidelity of her supposed lover ; so that those agonizing appeals , from so really lovely a girl , that seemed dying of grief for him , at last so moved the youth , that -- morbidly disregardful of the fact , that inasmuch as two ladies claimed him , the prior lady had the best title to his hand -- his conscience insanely upbraided him concerning the second lady ; he thought that eternal woe would surely overtake him both here and hereafter if he did not renounce his first love -- terrible as the effort would be both to him and her -- and wed with the second lady ; which he accordingly did ; while , through his whole subsequent life , delicacy and honor toward his thus wedded wife , forbade that by explaining to his first love how it was with him in this matter , he should tranquilize her heart ; and , therefore , in her complete ignorance , she believed that he was willfully and heartlessly false to her ; and so came to a lunatic 's death on his account .
melville	pierre	this strange story of real life , pierre knew to be also familiar to lucy ; for they had several times conversed upon it ; and the first love of the demented youth had been a school-mate of lucy 's , and lucy had counted upon standing up with her as bridesmaid . now , the passing idea was self-suggested to pierre , whether into lucy 's mind some such conceit as this , concerning himself and isabel , might not possibly have stolen . but then again such a supposition proved wholly untenable in the end ; for it did by no means suffice for a satisfactory solution of the absolute motive of the extraordinary proposed step of lucy ; nor indeed by any ordinary law of propriety , did it at all seem to justify that step . therefore , he know not what to think ; hardly what to dream . wonders , nay , downright miracles and no less were sung about love ; but here was the absolute miracle itself -- the out-acted miracle . for infallibly certain he inwardly felt , that whatever her strange conceit ; whatever her enigmatical delusion ; whatever her most secret and inexplicable motive ; still lucy in her own virgin heart remained transparently immaculate , without shadow of flaw or vein . nevertheless , what inconceivable conduct this was in her , which she in her letter so passionately proposed ! altogether , it amazed him ; it confounded him .
melville	pierre	now , that vague , fearful feeling stole into him , that , rail as all atheists will , there is a mysterious , inscrutable divineness in the world -- a god -- a being positively present everywhere ; -- nay , he is now in this room ; the air did part when i here sat down . i displaced the spirit then -- condensed it a little off from this spot . he looked apprehensively around him ; he felt overjoyed at the sight of the humanness of delly .
melville	pierre	while he was thus plunged into this mysteriousness , a knock was heard at the door . delly hesitatingly rose -- '' shall i let any one in , sir ? -- i think it is mr. millthorpe 's knock . ''
melville	pierre	`` go and see -- go and see '' -- said pierre , vacantly . the moment the door was opened , millthorpe -- for it was he -- catching a glimpse of pierre 's seated form , brushed past delly , and loudly entered the room .
melville	pierre	`` ha , ha ! well , my boy , how comes on the inferno ? that is it you are writing ; one is apt to look black while writing infernoes ; you always loved dante . my lad ! i have finished ten metaphysical treatises ; argued five cases before the court ; attended all our society 's meetings ; accompanied our great professor , monsieur volvoon , the lecturer , through his circuit in the philosophical saloons , sharing all the honors of his illustrious triumph ; and by the way , let me tell you , volvoon secretly gives me even more credit than is my due ; for 'pon my soul , i did not help write more than one half , at most , of his lectures ; edited -- anonymously , though -- a learned , scientific work on 'the precise cause of the modifications in the undulatory motion in waves , ' a posthumous work of a poor fellow -- fine lad he was , too -- a friend of mine . yes , here i have been doing all this , while you still are hammering away at that one poor plaguy inferno ! oh , there 's a secret in dispatching these things ; patience ! patience ! you will yet learn the secret . time ! time ! i ca n't teach it to you , my boy , but time can : i wish i could , but i ca n't . ''
melville	pierre	there was another knock at the door . `` oh ! '' cried millthorpe , suddenly turning round to it , `` i forgot , my boy . i came to tell you that there is a porter , with some queer things , inquiring for you . i happened to meet him down stairs in the corridors , and i told him to follow me up -- i would show him the road ; here he is ; let him in , let him in , good delly , my girl . ''
melville	pierre	thus far , the rattlings of millthorpe , if producing any effect at all , had but stunned the averted pierre . but now he started to his feet . a man with his hat on , stood in the door , holding an easel before him .
melville	pierre	`` is this mr. glendinning 's room , gentlemen ? '' `` oh , come in , come in , '' cried millthorpe , `` all right . '' `` oh ! is that _you_ , sir ? well , well , then ; '' and the man set down the easel .
melville	pierre	`` well , my boy , '' exclaimed millthorpe to pierre ; `` you are in the inferno dream yet . look ; that 's what people call an _easel_ , my boy . an _easel_ , an _easel_ -- not a _weasel_ ; you look at it as though you thought it a weasel . come ; wake up , wake up ! you ordered it , i suppose , and here it is . going to paint and illustrate the inferno , as you go along , i suppose . well , my friends tell me it is a great pity my own things aint illustrated . but i ca n't afford it . there now is that hymn to the niger , which i threw into a pigeon-hole , a year or two ago -- that would be fine for illustrations . ''
melville	pierre	`` is it for mr. glendinning you inquire ? '' said pierre now , in a slow , icy tone , to the porter . `` mr. glendinning , sir ; all right , aint it ? '' `` perfectly , '' said pierre mechanically , and casting another strange , rapt , bewildered glance at the easel . `` but something seems strangely wanting here . ay , now i see , i see it : -- villain ! -- the vines ! thou hast torn the green heart-strings ! thou hast but left the cold skeleton of the sweet arbor wherein she once nestled ! thou besotted , heartless hind and fiend , dost thou so much as dream in thy shriveled liver of the eternal mischief thou hast done ? restore thou the green vines ! untrample them , thou accursed ! -- oh my god , my god , trampled vines pounded and crushed in all fibers , how can they live over again , even though they be replanted ! curse thee , thou ! -- nay , nay , '' he added moodily -- '' i was but wandering to myself . '' then rapidly and mockingly -- '' pardon , pardon ! -- porter ; i most humbly crave thy most haughty pardon . '' then imperiously -- '' come , stir thyself , man ; thou hast more below : bring all up . ''
melville	pierre	as the astounded porter turned , he whispered to millthorpe -- '' is he safe ? -- shall i bring 'em ? '' `` oh certainly , '' smiled millthorpe : `` i 'll look out for him ; he 's never really dangerous when i 'm present ; there , go ! ''
melville	pierre	two trunks now followed , with `` l. t. '' blurredly marked upon the ends . `` is that all , my man ? '' said pierre , as the trunks were being put down before him ; `` well , how much ? '' -- that moment his eyes first caught the blurred letters .
melville	pierre	`` prepaid , sir ; but no objection to more . '' pierre stood mute and unmindful , still fixedly eying the blurred letters ; his body contorted , and one side drooping , as though that moment half-way down-stricken with a paralysis , and yet unconscious of the stroke .
melville	pierre	his two companions , momentarily stood motionless in those respective attitudes , in which they had first caught sight of the remarkable change that had come over him . but , as if ashamed of having been thus affected , millthorpe summoning a loud , merry voice , advanced toward pierre , and , tapping his shoulder , cried , `` wake up , wake up , my boy ! -- he says he is prepaid , but no objection to more . ''
melville	pierre	`` prepaid ; -- what 's that ? go , go , and jabber to apes ! '' `` a curious young gentleman , is he not ? '' said millthorpe lightly to the porter ; -- '' look you , my boy , i 'll repeat : -- he says he 's prepaid , but no objection to more . ''
melville	pierre	`` ah ? -- take that then , '' said pierre , vacantly putting something into the porter 's hand . `` and what shall i do with this , sir ? '' said the porter , staring . `` drink a health ; but not mine ; that were mockery ! ''
melville	pierre	`` with a key , sir ? this is a key you gave me . '' `` ah ! -- well , you at least shall not have the thing that unlocks me . give me the key , and take this . ''
melville	pierre	`` ay , ay ! -- here 's the chink ! thank'ee sir , thank'ee . this 'll drink . i aint called a porter for nothing ; stout 's the word ; 2151 is my number ; any jobs , call on me . '' `` do you ever cart a coffin , my man ? '' said pierre .
melville	pierre	`` 'pon my soul ! '' cried millthorpe , gayly laughing , `` if you aint writing an inferno , then -- but never mind . porter ! this gentleman is under medical treatment at present . you had better -- ab ' -- you understand -- 'squatulate , porter ! there , my boy , he is gone ; i understand how to manage these fellows ; there 's a trick in it , my boy -- an off-handed sort of what d 'ye call it ? -- you understand -- the trick ! the trick ! -- the whole world 's a trick . know the trick of it , all 's right ; do n't know , all 's wrong . ha ! ha ! ''
melville	pierre	`` the porter is gone then ? '' said pierre , calmly . `` well , mr. millthorpe , you will have the goodness to follow him . '' `` rare joke ! admirable ! -- good morning , sir . ha , ha ! '' and with his unruffleable hilariousness , millthorpe quitted the room .
melville	pierre	but hardly had the door closed upon him , nor had he yet removed his hand from its outer knob , when suddenly it swung half open again , and thrusting his fair curly head within , millthorpe cried : `` by the way , my boy , i have a word for you . you know that greasy fellow who has been dunning you so of late . well , be at rest there ; he 's paid . i was suddenly made flush yesterday : -- regular flood-tide . you can return it any day , you know -- no hurry ; that 's all. -- but , by the way , -- as you look as though you were going to have company here -- just send for me in case you want to use me -- any bedstead to put up , or heavy things to be lifted about . do n't you and the women do it , now , mind ! that 's all again . addios , my boy . take care of yourself ! ''
melville	pierre	`` stay ! '' cried pierre , reaching forth one hand , but moving neither foot -- '' stay ! '' -- in the midst of all his prior emotions struck by these singular traits in millthorpe . but the door was abruptly closed ; and singing fa , la , la : millthorpe in his seedy coat went tripping down the corridor .
melville	pierre	`` plus heart , minus head , '' muttered pierre , his eyes fixed on the door . `` now , by heaven ! the god that made millthorpe was both a better and a greater than the god that made napoleon or byron. -- plus head , minus heart -- pah ! the brains grow maggoty without a heart ; but the heart 's the preserving salt itself , and can keep sweet without the head. -- delly ! ''
melville	pierre	`` sir ? '' `` my cousin miss tartan is coming here to live with us , delly . that easel , -- those trunks are hers . '' `` good heavens ! -- coming here ? -- your cousin ? -- miss tartan ? '' `` yes , i thought you must have heard of her and me ; -- but it was broken off ; delly . ''
melville	pierre	`` sir ? sir ? '' `` i have no explanation , delly ; and from you , i must have no amazement . my cousin , -- mind , my _cousin_ , miss tartan , is coming to live with us . the next room to this , on the other side there , is unoccupied . that room shall be hers . you must wait upon her , too , delly . ''
melville	pierre	`` certainly sir , certainly ; i will do any thing ; '' said delly trembling ; `` but , -- but -- does mrs. glendin-din -- does my mistress know this ? '' `` my wife knows all '' -- said pierre sternly . `` i will go down and get the key of the room ; and you must sweep it out . ''
melville	pierre	`` what is to be put into it , sir ? '' said delly . `` miss tartan -- why , she is used to all sorts of fine things , -- rich carpets -- wardrobes -- mirrors -- curtains ; -- why , why , why ! '' `` look , '' said pierre , touching an old rug with his foot ; -- '' here is a bit of carpet ; drag that into her room ; here is a chair , put that in ; and for a bed , -- ay , ay , '' he muttered to himself ; `` i have made it for her , and she ignorantly lies on it now ! -- as made -- so lie . oh god ! ''
melville	pierre	`` hark ! my mistress is calling '' -- cried delly , moving toward the opposite room . `` stay ! '' -- cried pierre , grasping her shoulder ; `` if both called at one time from these opposite chambers , and both were swooning , which door would you first fly to ? ''
melville	pierre	the girl gazed at him uncomprehendingly and affrighted a moment ; and then said , -- '' this one , sir '' -- out of mere confusion perhaps , putting her hand on isabel 's latch . `` it is well . now go . ''
melville	pierre	he stood in an intent unchanged attitude till delly returned . `` how is my wife , now ? '' again startled by the peculiar emphasis placed on the magical word _wife_ , delly , who had long before this , been occasionally struck with the infrequency of his using that term ; she looked at him perplexedly , and said half-unconsciously --
melville	pierre	`` your wife , sir ? '' `` ay , is she not ? '' `` god grant that she be -- oh , 't is most cruel to ask that of poor , poor delly , sir ! '' `` tut for thy tears ! never deny it again then ! -- i swear to heaven , she is ! ''
melville	pierre	with these wild words , pierre seized his hat , and departed the room , muttering something about bringing the key of the additional chamber . as the door closed on him , delly dropped on her knees . she lifted her head toward the ceiling , but dropped it again , as if tyrannically awed downward , and bent it low over , till her whole form tremulously cringed to the floor .
melville	pierre	`` god that made me , and that wast not so hard to me as wicked delly deserved , -- god that made me , i pray to thee ! ward it off from me , if it be coming to me . be not deaf to me ; these stony walls -- thou canst hear through them . pity ! pity ! -- mercy , my god ! -- if they are not married ; if i , penitentially seeking to be pure , am now but the servant to a greater sin , than i myself committed : then , pity ! pity ! pity ! pity ! pity ! oh god that made me , -- see me , see me here -- what can delly do ? if i go hence , none will take me in but villains . if i stay , then -- for stay i must -- and they be not married , -- then pity , pity , pity , pity , pity ! ''
melville	pierre	book xxiv . lucy at the apostles . i . next morning , the recently appropriated room adjoining on the other side of the dining-room , presented a different aspect from that which met the eye of delly upon first unlocking it with pierre on the previous evening . two squares of faded carpeting of different patterns , covered the middle of the floor , leaving , toward the surbase , a wide , blank margin around them . a small glass hung in the pier ; beneath that , a little stand , with a foot or two of carpet before it . in one corner was a cot , neatly equipped with bedding . at the outer side of the cot , another strip of carpeting was placed . lucy 's delicate feet should not shiver on the naked floor .
melville	pierre	pierre , isabel , and delly were standing in the room ; isabel 's eyes were fixed on the cot . `` i think it will be pretty cosy now , '' said delly , palely glancing all round , and then adjusting the pillow anew .
melville	pierre	`` there is no warmth , though , '' said isabel . `` pierre , there is no stove in the room . she will be very cold . the pipe -- can we not send it this way ? '' and she looked more intently at him , than the question seemed to warrant .
melville	pierre	`` let the pipe stay where it is , isabel , '' said pierre , answering her own pointed gaze . `` the dining-room door can stand open . she never liked sleeping in a heated room . let all be ; it is well . eh ! but there is a grate here , i see . i will buy coals . yes , yes -- that can be easily done ; a little fire of a morning -- the expense will be nothing . stay , we will have a little fire here now for a welcome . she shall always have fire . ''
melville	pierre	`` better change the pipe , pierre , '' said isabel , `` that will be permanent , and save the coals . '' `` it shall not be done , isabel . doth not that pipe and that warmth go into thy room ? shall i rob my wife , good delly , even to benefit my most devoted and true-hearted cousin ? ''
melville	pierre	`` oh ! i should say not , sir ; not at all , '' said delly hysterically . a triumphant fire flashed in isabel 's eye ; her full bosom arched out ; but she was silent . `` she may be here , now , at any moment , isabel , '' said pierre ; `` come , we will meet her in the dining-room ; that is our reception-place , thou knowest . ''
melville	pierre	so the three went into the dining-room . ii . they had not been there long , when pierre , who had been pacing up and down , suddenly paused , as if struck by some laggard thought , which had just occurred to him at the eleventh hour . first he looked toward delly , as if about to bid her quit the apartment , while he should say something private to isabel ; but as if , on a second thought , holding the contrary of this procedure most advisable , he , without preface , at once addressed isabel , in his ordinary conversational tone , so that delly could not but plainly hear him , whether she would or no .
melville	pierre	`` my dear isabel , though , as i said to thee before , my cousin , miss tartan , that strange , and willful , nun-like girl , is at all hazards , mystically resolved to come and live with us , yet it must be quite impossible that her friends can approve in her such a singular step ; a step even more singular , isabel , than thou , in thy unsophisticatedness , can'st at all imagine . i shall be immensely deceived if they do not , to their very utmost , strive against it . now what i am going to add may be quite unnecessary , but i can not avoid speaking it , for all that . ''
melville	pierre	isabel with empty hands sat silent , but intently and expectantly eying him ; while behind her chair , delly was bending her face low over her knitting -- which she had seized so soon as pierre had begun speaking -- and with trembling fingers was nervously twitching the points of her long needles . it was plain that she awaited pierre 's accents with hardly much less eagerness than isabel . marking well this expression in delly , and apparently not unpleased with it , pierre continued ; but by no slightest outward tone or look seemed addressing his remarks to any one but isabel .
melville	pierre	`` now what i mean , dear isabel , is this : if that very probable hostility on the part of miss tartan 's friends to her fulfilling her strange resolution -- if any of that hostility should chance to be manifested under thine eye , then thou certainly wilt know how to account for it ; and as certainly wilt draw no inference from it in the minutest conceivable degree involving any thing sinister in me . no , i am sure thou wilt not , my dearest isabel . for , understand me , regarding this strange mood in my cousin as a thing wholly above my comprehension , and indeed regarding my poor cousin herself as a rapt enthusiast in some wild mystery utterly unknown to me ; and unwilling ignorantly to interfere in what almost seems some supernatural thing , i shall not repulse her coming , however violently her friends may seek to stay it . i shall not repulse , as certainly as i have not invited . but a neutral attitude sometimes seems a suspicious one . now what i mean is this : let all such vague suspicions of me , if any , be confined to lucy 's friends ; but let not such absurd misgivings come near my dearest isabel , to give the least uneasiness . isabel ! tell me ; have i not now said enough to make plain what i mean ? or , indeed , is not all i have said wholly unnecessary ; seeing that when one feels deeply conscientious , one is often apt to seem superfluously , and indeed unpleasantly and unbeseemingly scrupulous ? speak , my own isabel , '' -- and he stept nearer to her , reaching forth his arm .
melville	pierre	`` thy hand is the caster 's ladle , pierre , which holds me entirely fluid . into thy forms and slightest moods of thought , thou pourest me ; and i there solidify to that form , and take it on , and thenceforth wear it , till once more thou moldest me anew . if what thou tellest me be thy thought , then how can i help its being mine , my pierre ? ''
melville	pierre	`` the gods made thee of a holyday , when all the common world was done , and shaped thee leisurely in elaborate hours , thou paragon ! '' so saying , in a burst of admiring love and wonder , pierre paced the room ; while isabel sat silent , leaning on her hand , and half-vailed with her hair . delly 's nervous stitches became less convulsive . she seemed soothed ; some dark and vague conceit seemed driven out of her by something either directly expressed by pierre , or inferred from his expressions .
melville	pierre	iii . `` pierre ! pierre ! -- quick ! quick ! -- they are dragging me back ! -- oh , quick , dear pierre ! '' `` what is that ? '' swiftly cried isabel , rising to her feet , and amazedly glancing toward the door leading into the corridor .
melville	pierre	but pierre darted from the room , prohibiting any one from following him . half-way down the stairs , a slight , airy , almost unearthly figure was clinging to the balluster ; and two young men , one in naval uniform , were vainly seeking to remove the two thin white hands without hurting them . they were glen stanly , and frederic , the elder brother of lucy .
melville	pierre	in a moment , pierre 's hands were among the rest . `` villain ! -- damn thee ! '' cried frederic ; and letting go the hand of his sister , he struck fiercely at pierre . but the blow was intercepted by pierre .
melville	pierre	`` thou hast bewitched , thou damned juggler , the sweetest angel ! defend thyself ! '' `` nay , nay , '' cried glen , catching the drawn rapier of the frantic brother , and holding him in his powerful grasp ; `` he is unarmed ; this is no time or place to settle our feud with him . thy sister , -- sweet lucy -- let us save her first , and then what thou wilt . pierre glendinning -- if thou art but the little finger of a man -- begone with thee from hence ! thy depravity , thy pollutedness , is that of a fiend ! -- thou canst not desire this thing : -- the sweet girl is mad ! ''
melville	pierre	pierre stepped back a little , and looked palely and haggardly at all three . `` i render no accounts : i am what i am . this sweet girl -- this angel whom ye two defile by your touches -- she is of age by the law : -- she is her own mistress by the law . and now , i swear she shall have her will ! unhand the girl ! let her stand alone . see ; she will faint ; let her go , i say ! '' and again his hands were among them .
melville	pierre	suddenly , as they all , for the one instant vaguely struggled , the pale girl drooped , and fell sideways toward pierre ; and , unprepared for this , the two opposite champions , unconsciously relinquished their hold , tripped , and stumbled against each other , and both fell on the stairs . snatching lucy in his arms , pierre darted from them ; gained the door ; drove before him isabel and delly , -- who , affrighted , had been lingering there ; -- and bursting into the prepared chamber , laid lucy on her cot ; then swiftly turned out of the room , and locked them all three in : and so swiftly -- like lightning -- was this whole thing done , that not till the lock clicked , did he find glen and frederic fiercely fronting him .
melville	pierre	`` gentlemen , it is all over . this door is locked . she is in women 's hands. -- stand back ! '' as the two infuriated young men now caught at him to hurl him aside , several of the apostles rapidly entered , having been attracted by the noise .
melville	pierre	`` drag them off from me ! '' cried pierre . `` they are trespassers ! drag them off ! '' immediately glen and frederic were pinioned by twenty hands ; and , in obedience to a sign from pierre , were dragged out of the room , and dragged down stairs ; and given into the custody of a passing officer , as two disorderly youths invading the sanctuary of a private retreat .
melville	pierre	in vain they fiercely expostulated ; but at last , as if now aware that nothing farther could be done without some previous legal action , they most reluctantly and chafingly declared themselves ready to depart . accordingly they were let go ; but not without a terrible menace of swift retribution directed to pierre .
melville	pierre	iv . happy is the dumb man in the hour of passion . he makes no impulsive threats , and therefore seldom falsifies himself in the transition from choler to calm . proceeding into the thoroughfare , after leaving the apostles ' , it was not very long ere glen and frederic concluded between themselves , that lucy could not so easily be rescued by threat or force . the pale , inscrutable determinateness , and flinchless intrepidity of pierre , now began to domineer upon them ; for any social unusualness or greatness is sometimes most impressive in the retrospect . what pierre had said concerning lucy 's being her own mistress in the eye of the law ; this now recurred to them . after much tribulation of thought , the more collected glen proposed , that frederic 's mother should visit the rooms of pierre ; he imagined , that though insensible to their own united intimidations , lucy might not prove deaf to the maternal prayers . had mrs. tartan been a different woman than she was ; had she indeed any disinterested agonies of a generous heart , and not mere match-making mortifications , however poignant ; then the hope of frederic and glen might have had more likelihood in it . nevertheless , the experiment was tried , but signally failed .
melville	pierre	in the combined presence of her mother , pierre , isabel , and delly ; and addressing pierre and isabel as mr. and mrs. glendinning ; lucy took the most solemn vows upon herself , to reside with her present host and hostess until they should cast her off . in vain her by turns suppliant , and exasperated mother went down on her knees to her , or seemed almost on the point of smiting her ; in vain she painted all the scorn and the loathing ; sideways hinted of the handsome and gallant glen ; threatened her that in case she persisted , her entire family would renounce her ; and though she should be starving , would not bestow one morsel upon such a recreant , and infinitely worse than dishonorable girl .
melville	pierre	to all this , lucy -- now entirely unmenaced in person -- replied in the gentlest and most heavenly manner ; yet with a collectedness , and steadfastness , from which there was nothing to hope . what she was doing was not of herself ; she had been moved to it by all-encompassing influences above , around , and beneath . she felt no pain for her own condition ; her only suffering was sympathetic . she looked for no reward ; the essence of well-doing was the consciousness of having done well without the least hope of reward . concerning the loss of worldly wealth and sumptuousness , and all the brocaded applauses of drawing-rooms ; these were no loss to her , for they had always been valueless . nothing was she now renouncing ; but in acting upon her present inspiration she was inheriting every thing . indifferent to scorn , she craved no pity . as to the question of her sanity , that matter she referred to the verdict of angels , and not to the sordid opinions of man . if any one protested that she was defying the sacred counsels of her mother , she had nothing to answer but this : that her mother possessed all her daughterly deference , but her unconditional obedience was elsewhere due . let all hope of moving her be immediately , and once for all , abandoned . one only thing could move her ; and that would only move her , to make her forever immovable ; -- that thing was death .
melville	pierre	such wonderful strength in such wonderful sweetness ; such inflexibility in one so fragile , would have been matter for marvel to any observer . but to her mother it was very much more ; for , like many other superficial observers , forming her previous opinion of lucy upon the slightness of her person , and the dulcetness of her temper , mrs. tartan had always imagined that her daughter was quite incapable of any such daring act . as if sterling heavenliness were incompatible with heroicness . these two are never found apart . nor , though pierre knew more of lucy than any one else , did this most singular behavior in her fail to amaze him . seldom even had the mystery of isabel fascinated him more , with a fascination partaking of the terrible . the mere bodily aspect of lucy , as changed by her more recent life , filled him with the most powerful and novel emotions . that unsullied complexion of bloom was now entirely gone , without being any way replaced by sallowness , as is usual in similar instances . and as if her body indeed were the temple of god , and marble indeed were the only fit material for so holy a shrine , a brilliant , supernatural whiteness now gleamed in her cheek . her head sat on her shoulders as a chiseled statue 's head ; and the soft , firm light in her eye seemed as much a prodigy , as though a chiseled statue should give token of vision and intelligence .
melville	pierre	isabel also was most strangely moved by this sweet unearthliness in the aspect of lucy . but it did not so much persuade her by any common appeals to her heart , as irrespectively commend her by the very signet of heaven . in the deference with which she ministered to lucy 's little occasional wants , there was more of blank spontaneousness than compassionate voluntariness . and when it so chanced , that -- owing perhaps to some momentary jarring of the distant and lonely guitar -- as lucy was so mildly speaking in the presence of her mother , a sudden , just audible , submissively answering musical , stringed tone , came through the open door from the adjoining chamber ; then isabel , as if seized by some spiritual awe , fell on her knees before lucy , and made a rapid gesture of homage ; yet still , somehow , as it were , without evidence of voluntary will .
melville	pierre	finding all her most ardent efforts ineffectual , mrs. tartan now distressedly motioned to pierre and isabel to quit the chamber , that she might urge her entreaties and menaces in private . but lucy gently waved them to stay ; and then turned to her mother . henceforth she had no secrets but those which would also be secrets in heaven . whatever was publicly known in heaven , should be publicly known on earth . there was no slightest secret between her and her mother .
melville	pierre	wholly confounded by this inscrutableness of her so alienated and infatuated daughter , mrs. tartan turned inflamedly upon pierre , and bade him follow her forth . but again lucy said nay , there were no secrets between her mother and pierre . she would anticipate every thing there . calling for pen and paper , and a book to hold on her knee and write , she traced the following lines , and reached them to her mother :
melville	pierre	`` i am lucy tartan . i have come to dwell during their pleasure with mr. and mrs. pierre glendinning , of my own unsolicited free-will . if they desire it , i shall go ; but no other power shall remove me , except by violence ; and against any violence i have the ordinary appeal to the law . ''
melville	pierre	`` read this , madam , '' said mrs. tartan , tremblingly handing it to isabel , and eying her with a passionate and disdainful significance . `` i have read it , '' said isabel , quietly , after a glance , and handing it to pierre , as if by that act to show , that she had no separate decision in the matter .
melville	pierre	`` and do you , sir , too , indirectly connive ? '' said mrs. tartan to pierre , when he had read it . `` i render no accounts , madam . this seems to be the written and final calm will of your daughter . as such , you had best respect it , and depart . ''
melville	pierre	mrs. tartan glanced despairingly and incensedly about her ; then fixing her eyes on her daughter , spoke . `` girl ! here where i stand , i forever cast thee off . never more shalt thou be vexed by my maternal entreaties . i shall instruct thy brothers to disown thee ; i shall instruct glen stanly to banish thy worthless image from his heart , if banished thence it be not already by thine own incredible folly and depravity . for thee , mr. monster ! the judgment of god will overtake thee for this . and for thee , madam , i have no words for the woman who will connivingly permit her own husband 's paramour to dwell beneath her roof . for thee , frail one , '' ( to delly ) , `` thou needest no amplification. -- a nest of vileness ! and now , surely , whom god himself hath abandoned forever , a mother may quit , never more to revisit . ''
melville	pierre	this parting maternal malediction seemed to work no visibly corresponding effect upon lucy ; already she was so marble-white , that fear could no more blanch her , if indeed fear was then at all within her heart . for as the highest , and purest , and thinnest ether remains unvexed by all the tumults of the inferior air ; so that transparent ether of her cheek , that clear mild azure of her eye , showed no sign of passion , as her terrestrial mother stormed below . helpings she had from unstirring arms ; glimpses she caught of aid invisible ; sustained she was by those high powers of immortal love , that once siding with the weakest reed which the utmost tempest tosses ; then that utmost tempest shall be broken down before the irresistible resistings of that weakest reed .
melville	pierre	book xxv . lucy , isabel , and pierre . pierre at his book . enceladus . i . a day or two after the arrival of lucy , when she had quite recovered from any possible ill-effects of recent events , -- events conveying such a shock to both pierre and isabel , -- though to each in a quite different way , -- but not , apparently , at least , moving lucy so intensely -- as they were all three sitting at coffee , lucy expressed her intention to practice her crayon art professionally . it would be so pleasant an employment for her , besides contributing to their common fund . pierre well knew her expertness in catching likenesses , and judiciously and truthfully beautifying them ; not by altering the features so much , as by steeping them in a beautifying atmosphere . for even so , said lucy , thrown into the lagoon , and there beheld -- as i have heard -- the roughest stones , without transformation , put on the softest aspects . if pierre would only take a little trouble to bring sitters to her room , she doubted not a fine harvest of heads might easily be secured . certainly , among the numerous inmates of the old church , pierre must know many who would have no objections to being sketched . moreover , though as yet she had had small opportunity to see them ; yet among such a remarkable company of poets , philosophers , and mystics of all sorts , there must be some striking heads . in conclusion , she expressed her satisfaction at the chamber prepared for her , inasmuch as having been formerly the studio of an artist , one window had been considerably elevated , while by a singular arrangement of the interior shutters , the light could in any direction be thrown about at will .
melville	pierre	already pierre had anticipated something of this sort ; the first sight of the easel having suggested it to him . his reply was therefore not wholly unconsidered . he said , that so far as she herself was concerned , the systematic practice of her art at present would certainly be a great advantage in supplying her with a very delightful occupation . but since she could hardly hope for any patronage from her mother 's fashionable and wealthy associates ; indeed , as such a thing must be very far from her own desires ; and as it was only from the apostles she could -- for some time to come , at least -- reasonably anticipate sitters ; and as those apostles were almost universally a very forlorn and penniless set -- though in truth there were some wonderfully rich-looking heads among them -- therefore , lucy must not look for much immediate pecuniary emolument . ere long she might indeed do something very handsome ; but at the outset , it was well to be moderate in her expectations . this admonishment came , modifiedly , from that certain stoic , dogged mood of pierre , born of his recent life , which taught him never to expect any good from any thing ; but always to anticipate ill ; however not in unreadiness to meet the contrary ; and then , if good came , so much the better . he added that he would that very morning go among the rooms and corridors of the apostles , familiarly announcing that his cousin , a lady-artist in crayons , occupied a room adjoining his , where she would be very happy to receive any sitters .
melville	pierre	`` and now , lucy , what shall be the terms ? that is a very important point , thou knowest . '' `` i suppose , pierre , they must be very low , '' said lucy , looking at him meditatively .
melville	pierre	`` very low , lucy ; very low , indeed . '' `` well , ten dollars , then . '' `` ten banks of england , lucy ! '' exclaimed pierre . `` why , lucy , that were almost a quarter 's income for some of the apostles ! ''
melville	pierre	`` four dollars , pierre . '' `` i will tell thee now , lucy -- but first , how long does it take to complete one portrait ? '' `` two sittings ; and two mornings ' work by myself , pierre . '' `` and let me see ; what are thy materials ? they are not very costly , i believe . 't is not like cutting glass , -- thy tools must not be pointed with diamonds , lucy ? ''
melville	pierre	`` see , pierre ! '' said lucy , holding out her little palm , `` see ; this handful of charcoal , a bit of bread , a crayon or two , and a square of paper : -- that is all . '' `` well , then , thou shalt charge one-seventy-five for a portrait . ''
melville	pierre	`` only one-seventy-five , pierre ? '' `` i am half afraid now we have set it far too high , lucy . thou must not be extravagant . look : if thy terms were ten dollars , and thou didst crayon on trust ; then thou wouldst have plenty of sitters , but small returns . but if thou puttest thy terms right-down , and also sayest thou must have thy cash right-down too -- do n't start so at that _cash_ -- then not so many sitters to be sure , but more returns . thou understandest . ''
melville	pierre	`` it shall be just as thou say'st , pierre . '' `` well , then , i will write a card for thee , stating thy terms ; and put it up conspicuously in thy room , so that every apostle may know what he has to expect . ''
melville	pierre	`` thank thee , thank thee , cousin pierre , '' said lucy , rising . `` i rejoice at thy pleasant and not entirely unhopeful view of my poor little plan . but i must be doing something ; i must be earning money . see , i have eaten ever so much bread this morning , but have not earned one penny . ''
melville	pierre	with a humorous sadness pierre measured the large remainder of the one only piece she had touched , and then would have spoken banteringly to her ; but she had slid away into her own room .
melville	pierre	he was presently roused from the strange revery into which the conclusion of this scene had thrown him , by the touch of isabel 's hand upon his knee , and her large expressive glance upon his face . during all the foregoing colloquy , she had remained entirely silent ; but an unoccupied observer would perhaps have noticed , that some new and very strong emotions were restrainedly stirring within her .
melville	pierre	`` pierre ! '' she said , intently bending over toward him . `` well , well , isabel , '' stammeringly replied pierre ; while a mysterious color suffused itself over his whole face , neck , and brow ; and involuntarily he started a little back from her self-proffering form .
melville	pierre	arrested by this movement isabel eyed him fixedly ; then slowly rose , and with immense mournful stateliness , drew herself up , and said : `` if thy sister can ever come too nigh to thee , pierre , tell thy sister so , beforehand ; for the september sun draws not up the valley-vapor more jealously from the disdainful earth , than my secret god shall draw me up from thee , if ever i can come too nigh to thee . ''
melville	pierre	thus speaking , one hand was on her bosom , as if resolutely feeling of something deadly there concealed ; but , riveted by her general manner more than by her particular gesture , pierre , at the instant , did not so particularly note the all-significant movement of the hand upon her bosom , though afterward he recalled it , and darkly and thoroughly comprehended its meaning .
melville	pierre	`` too nigh to me , isabel ? sun or dew , thou fertilizest me ! can sunbeams or drops of dew come too nigh the thing they warm and water ? then sit down by me , isabel , and sit close ; wind in within my ribs , -- if so thou canst , -- that my one frame may be the continent of two . ''
melville	pierre	`` fine feathers make fine birds , so i have heard , '' said isabel , most bitterly -- '' but do fine sayings always make fine deeds ? pierre , thou didst but just now draw away from me ! ''
melville	pierre	`` when we would most dearly embrace , we first throw back our arms , isabel ; i but drew away , to draw so much the closer to thee . '' `` well ; all words are arrant skirmishers ; deeds are the army 's self ! be it as thou sayest . i yet trust to thee. -- pierre . ''
melville	pierre	`` my breath waits thine ; what is it , isabel ? '' `` i have been more blockish than a block ; i am mad to think of it ! more mad , that her great sweetness should first remind me of mine own stupidity . but she shall not get the start of me ! pierre , some way i must work for thee ! see , i will sell this hair ; have these teeth pulled out ; but some way i will earn money for thee ! ''
melville	pierre	pierre now eyed her startledly . touches of a determinate meaning shone in her ; some hidden thing was deeply wounded in her . an affectionate soothing syllable was on his tongue ; his arm was out ; when shifting his expression , he whisperingly and alarmedly exclaimed -- '' hark ! she is coming. -- be still . ''
melville	pierre	but rising boldly , isabel threw open the connecting door , exclaiming half-hysterically -- '' look , lucy ; here is the strangest husband ; fearful of being caught speaking to his wife ! '' with an artist 's little box before her -- whose rattling , perhaps , had startled pierre -- lucy was sitting midway in her room , opposite the opened door ; so that at that moment , both pierre and isabel were plainly visible to her . the singular tone of isabel 's voice instantly caused her to look up intently . at once , a sudden irradiation of some subtile intelligence -- but whether welcome to her , or otherwise , could not be determined -- shot over her whole aspect . she murmured some vague random reply ; and then bent low over her box , saying she was very busy .
melville	pierre	isabel closed the door , and sat down again by pierre . her countenance wore a mixed and writhing , impatient look . she seemed as one in whom the most powerful emotion of life is caught in inextricable toils of circumstances , and while longing to disengage itself , still knows that all struggles will prove worse than vain ; and so , for the moment , grows madly reckless and defiant of all obstacles . pierre trembled as he gazed upon her . but soon the mood passed from her ; her old , sweet mournfulness returned ; again the clear unfathomableness was in her mystic eye .
melville	pierre	`` pierre , ere now , -- ere i ever knew thee -- i have done mad things , which i have never been conscious of , but in the dim recalling . i hold such things no things of mine . what i now remember , as just now done , was one of them . ''
melville	pierre	`` thou hast done nothing but shown thy strength , while i have shown my weakness , isabel ; -- yes , to the whole world thou art my wife -- to her , too , thou art my wife . have i not told her so , myself ? i was weaker than a kitten , isabel ; and thou , strong as those high things angelical , from which utmost beauty takes not strength . ''
melville	pierre	`` pierre , once such syllables from thee , were all refreshing , and bedewing to me ; now , though they drop as warmly and as fluidly from thee , yet falling through another and an intercepting zone , they freeze on the way , and clatter on my heart like hail , pierre. -- -- thou didst not speak thus to her ! ''
melville	pierre	`` she is not isabel . '' the girl gazed at him with a quick and piercing scrutiny ; then looked quite calm , and spoke . `` my guitar , pierre : thou know'st how complete a mistress i am of it ; now , before thou gettest sitters for the portrait-sketcher , thou shalt get pupils for the music-teacher . wilt thou ? '' and she looked at him with a persuasiveness and touchingness , which to pierre , seemed more than mortal .
melville	pierre	`` my poor poor , isabel ! '' cried pierre ; `` thou art the mistress of the natural sweetness of the guitar , not of its invented regulated artifices ; and these are all that the silly pupil will pay for learning . and what thou hast can not be taught . ah , thy sweet ignorance is all transporting to me ! my sweet , my sweet ! -- dear , divine girl ! '' and impulsively he caught her in his arms .
melville	pierre	while the first fire of his feeling plainly glowed upon him , but ere he had yet caught her to him , isabel had backward glided close to the connecting door ; which , at the instant of his embrace , suddenly opened , as by its own volition .
melville	pierre	before the eyes of seated lucy , pierre and isabel stood locked ; pierre 's lips upon her cheek . ii . notwithstanding the maternal visit of mrs. tartan , and the peremptoriness with which it had been closed by her declared departure never to return , and her vow to teach all lucy 's relatives and friends , and lucy 's own brothers , and her suitor , to disown her , and forget her ; yet pierre fancied that he knew too much in general of the human heart , and too much in particular of the character of both glen and frederic , to remain entirely untouched by disquietude , concerning what those two fiery youths might now be plotting against him , as the imagined monster , by whose infernal tricks lucy tartan was supposed to have been seduced from every earthly seemliness . not happily , but only so much the more gloomily , did he augur from the fact , that mrs. tartan had come to lucy unattended ; and that glen and frederic had let eight-and-forty hours and more go by , without giving the slightest hostile or neutral sign . at first he thought , that bridling their impulsive fierceness , they were resolved to take the slower , but perhaps the surer method , to wrest lucy back to them , by instituting some legal process . but this idea was repulsed by more than one consideration .
melville	pierre	not only was frederic of that sort of temper , peculiar to military men , which would prompt him , in so closely personal and intensely private and family a matter , to scorn the hireling publicity of the law 's lingering arm ; and impel him , as by the furiousness of fire , to be his own righter and avenger ; for , in him , it was perhaps quite as much the feeling of an outrageous family affront to himself , through lucy , as her own presumed separate wrong , however black , which stung him to the quick : not only were these things so respecting frederic ; but concerning glen , pierre well knew , that be glen heartless as he might , to do a deed of love , glen was not heartless to do a deed of hate ; that though , on that memorable night of his arrival in the city , glen had heartlessly closed his door upon him , yet now glen might heartfully burst pierre 's open , if by that he at all believed , that permanent success would crown the fray .
melville	pierre	besides , pierre knew this ; -- that so invincible is the natural , untamable , latent spirit of a courageous manliness in man , that though now socially educated for thousands of years in an arbitrary homage to the law , as the one only appointed redress for every injured person ; yet immemorially and universally , among all gentlemen of spirit , once to have uttered independent personal threats of personal vengeance against your foe , and then , after that , to fall back slinking into a court , and hire with sops a pack of yelping pettifoggers to fight the battle so valiantly proclaimed ; this , on the surface , is ever deemed very decorous , and very prudent -- a most wise second thought ; but , at bottom , a miserably ignoble thing . frederic was not the watery man for that , -- glen had more grapey blood in him .
melville	pierre	moreover , it seemed quite clear to pierre , that only by making out lucy absolutely mad , and striving to prove it by a thousand despicable little particulars , could the law succeed in tearing her from the refuge she had voluntarily sought ; a course equally abhorrent to all the parties possibly to be concerned on either side .
melville	pierre	what then would those two boiling bloods do ? perhaps they would patrol the streets ; and at the first glimpse of lonely lucy , kidnap her home . or if pierre were with her , then , smite him down by hook or crook , fair play or foul ; and then , away with lucy ! or if lucy systematically kept her room , then fall on pierre in the most public way , fell him , and cover him from all decent recognition beneath heaps on heaps of hate and insult ; so that broken on the wheel of such dishonor , pierre might feel himself unstrung , and basely yield the prize .
melville	pierre	not the gibbering of ghosts in any old haunted house ; no sulphurous and portentous sign at night beheld in heaven , will so make the hair to stand , as when a proud and honorable man is revolving in his soul the possibilities of some gross public and corporeal disgrace . it is not fear ; it is a pride-horror , which is more terrible than any fear . then , by tremendous imagery , the murderer 's mark of cain is felt burning on the brow , and the already acquitted knife blood-rusts in the clutch of the anticipating hand .
melville	pierre	certain that those two youths must be plotting something furious against him ; with the echoes of their scorning curses on the stairs still ringing in his ears -- curses , whose swift responses from himself , he , at the time , had had much ado to check ; -- thoroughly alive to the supernaturalism of that mad frothing hate which a spirited brother forks forth at the insulter of a sister 's honor -- beyond doubt the most uncompromising of all the social passions known to man -- and not blind to the anomalous fact , that if such a brother stab his foe at his own mother 's table , all people and all juries would bear him out , accounting every thing allowable to a noble soul made mad by a sweet sister 's shame caused by a damned seducer ; -- imagining to himself his own feelings , if he were actually in the position which frederic so vividly fancied to be his ; remembering that in love matters jealousy is as an adder , and that the jealousy of glen was double-addered by the extraordinary malice of the apparent circumstances under which lucy had spurned glen 's arms , and fled to his always successful and now married rival , as if wantonly and shamelessly to nestle there ; -- remembering all these intense incitements of both those foes of his , pierre could not but look forward to wild work very soon to come . nor was the storm of passion in his soul unratified by the decision of his coolest possible hour . storm and calm both said to him , -- look to thyself , oh pierre !
melville	pierre	murders are done by maniacs ; but the earnest thoughts of murder , these are the collected desperadoes . pierre was such ; fate , or what you will , had made him such . but such he was . and when these things now swam before him ; when he thought of all the ambiguities which hemmed him in ; the stony walls all round that he could not overleap ; the million aggravations of his most malicious lot ; the last lingering hope of happiness licked up from him as by flames of fire , and his one only prospect a black , bottomless gulf of guilt , upon whose verge he imminently teetered every hour ; -- then the utmost hate of glen and frederic were jubilantly welcome to him ; and murder , done in the act of warding off their ignominious public blow , seemed the one only congenial sequel to such a desperate career .
melville	pierre	iii . as a statue , planted on a revolving pedestal , shows now this limb , now that ; now front , now back , now side ; continually changing , too , its general profile ; so does the pivoted , statued soul of man , when turned by the hand of truth . lies only never vary ; look for no invariableness in pierre . nor does any canting showman here stand by to announce his phases as he revolves . catch his phases as your insight may .
melville	pierre	another day passed on ; glen and frederic still absenting themselves , and pierre and isabel and lucy all dwelling together . the domestic presence of lucy had begun to produce a remarkable effect upon pierre . sometimes , to the covertly watchful eye of isabel , he would seem to look upon lucy with an expression illy befitting their singular and so-supposed merely cousinly relation ; and yet again , with another expression still more unaccountable to her , -- one of fear and awe , not unmixed with impatience . but his general detailed manner toward lucy was that of the most delicate and affectionate considerateness -- nothing more . he was never alone with her ; though , as before , at times alone with isabel .
melville	pierre	lucy seemed entirely undesirous of usurping any place about him ; manifested no slightest unwelcome curiosity as to pierre , and no painful embarrassment as to isabel . nevertheless , more and more did she seem , hour by hour , to be somehow inexplicably sliding between them , without touching them . pierre felt that some strange heavenly influence was near him , to keep him from some uttermost harm ; isabel was alive to some untraceable displacing agency . though when all three were together , the marvelous serenity , and sweetness , and utter unsuspectingness of lucy obviated any thing like a common embarrassment : yet if there was any embarrassment at all beneath that roof , it was sometimes when pierre was alone with isabel , after lucy would innocently quit them .
melville	pierre	meantime pierre was still going on with his book ; every moment becoming still the more sensible of the intensely inauspicious circumstances of all sorts under which that labor was proceeding . and as the now advancing and concentring enterprise demanded more and more compacted vigor from him , he felt that he was having less and less to bring to it . for not only was it the signal misery of pierre , to be invisibly -- though but accidentally -- goaded , in the hour of mental immaturity , to the attempt at a mature work , -- a circumstance sufficiently lamentable in itself ; but also , in the hour of his clamorous pennilessness , he was additionally goaded into an enterprise long and protracted in the execution , and of all things least calculated for pecuniary profit in the end . how these things were so , whence they originated , might be thoroughly and very beneficially explained ; but space and time here forbid .
melville	pierre	at length , domestic matters -- rent and bread -- had come to such a pass with him , that whether or no , the first pages must go to the printer ; and thus was added still another tribulation ; because the printed pages now dictated to the following manuscript , and said to all subsequent thoughts and inventions of pierre -- _thus and thus_ ; _so and so_ ; _else an ill match_ . therefore , was his book already limited , bound over , and committed to imperfection , even before it had come to any confirmed form or conclusion at all . oh , who shall reveal the horrors of poverty in authorship that is high ? while the silly millthorpe was railing against his delay of a few weeks and months ; how bitterly did unreplying pierre feel in his heart , that to most of the great works of humanity , their authors had given , not weeks and months , not years and years , but their wholly surrendered and dedicated lives . on either hand clung to by a girl who would have laid down her life for him ; pierre , nevertheless , in his deepest , highest part , was utterly without sympathy from any thing divine , human , brute , or vegetable . one in a city of hundreds of thousands of human beings , pierre was solitary as at the pole .
melville	pierre	and the great woe of all was this : that all these things were unsuspected without , and undivulgible from within ; the very daggers that stabbed him were joked at by imbecility , ignorance , blockheadedness , self-complacency , and the universal blearedness and besottedness around him . now he began to feel that in him , the thews of a titan were forestallingly cut by the scissors of fate . he felt as a moose , hamstrung . all things that think , or move , or lie still , seemed as created to mock and torment him . he seemed gifted with loftiness , merely that it might be dragged down to the mud . still , the profound willfulness in him would not give up . against the breaking heart , and the bursting head ; against all the dismal lassitude , and deathful faintness and sleeplessness , and whirlingness , and craziness , still he like a demigod bore up . his soul 's ship foresaw the inevitable rocks , but resolved to sail on , and make a courageous wreck . now he gave jeer for jeer , and taunted the apes that jibed him . with the soul of an atheist , he wrote down the godliest things ; with the feeling of misery and death in him , he created forms of gladness and life . for the pangs in his heart , he put down hoots on the paper . and every thing else he disguised under the so conveniently adjustable drapery of all-stretchable philosophy . for the more and the more that he wrote , and the deeper and the deeper that he dived , pierre saw the everlasting elusiveness of truth ; the universal lurking insincerity of even the greatest and purest written thoughts . like knavish cards , the leaves of all great books were covertly packed . he was but packing one set the more ; and that a very poor jaded set and pack indeed . so that there was nothing he more spurned , than his own aspirations ; nothing he more abhorred than the loftiest part of himself . the brightest success , now seemed intolerable to him , since he so plainly saw , that the brightest success could not be the sole offspring of merit ; but of merit for the one thousandth part , and nine hundred and ninety-nine combining and dove-tailing accidents for the rest . so beforehand he despised those laurels which in the very nature of things , can never be impartially bestowed . but while thus all the earth was depopulated of ambition for him ; still circumstances had put him in the attitude of an eager contender for renown . so beforehand he felt the unrevealable sting of receiving either plaudits or censures , equally unsought for , and equally loathed ere given . so , beforehand he felt the pyramidical scorn of the genuine loftiness for the whole infinite company of infinitesimal critics . his was the scorn which thinks it not worth the while to be scornful . those he most scorned , never knew it . in that lonely little closet of his , pierre foretasted all that this world hath either of praise or dispraise ; and thus foretasting both goblets , anticipatingly hurled them both in its teeth . all panegyric , all denunciation , all criticism of any sort , would come too late for pierre .
melville	pierre	but man does never give himself up thus , a doorless and shutterless house for the four loosened winds of heaven to howl through , without still additional dilapidations . much oftener than before , pierre laid back in his chair with the deadly feeling of faintness . much oftener than before , came staggering home from his evening walk , and from sheer bodily exhaustion economized the breath that answered the anxious inquiries as to what might be done for him . and as if all the leagued spiritual inveteracies and malices , combined with his general bodily exhaustion , were not enough , a special corporeal affliction now descended like a sky-hawk upon him . his incessant application told upon his eyes . they became so affected , that some days he wrote with the lids nearly closed , fearful of opening them wide to the light . through the lashes he peered upon the paper , which so seemed fretted with wires . sometimes he blindly wrote with his eyes turned away from the paper ; -- thus unconsciously symbolizing the hostile necessity and distaste , the former whereof made of him this most unwilling states-prisoner of letters .
melville	pierre	as every evening , after his day 's writing was done , the proofs of the beginning of his work came home for correction , isabel would read them to him . they were replete with errors ; but preoccupied by the thronging , and undiluted , pure imaginings of things , he became impatient of such minute , gnat-like torments ; he randomly corrected the worst , and let the rest go ; jeering with himself at the rich harvest thus furnished to the entomological critics .
melville	pierre	but at last he received a tremendous interior intimation , to hold off -- to be still from his unnatural struggle . in the earlier progress of his book , he had found some relief in making his regular evening walk through the greatest thoroughfare of the city ; that so , the utter isolation of his soul , might feel itself the more intensely from the incessant jogglings of his body against the bodies of the hurrying thousands . then he began to be sensible of more fancying stormy nights , than pleasant ones ; for then , the great thoroughfares were less thronged , and the innumerable shop-awnings flapped and beat like schooners ' broad sails in a gale , and the shutters banged like lashed bulwarks ; and the slates fell hurtling like displaced ship 's blocks from aloft . stemming such tempests through the deserted streets , pierre felt a dark , triumphant joy ; that while others had crawled in fear to their kennels , he alone defied the storm-admiral , whose most vindictive peltings of hail-stones , -- striking his iron-framed fiery furnace of a body , -- melted into soft dew , and so , harmlessly trickled from off him .
melville	pierre	by-and-by , of such howling , pelting nights , he began to bend his steps down the dark , narrow side-streets , in quest of the more secluded and mysterious tap-rooms . there he would feel a singular satisfaction , in sitting down all dripping in a chair , ordering his half-pint of ale before him , and drawing over his cap to protect his eyes from the light , eye the varied faces of the social castaways , who here had their haunts from the bitterest midnights .
melville	pierre	but at last he began to feel a distaste for even these ; and now nothing but the utter night-desolation of the obscurest warehousing lanes would content him , or be at all sufferable to him . among these he had now been accustomed to wind in and out every evening ; till one night as he paused a moment previous to turning about for home , a sudden , unwonted , and all-pervading sensation seized him . he knew not where he was ; he did not have any ordinary life-feeling at all . he could not see ; though instinctively putting his hand to his eyes , he seemed to feel that the lids were open . then he was sensible of a combined blindness , and vertigo , and staggering ; before his eyes a million green meteors danced ; he felt his foot tottering upon the curb , he put out his hands , and knew no more for the time . when he came to himself he found that he was lying crosswise in the gutter , dabbled with mud and slime . he raised himself to try if he could stand ; but the fit was entirely gone . immediately he quickened his steps homeward , forbearing to rest or pause at all on the way , lest that rush of blood to his head , consequent upon his sudden cessation from walking , should again smite him down . this circumstance warned him away from those desolate streets , lest the repetition of the fit should leave him there to perish by night in unknown and unsuspected loneliness . but if that terrible vertigo had been also intended for another and deeper warning , he regarded such added warning not at all ; but again plied heart and brain as before .
melville	pierre	but now at last since the very blood in his body had in vain rebelled against his titanic soul ; now the only visible outward symbols of that soul -- his eyes -- did also turn downright traitors to him , and with more success than the rebellious blood . he had abused them so recklessly , that now they absolutely refused to look on paper . he turned them on paper , and they blinked and shut . the pupils of his eyes rolled away from him in their own orbits . he put his hand up to them , and sat back in his seat . then , without saying one word , he continued there for his usual term , suspended , motionless , blank .
melville	pierre	but next morning -- it was some few days after the arrival of lucy -- still feeling that a certain downright infatuation , and no less , is both unavoidable and indispensable in the composition of any great , deep book , or even any wholly unsuccessful attempt at any great , deep book ; next morning he returned to the charge . but again the pupils of his eyes rolled away from him in their orbits : and now a general and nameless torpor -- some horrible foretaste of death itself -- seemed stealing upon him .
melville	pierre	iv . during this state of semi-unconsciousness , or rather trance , a remarkable dream or vision came to him . the actual artificial objects around him slid from him , and were replaced by a baseless yet most imposing spectacle of natural scenery . but though a baseless vision in itself , this airy spectacle assumed very familiar features to pierre . it was the phantasmagoria of the mount of the titans , a singular height standing quite detached in a wide solitude not far from the grand range of dark blue hills encircling his ancestral manor .
melville	pierre	say what some poets will , nature is not so much her own ever-sweet interpreter , as the mere supplier of that cunning alphabet , whereby selecting and combining as he pleases , each man reads his own peculiar lesson according to his own peculiar mind and mood . thus a high-aspiring , but most moody , disappointed bard , chancing once to visit the meadows and beholding that fine eminence , christened it by the name it ever after bore ; completely extinguishing its former title -- the delectable mountain -- one long ago bestowed by an old baptist farmer , an hereditary admirer of bunyan and his most marvelous book . from the spell of that name the mountain never afterward escaped ; for now , gazing upon it by the light of those suggestive syllables , no poetical observer could resist the apparent felicity of the title . for as if indeed the immemorial mount would fain adapt itself to its so recent name , some people said that it had insensibly changed its pervading aspect within a score or two of winters . nor was this strange conceit entirely without foundation , seeing that the annual displacements of huge rocks and gigantic trees were continually modifying its whole front and general contour .
melville	pierre	on the north side , where it fronted the old manor-house , some fifteen miles distant , the height , viewed from the piazza of a soft haze-canopied summer 's noon , presented a long and beautiful , but not entirely inaccessible-looking purple precipice , some two thousand feet in air , and on each hand sideways sloping down to lofty terraces of pastures .
melville	pierre	those hill-side pastures , be it said , were thickly sown with a small white amaranthine flower , which , being irreconcilably distasteful to the cattle , and wholly rejected by them , and yet , continually multiplying on every hand , did by no means contribute to the agricultural value of those elevated lands . insomuch , that for this cause , the disheartened dairy tenants of that part of the manor , had petitioned their lady-landlord for some abatement in their annual tribute of upland grasses , in the juny-load ; rolls of butter in the october crock ; and steers and heifers on the october hoof ; with turkeys in the christmas sleigh .
melville	pierre	`` the small white flower , it is our bane ! '' the imploring tenants cried . `` the aspiring amaranth , every year it climbs and adds new terraces to its sway ! the immortal amaranth , it will not die , but last year 's flowers survive to this ! the terraced pastures grow glittering white , and in warm june still show like banks of snow : -- fit token of the sterileness the amaranth begets ! then free us from the amaranth , good lady , or be pleased to abate our rent ! ''
melville	pierre	now , on a somewhat nearer approach , the precipice did not belie its purple promise from the manorial piazza -- that sweet imposing purple promise , which seemed fully to vindicate the bunyanish old title originally bestowed ; -- but showed the profuse aerial foliage of a hanging forest . nevertheless , coming still more nigh , long and frequent rents among the mass of leaves revealed horrible glimpses of dark-dripping rocks , and mysterious mouths of wolfish caves . struck by this most unanticipated view , the tourist now quickened his impulsive steps to verify the change by coming into direct contact with so chameleon a height . as he would now speed on , the lower ground , which from the manor-house piazza seemed all a grassy level , suddenly merged into a very long and weary acclivity , slowly rising close up to the precipice 's base ; so that the efflorescent grasses rippled against it , as the efflorescent waves of some great swell or long rolling billow ripple against the water-line of a steep gigantic war-ship on the sea . and , as among the rolling sea-like sands of egypt , disordered rows of broken sphinxes lead to the cheopian pyramid itself ; so this long acclivity was thickly strewn with enormous rocky masses , grotesque in shape , and with wonderful features on them , which seemed to express that slumbering intelligence visible in some recumbent beasts -- beasts whose intelligence seems struck dumb in them by some sorrowful and inexplicable spell . nevertheless , round and round those still enchanted rocks , hard by their utmost rims , and in among their cunning crevices , the misanthropic hill-scaling goat nibbled his sweetest food ; for the rocks , so barren in themselves , distilled a subtile moisture , which fed with greenness all things that grew about their igneous marge .
melville	pierre	quitting those recumbent rocks , you still ascended toward the hanging forest , and piercing within its lowermost fringe , then suddenly you stood transfixed , as a marching soldier confounded at the sight of an impregnable redoubt , where he had fancied it a practicable vault to his courageous thews . cunningly masked hitherto , by the green tapestry of the interlacing leaves , a terrific towering palisade of dark mossy massiness confronted you ; and , trickling with unevaporable moisture , distilled upon you from its beetling brow slow thunder-showers of water-drops , chill as the last dews of death . now you stood and shivered in that twilight , though it were high noon and burning august down the meads . all round and round , the grim scarred rocks rallied and re-rallied themselves ; shot up , protruded , stretched , swelled , and eagerly reached forth ; on every side bristlingly radiating with a hideous repellingness . tossed , and piled , and indiscriminate among these , like bridging rifts of logs up-jammed in alluvial-rushing streams of far arkansas : or , like great masts and yards of overwhelmed fleets hurled high and dashed amain , all splintering together , on hovering ridges of the atlantic sea , -- you saw the melancholy trophies which the north wind , championing the unquenchable quarrel of the winter , had wrested from the forests , and dismembered them on their own chosen battle-ground , in barbarous disdain . 'mid this spectacle of wide and wanton spoil , insular noises of falling rocks would boomingly explode upon the silence and fright all the echoes , which ran shrieking in and out among the caves , as wailing women and children in some assaulted town .
melville	pierre	stark desolation ; ruin , merciless and ceaseless ; chills and gloom , -- all here lived a hidden life , curtained by that cunning purpleness , which , from the piazza of the manor house , so beautifully invested the mountain once called delectable , but now styled titanic .
melville	pierre	beaten off by such undreamed-of glooms and steeps , you now sadly retraced your steps , and , mayhap , went skirting the inferior sideway terraces of pastures ; where the multiple and most sterile inodorous immortalness of the small , white flower furnished no aliment for the mild cow 's meditative cud . but here and there you still might smell from far the sweet aromaticness of clumps of catnip , that dear farm-house herb . soon you would see the modest verdure of the plant itself ; and wheresoever you saw that sight , old foundation stones and rotting timbers of log-houses long extinct would also meet your eye ; their desolation illy hid by the green solicitudes of the unemigrating herb . most fitly named the catnip ; since , like the unrunagate cat , though all that 's human forsake the place , that plant will long abide , long bask and bloom on the abandoned hearth . illy hid ; for every spring the amaranthine and celestial flower gained on the mortal household herb ; for every autumn the catnip died , but never an autumn made the amaranth to wane . the catnip and the amaranth ! -- man 's earthly household peace , and the ever-encroaching appetite for god .
melville	pierre	no more now you sideways followed the sad pasture 's skirt , but took your way adown the long declivity , fronting the mystic height . in mid field again you paused among the recumbent sphinx-like shapes thrown off from the rocky steep . you paused ; fixed by a form defiant , a form of awfulness . you saw enceladus the titan , the most potent of all the giants , writhing from out the imprisoning earth ; -- turbaned with upborn moss he writhed ; still , though armless , resisting with his whole striving trunk , the pelion and the ossa hurled back at him ; -- turbaned with upborn moss he writhed ; still turning his unconquerable front toward that majestic mount eternally in vain assailed by him , and which , when it had stormed him off , had heaved his undoffable incubus upon him , and deridingly left him there to bay out his ineffectual howl .
melville	pierre	to pierre this wondrous shape had always been a thing of interest , though hitherto all its latent significance had never fully and intelligibly smitten him . in his earlier boyhood a strolling company of young collegian pedestrians had chanced to light upon the rock ; and , struck with its remarkableness , had brought a score of picks and spades , and dug round it to unearth it , and find whether indeed it were a demoniac freak of nature , or some stern thing of antediluvian art . accompanying this eager party , pierre first beheld that deathless son of terra . at that time , in its untouched natural state , the statue presented nothing but the turbaned head of igneous rock rising from out the soil , with its unabasable face turned upward toward the mountain , and the bull-like neck clearly defined . with distorted features , scarred and broken , and a black brow mocked by the upborn moss , enceladus there subterraneously stood , fast frozen into the earth at the junction of the neck . spades and picks soon heaved part of his ossa from him , till at last a circular well was opened round him to the depth of some thirteen feet . at that point the wearied young collegians gave over their enterprise in despair . with all their toil , they had not yet come to the girdle of enceladus . but they had bared good part of his mighty chest , and exposed his mutilated shoulders , and the stumps of his once audacious arms . thus far uncovering his shame , in that cruel plight they had abandoned him , leaving stark naked his in vain indignant chest to the defilements of the birds , which for untold ages had cast their foulness on his vanquished crest .
melville	pierre	not unworthy to be compared with that leaden titan , wherewith the art of marsy and the broad-flung pride of bourbon enriched the enchanted gardens of versailles ; -- and from whose still twisted mouth for sixty feet the waters yet upgush , in elemental rivalry with those etna flames , of old asserted to be the malicious breath of the borne-down giant ; -- not unworthy to be compared with that leaden demi-god -- piled with costly rocks , and with one bent wrenching knee protruding from the broken bronze ; -- not unworthy to be compared with that bold trophy of high art , this american enceladus , wrought by the vigorous hand of nature 's self , it did go further than compare ; -- it did far surpass that fine figure molded by the inferior skill of man . marsy gave arms to the eternally defenseless ; but nature , more truthful , performed an amputation , and left the impotent titan without one serviceable ball-and-socket above the thigh .
melville	pierre	such was the wild scenery -- the mount of titans , and the repulsed group of heaven-assaulters , with enceladus in their midst shamefully recumbent at its base ; -- such was the wild scenery , which now to pierre , in his strange vision , displaced the four blank walls , the desk , and camp-bed , and domineered upon his trance . but no longer petrified in all their ignominious attitudes , the herded titans now sprung to their feet ; flung themselves up the slope ; and anew battered at the precipice 's unresounding wall . foremost among them all , he saw a moss-turbaned , armless giant , who despairing of any other mode of wreaking his immitigable hate , turned his vast trunk into a battering-ram , and hurled his own arched-out ribs again and yet again against the invulnerable steep .
melville	pierre	`` enceladus ! it is enceladus ! '' -- pierre cried out in his sleep . that moment the phantom faced him ; and pierre saw enceladus no more ; but on the titan 's armless trunk , his own duplicate face and features magnifiedly gleamed upon him with prophetic discomfiture and woe . with trembling frame he started from his chair , and woke from that ideal horror to all his actual grief .
melville	pierre	v. nor did pierre 's random knowledge of the ancient fables fail still further to elucidate the vision which so strangely had supplied a tongue to muteness . but that elucidation was most repulsively fateful and foreboding ; possibly because pierre did not leap the final barrier of gloom ; possibly because pierre did not willfully wrest some final comfort from the fable ; did not flog this stubborn rock as moses his , and force even aridity itself to quench his painful thirst .
melville	pierre	thus smitten , the mount of titans seems to yield this following stream : -- old titan 's self was the son of incestuous coelus and terra , the son of incestuous heaven and earth . and titan married his mother terra , another and accumulatively incestuous match . and thereof enceladus was one issue . so enceladus was both the son and grandson of an incest ; and even thus , there had been born from the organic blended heavenliness and earthliness of pierre , another mixed , uncertain , heaven-aspiring , but still not wholly earth-emancipated mood ; which again , by its terrestrial taint held down to its terrestrial mother , generated there the present doubly incestuous enceladus within him ; so that the present mood of pierre -- that reckless sky-assaulting mood of his , was nevertheless on one side the grandson of the sky . for it is according to eternal fitness , that the precipitated titan should still seek to regain his paternal birthright even by fierce escalade . wherefore whoso storms the sky gives best proof he came from thither ! but whatso crawls contented in the moat before that crystal fort , shows it was born within that slime , and there forever will abide .
melville	pierre	recovered somewhat from the after-spell of this wild vision folded in his trance , pierre composed his front as best he might , and straightway left his fatal closet . concentrating all the remaining stuff in him , he resolved by an entire and violent change , and by a willful act against his own most habitual inclinations , to wrestle with the strange malady of his eyes , this new death-fiend of the trance , and this inferno of his titanic vision .
melville	pierre	and now , just as he crossed the threshold of the closet , he writhingly strove to assume an expression intended to be not uncheerful -- though how indeed his countenance at all looked , he could not tell ; for dreading some insupportably dark revealments in his glass , he had of late wholly abstained from appealing to it -- and in his mind he rapidly conned over , what indifferent , disguising , or light-hearted gamesome things he should say , when proposing to his companions the little design he cherished .
melville	pierre	and even so , to grim enceladus , the world the gods had chained for a ball to drag at his o'erfreighted feet ; -- even so that globe put forth a thousand flowers , whose fragile smiles disguised his ponderous load .
melville	pierre	book xxvi . a walk : a foreign portrait : a sail : and the end . i . `` come , isabel , come , lucy ; we have not had a single walk together yet . it is cold , but clear ; and once out of the city , we shall find it sunny . come : get ready now , and away for a stroll down to the wharf , and then for some of the steamers on the bay . no doubt , lucy , you will find in the bay scenery some hints for that secret sketch you are so busily occupied with -- ere real living sitters do come -- and which you so devotedly work at , all alone and behind closed doors . ''
melville	pierre	upon this , lucy 's original look of pale-rippling pleasantness and surprise -- evoked by pierre 's unforeseen proposition to give himself some relaxation -- changed into one of infinite , mute , but unrenderable meaning , while her swimming eyes gently , yet all-bewildered , fell to the floor .
melville	pierre	`` it is finished , then , '' cried isabel , -- not unmindful of this by-scene , and passionately stepping forward so as to intercept pierre 's momentary rapt glance at the agitated lucy , -- '' that vile book , it is finished ! -- thank heaven ! ''
melville	pierre	`` not so , '' said pierre ; and , displacing all disguisements , a hectic unsummoned expression suddenly came to his face ; -- '' but ere that vile book be finished , i must get on some other element than earth . i have sat on earth 's saddle till i am weary ; i must now vault over to the other saddle awhile . oh , seems to me , there should be two ceaseless steeds for a bold man to ride , -- the land and the sea ; and like circus-men we should never dismount , but only be steadied and rested by leaping from one to the other , while still , side by side , they both race round the sun . i have been on the land steed so long , oh i am dizzy ! ''
melville	pierre	`` thou wilt never listen to me , pierre , '' said lucy lowly ; `` there is no need of this incessant straining . see , isabel and i have both offered to be thy amanuenses ; -- not in mere copying , but in the original writing ; i am sure that would greatly assist thee . ''
melville	pierre	`` impossible ! i fight a duel in which all seconds are forbid . '' `` ah pierre ! pierre ! '' cried lucy , dropping the shawl in her hand , and gazing at him with unspeakable longings of some unfathomable emotion .
melville	pierre	namelessly glancing at lucy , isabel slid near to him , seized his hand and spoke . `` i would go blind for thee , pierre ; here , take out these eyes , and use them for glasses . '' so saying , she looked with a strange momentary haughtiness and defiance at lucy .
melville	pierre	a general half involuntary movement was now made , as if they were about to depart . `` ye are ready ; go ye before '' -- said lucy meekly ; `` i will follow . '' `` nay , one on each arm '' -- said pierre -- '' come ! ''
melville	pierre	as they passed through the low arched vestibule into the street , a cheek-burnt , gamesome sailor passing , exclaimed -- '' steer small , my lad ; 't is a narrow strait thou art in ! '' `` what says he ? '' -- said lucy gently . `` yes , it is a narrow strait of a street indeed . ''
melville	pierre	but pierre felt a sudden tremble transferred to him from isabel , who whispered something inarticulate in his ear . gaining one of the thoroughfares , they drew near to a conspicuous placard over a door , announcing that above stairs was a gallery of paintings , recently imported from europe , and now on free exhibition preparatory to their sale by auction . though this encounter had been entirely unforeseen by pierre , yet yielding to the sudden impulse , he at once proposed their visiting the pictures . the girls assented , and they ascended the stairs .
melville	pierre	in the anteroom , a catalogue was put into his hand . he paused to give one hurried , comprehensive glance at it . among long columns of such names as rubens , raphael , angelo , domenichino , da vinci , all shamelessly prefaced with the words `` undoubted , '' or `` testified , '' pierre met the following brief line : -- '' _no . 99 . a stranger 's head , by an unknown hand._ ''
melville	pierre	it seemed plain that the whole must be a collection of those wretched imported daubs , which with the incredible effrontery peculiar to some of the foreign picture-dealers in america , were christened by the loftiest names known to art . but as the most mutilated torsoes of the perfections of antiquity are not unworthy the student 's attention , neither are the most bungling modern incompletenesses : for both are torsoes ; one of perished perfections in the past ; the other , by anticipation , of yet unfulfilled perfections in the future . still , as pierre walked along by the thickly hung walls , and seemed to detect the infatuated vanity which must have prompted many of these utterly unknown artists in the attempted execution by feeble hand of vigorous themes ; he could not repress the most melancholy foreboding concerning himself . all the walls of the world seemed thickly hung with the empty and impotent scope of pictures , grandly outlined , but miserably filled . the smaller and humbler pictures , representing little familiar things , were by far the best executed ; but these , though touching him not unpleasingly , in one restricted sense , awoke no dormant majesties in his soul , and therefore , upon the whole , were contemptibly inadequate and unsatisfactory .
melville	pierre	at last pierre and isabel came to that painting of which pierre was capriciously in search -- no . 99 . `` my god ! see ! see ! '' cried isabel , under strong excitement , `` only my mirror has ever shown me that look before ! see ! see ! ''
melville	pierre	by some mere hocus-pocus of chance , or subtly designing knavery , a real italian gem of art had found its way into this most hybrid collection of impostures . no one who has passed through the great galleries of europe , unbewildered by their wonderful multitudinousness of surpassing excellence -- a redundancy which neutralizes all discrimination or individualizing capacity in most ordinary minds -- no calm , penetrative person can have victoriously run that painted gauntlet of the gods , without certain very special emotions , called forth by some one or more individual paintings , to which , however , both the catalogues and the criticisms of the greatest connoisseurs deny any all-transcending merit , at all answering to the effect thus casually produced . there is no time now to show fully how this is ; suffice it , that in such instances , it is not the abstract excellence always , but often the accidental congeniality , which occasions this wonderful emotion . still , the individual himself is apt to impute it to a different cause ; hence , the headlong enthusiastic admiration of some one or two men for things not at all praised by -- or at most , which are indifferent to -- the rest of the world ; -- a matter so often considered inexplicable .
melville	pierre	but in this stranger 's head by the unknown hand , the abstract general excellence united with the all-surprising , accidental congeniality in producing an accumulated impression of power upon both pierre and isabel . nor was the strangeness of this at all impaired by the apparent uninterestedness of lucy concerning that very picture . indeed , lucy -- who , owing to the occasional jolting of the crowd , had loosened her arm from pierre 's , and so , gradually , had gone on along the pictured hall in advance -- lucy had thus passed the strange painting , without the least special pause , and had now wandered round to the precisely opposite side of the hall ; where , at this present time , she was standing motionless before a very tolerable copy ( the only other good thing in the collection ) of that sweetest , most touching , but most awful of all feminine heads -- the cenci of guido . the wonderfulness of which head consists chiefly , perhaps , in a striking , suggested contrast , half-identical with , and half-analogous to , that almost supernatural one -- sometimes visible in the maidens of tropical nations -- namely , soft and light blue eyes , with an extremely fair complexion ; vailed by funereally jetty hair . but with blue eyes and fair complexion , the cenci 's hair is golden -- physically , therefore , all is in strict , natural keeping ; which , nevertheless , still the more intensifies the suggested fanciful anomaly of so sweetly and seraphically _blonde_ a being , being double-hooded , as it were , by the black crape of the two most horrible crimes ( of one of which she is the object , and of the other the agent ) possible to civilized humanity -- incest and parricide .
melville	pierre	now , this cenci and `` the stranger '' were hung at a good elevation in one of the upper tiers ; and , from the opposite walls , exactly faced each other ; so that in secret they seemed pantomimically talking over and across the heads of the living spectators below .
melville	pierre	with the aspect of the cenci every one is familiar . `` the stranger '' was a dark , comely , youthful man 's head , portentously looking out of a dark , shaded ground , and ambiguously smiling . there was no discoverable drapery ; the dark head , with its crisp , curly , jetty hair , seemed just disentangling itself from out of curtains and clouds . but to isabel , in the eye and on the brow , were certain shadowy traces of her own unmistakable likeness ; while to pierre , this face was in part as the resurrection of the one he had burnt at the inn . not that the separate features were the same ; but the pervading look of it , the subtler interior keeping of the entirety , was almost identical ; still , for all this , there was an unequivocal aspect of foreignness , of europeanism , about both the face itself and the general painting .
melville	pierre	`` is it ? is it ? can it be ? '' whispered isabel , intensely . now , isabel knew nothing of the painting which pierre had destroyed . but she solely referred to the living being who -- under the designation of her father -- had visited her at the cheerful house to which she had been removed during childhood from the large and unnamable one by the pleasant woman in the coach . without doubt -- though indeed she might not have been at all conscious of it in her own mystic mind -- she must have somehow vaguely fancied , that this being had always through life worn the same aspect to every body else which he had to her , for so very brief an interval of his possible existence . solely knowing him -- or dreaming of him , it may have been -- under that one aspect , she could not conceive of him under any other . whether or not these considerations touching isabel 's ideas occurred to pierre at this moment is very improbable . at any rate , he said nothing to her , either to deceive or undeceive , either to enlighten or obscure . for , indeed , he was too much riveted by his own far-interior emotions to analyze now the cotemporary ones of isabel . so that there here came to pass a not unremarkable thing : for though both were intensely excited by one object , yet their two minds and memories were thereby directed to entirely different contemplations ; while still each , for the time -- however unreasonably -- might have vaguely supposed the other occupied by one and the same contemplation . pierre was thinking of the chair-portrait : isabel , of the living face . yet isabel 's fervid exclamations having reference to the living face , were now , as it were , mechanically responded to by pierre , in syllables having reference to the chair-portrait . nevertheless , so subtile and spontaneous was it all , that neither perhaps ever afterward discovered this contradiction ; for , events whirled them so rapidly and peremptorily after this , that they had no time for those calm retrospective reveries indispensable perhaps to such a discovery .
melville	pierre	`` is it ? is it ? can it be ? '' was the intense whisper of isabel . `` no , it can not be , it is not , '' replied pierre ; `` one of the wonderful coincidences , nothing more . ''
melville	pierre	`` oh , by that word , pierre , we but vainly seek to explain the inexplicable . tell me : it is ! it must be ! it is wonderful ! '' `` let us begone ; and let us keep eternal silence , '' said pierre , quickly ; and , seeking lucy , they abruptly left the place ; as before , pierre , seemingly unwilling to be accosted by any one he knew , or who knew his companions , unconsciously accelerating their steps while forced for a space to tread the thoroughfares .
melville	pierre	ii . as they hurried on , pierre was silent ; but wild thoughts were hurrying and shouting in his heart . the most tremendous displacing and revolutionizing thoughts were upheaving in him , with reference to isabel ; nor -- though at the time he was hardly conscious of such a thing -- were these thoughts wholly unwelcome to him .
melville	pierre	how did he know that isabel was his sister ? setting aside aunt dorothea 's nebulous legend , to which , in some shadowy points , here and there isabel 's still more nebulous story seemed to fit on , -- though but uncertainly enough -- and both of which thus blurredly conjoining narrations , regarded in the unscrupulous light of real naked reason , were any thing but legitimately conclusive ; and setting aside his own dim reminiscences of his wandering father 's death-bed ; ( for though , in one point of view , those reminiscences might have afforded some degree of presumption as to his father 's having been the parent of an unacknowledged daughter , yet were they entirely inconclusive as to that presumed daughter 's identity ; and the grand point now with pierre was , not the general question whether his father had had a daughter , but whether , assuming that he had had , _isabel_ , rather than any other living being , _was that daughter_ ; ) -- and setting aside all his own manifold and inter-enfolding mystic and transcendental persuasions , -- originally born , as he now seemed to feel , purely of an intense procreative enthusiasm : -- an enthusiasm no longer so all-potential with him as of yore ; setting all these aside , and coming to the plain , palpable facts , -- how did he _know_ that isabel was his sister ? nothing that he saw in her face could he remember as having seen in his father 's . the chair-portrait , _that_ was the entire sum and substance of all possible , rakable , downright presumptive evidence , which peculiarly appealed to his own separate self . yet here was another portrait of a complete stranger -- a european ; a portrait imported from across the seas , and to be sold at public auction , which was just as strong an evidence as the other . then , the original of this second portrait was as much the father of isabel as the original of the chair-portrait . but perhaps there was no original at all to this second portrait ; it might have been a pure fancy piece ; to which conceit , indeed , the uncharacterizing style of the filling-up seemed to furnish no small testimony .
melville	pierre	with such bewildering meditations as these in him , running up like clasping waves upon the strand of the most latent secrecies of his soul , and with both isabel and lucy bodily touching his sides as he walked ; the feelings of pierre were entirely untranslatable into any words that can be used .
melville	pierre	of late to pierre , much more vividly than ever before , the whole story of isabel had seemed an enigma , a mystery , an imaginative delirium ; especially since he had got so deep into the inventional mysteries of his book . for he who is most practically and deeply conversant with mysticisms and mysteries ; he who professionally deals in mysticisms and mysteries himself ; often that man , more than any body else , is disposed to regard such things in others as very deceptively bejuggling ; and likewise is apt to be rather materialistic in all his own merely personal notions ( as in their practical lives , with priests of eleusinian religions ) , and more than any other man , is often inclined , at the bottom of his soul , to be uncompromisingly skeptical on all novel visionary hypotheses of any kind . it is only the no-mystics , or the half-mystics , who , properly speaking , are credulous . so that in pierre , was presented the apparent anomaly of a mind , which by becoming really profound in itself , grew skeptical of all tendered profundities ; whereas , the contrary is generally supposed .
melville	pierre	by some strange arts isabel 's wonderful story might have been , someway , and for some cause , forged for her , in her childhood , and craftily impressed upon her youthful mind ; which so -- like a slight mark in a young tree -- had now enlargingly grown with her growth , till it had become this immense staring marvel . tested by any thing real , practical , and reasonable , what less probable , for instance , than that fancied crossing of the sea in her childhood , when upon pierre 's subsequent questioning of her , she did not even know that the sea was salt .
melville	pierre	iii . in the midst of all these mental confusions they arrived at the wharf ; and selecting the most inviting of the various boats which lay about them in three or four adjacent ferry-slips , and one which was bound for a half-hour 's sail across the wide beauty of that glorious bay ; they soon found themselves afloat and in swift gliding motion .
melville	pierre	they stood leaning on the rail of the guard , as the sharp craft darted out from among the lofty pine-forests of ships'-masts , and the tangled underbrush and cane-brakes of the dwarfed sticks of sloops and scows . soon , the spires of stone on the land , blent with the masts of wood on the water ; the crotch of the twin-rivers pressed the great wedged city almost out of sight . they swept by two little islets distant from the shore ; they wholly curved away from the domes of free-stone and marble , and gained the great sublime dome of the bay 's wide-open waters .
melville	pierre	small breeze had been felt in the pent city that day , but the fair breeze of naked nature now blew in their faces . the waves began to gather and roll ; and just as they gained a point , where -- still beyond -- between high promontories of fortresses , the wide bay visibly sluiced into the atlantic , isabel convulsively grasped the arm of pierre and convulsively spoke .
melville	pierre	`` i feel it ! i feel it ! it is ! it is ! '' `` what feelest thou ? -- what is it ? '' `` the motion ! the motion ! '' `` dost thou not understand , pierre ? '' said lucy , eying with concern and wonder his pale , staring aspect -- '' the waves : it is the motion of the waves that isabel speaks of . look , they are rolling , direct from the sea now . ''
melville	pierre	again pierre lapsed into a still stranger silence and revery . it was impossible altogether to resist the force of this striking corroboration of by far the most surprising and improbable thing in the whole surprising and improbable story of isabel . well did he remember her vague reminiscence of the teetering sea , that did not slope exactly as the floors of the unknown , abandoned , old house among the french-like mountains .
melville	pierre	while plunged in these mutually neutralizing thoughts of the strange picture and the last exclamations of isabel , the boat arrived at its destination -- a little hamlet on the beach , not very far from the great blue sluice-way into the ocean , which was now yet more distinctly visible than before .
melville	pierre	`` do n't let us stop here '' -- cried isabel . `` look , let us go through there ! bell must go through there ! see ! see ! out there upon the blue ! yonder , yonder ! far away -- out , out ! -- far , far away , and away , and away , out there ! where the two blues meet , and are nothing -- bell must go ! ''
melville	pierre	`` why , isabel , '' murmured lucy , `` that would be to go to far england or france ; thou wouldst find but few friends in far france , isabel . '' `` friends in far france ? and what friends have i here ? -- art thou my friend ? in thy secret heart dost thou wish me well ? and for thee , pierre , what am i but a vile clog to thee ; dragging thee back from all thy felicity ? yes , i will go yonder -- yonder ; out there ! i will , i will ! unhand me ! let me plunge ! ''
melville	pierre	for an instant , lucy looked incoherently from one to the other . but both she and pierre now mechanically again seized isabel 's frantic arms , as they were again thrown over the outer rail of the boat . they dragged her back ; they spoke to her ; they soothed her ; but though less vehement , isabel still looked deeply distrustfully at lucy , and deeply reproachfully at pierre .
melville	pierre	they did not leave the boat as intended ; too glad were they all , when it unloosed from its fastenings , and turned about upon the backward trip . stepping to shore , pierre once more hurried his companions through the unavoidable publicity of the thoroughfares ; but less rapidly proceeded , soon as they gained the more secluded streets .
melville	pierre	iv . gaining the apostles ' , and leaving his two companions to the privacy of their chambers , pierre sat silent and intent by the stove in the dining-room for a time , and then was on the point of entering his closet from the corridor , when delly , suddenly following him , said to him , that she had forgotten to mention it before , but he would find two letters in his room , which had been separately left at the door during the absence of the party .
melville	pierre	he passed into the closet , and slowly shooting the bolt -- which , for want of something better , happened to be an old blunted dagger -- walked , with his cap yet unmoved , slowly up to the table , and beheld the letters . they were lying with their sealed sides up ; one in either hand , he lifted them ; and held them straight out sideways from him .
melville	pierre	`` i see not the writing ; know not yet , by mine own eye , that they are meant for me ; yet , in these hands i feel that i now hold the final poniards that shall stab me ; and by stabbing me , make _me_ too a most swift stabber in the recoil . which point first ? -- this ! ''
melville	pierre	he tore open the left-hand letter : -- `` sir : -- you are a swindler . upon the pretense of writing a popular novel for us , you have been receiving cash advances from us , while passing through our press the sheets of a blasphemous rhapsody , filched from the vile atheists , lucian and voltaire . our great press of publication has hitherto prevented our slightest inspection of our reader 's proofs of your book . send not another sheet to us . our bill for printing thus far , and also for our cash advances , swindled out of us by you , is now in the hands of our lawyer , who is instructed to proceed with instant rigor .
melville	pierre	( _signed_ ) steel , flint & asbestos . '' he folded the left-hand letter , and put it beneath his left heel , and stood upon it so ; and then opened the right-hand letter .
melville	pierre	`` thou , pierre glendinning , art a villainous and perjured liar . it is the sole object of this letter imprintedly to convey the point blank lie to thee ; that taken in at thy heart , it may be thence pulsed with thy blood , throughout thy system . we have let some interval pass inactive , to confirm and solidify our hate . separately , and together , we brand thee , in thy every lung-cell , a liar ; -- liar , because that is the scornfullest and loathsomest title for a man ; which in itself is the compend of all infamous things .
melville	pierre	( _signed_ ) glendinning stanly , frederic tartan . '' he folded the right-hand letter , and put it beneath his right heel ; then folding his two arms , stood upon both the letters .
melville	pierre	`` these are most small circumstances ; but happening just now to me , become indices to all immensities . for now am i hate-shod ! on these i will skate to my acquittal ! no longer do i hold terms with aught . world 's bread of life , and world 's breath of honor , both are snatched from me ; but i defy all world 's bread and breath . here i step out before the drawn-up worlds in widest space , and challenge one and all of them to battle ! oh , glen ! oh , fred ! most fraternally do i leap to your rib-crushing hugs ! oh , how i love ye two , that yet can make me lively hate , in a world which elsewise only merits stagnant scorn ! -- now , then , where is this swindler 's , this coiner 's book ? here , on this vile counter , over which the coiner thought to pass it to the world , here will i nail it fast , for a detected cheat ! and thus nailed fast now , do i spit upon it , and so get the start of the wise world 's worst abuse of it ! now i go out to meet my fate , walking toward me in the street . ''
melville	pierre	as with hat on , and glen and frederic 's letter invisibly crumpled in his hand , he -- as it were somnambulously -- passed into the room of isabel , she gave loose to a thin , long shriek , at his wondrous white and haggard plight ; and then , without the power to stir toward him , sat petrified in her chair , as one embalmed and glazed with icy varnish .
melville	pierre	he heeded her not , but passed straight on through both intervening rooms , and without a knock unpremeditatedly entered lucy 's chamber . he would have passed out of that , also , into the corridor , without one word ; but something stayed him .
melville	pierre	the marble girl sat before her easel ; a small box of pointed charcoal , and some pencils by her side ; her painter 's wand held out against the frame ; the charcoal-pencil suspended in two fingers , while with the same hand , holding a crust of bread , she was lightly brushing the portrait-paper , to efface some ill-considered stroke . the floor was scattered with the bread-crumbs and charcoal-dust ; he looked behind the easel , and saw his own portrait , in the skeleton .
melville	pierre	at the first glimpse of him , lucy started not , nor stirred ; but as if her own wand had there enchanted her , sat tranced . `` dead embers of departed fires lie by thee , thou pale girl ; with dead embers thou seekest to relume the flame of all extinguished love ! waste not so that bread ; eat it -- in bitterness ! ''
melville	pierre	he turned , and entered the corridor , and then , with outstretched arms , paused between the two outer doors of isabel and lucy . `` for ye two , my most undiluted prayer is now , that from your here unseen and frozen chairs ye may never stir alive ; -- the fool of truth , the fool of virtue , the fool of fate , now quits ye forever ! ''
melville	pierre	as he now sped down the long winding passage , some one eagerly hailed him from a stair . `` what , what , my boy ? where now in such a squally hurry ? hallo , i say ! ''
melville	pierre	but without heeding him at all , pierre drove on . millthorpe looked anxiously and alarmedly after him a moment , then made a movement in pursuit , but paused again . `` there was ever a black vein in this glendinning ; and now that vein is swelled , as if it were just one peg above a tourniquet drawn over-tight . i scarce durst dog him now ; yet my heart misgives me that i should. -- shall i go to his rooms and ask what black thing this is that hath befallen him ? -- no ; not yet ; -- might be thought officious -- they say i 'm given to that . i 'll wait ; something may turn up soon . i 'll into the front street , and saunter some ; and then -- we 'll see . ''
melville	pierre	v. pierre passed on to a remote quarter of the building , and abruptly entered the room of one of the apostles whom he knew . there was no one in it . he hesitated an instant ; then walked up to a book-case , with a chest of drawers in the lower part .
melville	pierre	`` here i saw him put them : -- this , -- no -- here -- ay -- we 'll try this . '' wrenching open the locked drawer , a brace of pistols , a powder flask , a bullet-bag , and a round green box of percussion-caps lay before him .
melville	pierre	`` ha ! what wondrous tools prometheus used , who knows ? but more wondrous these , that in an instant , can unmake the topmost three-score-years-and-ten of all prometheus ' makings . come : here 's two tubes that 'll outroar the thousand pipes of harlem. -- is the music in 'em ? -- no ? -- well then , here 's powder for the shrill treble ; and wadding for the tenor ; and a lead bullet for the concluding bass ! and , -- and , -- and , -- ay ; for the top-wadding , i 'll send 'em back their lie , and plant it scorching in their brains ! ''
melville	pierre	he tore off that part of glen and fred 's letter , which more particularly gave the lie ; and halving it , rammed it home upon the bullets . he thrust a pistol into either breast of his coat ; and taking the rearward passages , went down into the back street ; directing his rapid steps toward the grand central thoroughfare of the city .
melville	pierre	it was a cold , but clear , quiet , and slantingly sunny day ; it was between four and five of the afternoon ; that hour , when the great glaring avenue was most thronged with haughty-rolling carriages , and proud-rustling promenaders , both men and women . but these last were mostly confined to the one wide pavement to the west ; the other pavement was well nigh deserted , save by porters , waiters , and parcel-carriers of the shops . on the west pave , up and down , for three long miles , two streams of glossy , shawled , or broadcloth life unceasingly brushed by each other , as long , resplendent , drooping trains of rival peacocks brush .
melville	pierre	mixing with neither of these , pierre stalked midway between . from his wild and fatal aspect , one way the people took the wall , the other way they took the curb . unentangledly pierre threaded all their host , though in its inmost heart . bent he was , on a straightforward , mathematical intent . his eyes were all about him as he went ; especially he glanced over to the deserted pavement opposite ; for that emptiness did not deceive him ; he himself had often walked that side , the better to scan the pouring throng upon the other .
melville	pierre	just as he gained a large , open , triangular space , built round with the stateliest public erections ; -- the very proscenium of the town ; -- he saw glen and fred advancing , in the distance , on the other side . he continued on ; and soon he saw them crossing over to him obliquely , so as to take him face-and-face . he continued on ; when suddenly running ahead of fred , who now chafingly stood still ( because fred would not make two , in the direct personal assault upon one ) and shouting `` liar ! villain ! '' glen leaped toward pierre from front , and with such lightning-like ferocity , that the simultaneous blow of his cowhide smote pierre across the cheek , and left a half-livid and half-bloody brand .
melville	pierre	for that one moment , the people fell back on all sides from them ; and left them -- momentarily recoiled from each other -- in a ring of panics . but clapping both hands to his two breasts , pierre , on both sides shaking off the sudden white grasp of two rushing girls , tore out both pistols , and rushed headlong upon glen .
melville	pierre	`` for thy one blow , take here two deaths ! 't is speechless sweet to murder thee ! '' spatterings of his own kindred blood were upon the pavement ; his own hand had extinguished his house in slaughtering the only unoutlawed human being by the name of glendinning ; -- and pierre was seized by a hundred contending hands .
melville	pierre	vi . that sundown , pierre stood solitary in a low dungeon of the city prison . the cumbersome stone ceiling almost rested on his brow ; so that the long tiers of massive cell-galleries above seemed partly piled on him . his immortal , immovable , bleached cheek was dry ; but the stone cheeks of the walls were trickling . the pent twilight of the contracted yard , coming through the barred arrow-slit , fell in dim bars upon the granite floor .
melville	pierre	`` here , then , is the untimely , timely end ; -- life 's last chapter well stitched into the middle ! nor book , nor author of the book , hath any sequel , though each hath its last lettering ! -- it is ambiguous still . had i been heartless now , disowned , and spurningly portioned off the girl at saddle meadows , then had i been happy through a long life on earth , and perchance through a long eternity in heaven ! now , 't is merely hell in both worlds . well , be it hell . i will mold a trumpet of the flames , and , with my breath of flame , breathe back my defiance ! but give me first another body ! i long and long to die , to be rid of this dishonored cheek . _hung by the neck till thou be dead._ -- not if i forestall you , though ! -- oh now to live is death , and now to die is life ; now , to my soul , were a sword my midwife ! -- hark ! -- the hangman ? -- who comes ? ''
melville	pierre	`` thy wife and cousin -- so they say ; -- hope they may be ; they may stay till twelve ; '' wheezingly answered a turnkey , pushing the tottering girls into the cell , and locking the door upon them .
melville	pierre	`` ye two pale ghosts , were this the other world , ye were not welcome . away ! -- good angel and bad angel both ! -- for pierre is neuter now ! '' `` oh , ye stony roofs , and seven-fold stony skies ! -- not thou art the murderer , but thy sister hath murdered thee , my brother , oh my brother ! ''
melville	pierre	at these wailed words from isabel , lucy shrunk up like a scroll , and noiselessly fell at the feet of pierre . he touched her heart. -- '' dead ! -- girl ! wife or sister , saint or fiend ! '' -- seizing isabel in his grasp -- '' in thy breasts , life for infants lodgeth not , but death-milk for thee and me ! -- the drug ! '' and tearing her bosom loose , he seized the secret vial nesting there .
melville	pierre	vii . at night the squat-framed , asthmatic turnkey tramped the dim-lit iron gallery before one of the long honey-combed rows of cells . `` mighty still there , in that hole , them two mice i let in ; -- humph ! ''
melville	pierre	suddenly , at the further end of the gallery , he discerned a shadowy figure emerging from the archway there , and running on before an officer , and impetuously approaching where the turnkey stood .
melville	pierre	`` more relations coming . these wind-broken chaps are always in before the second death , seeing they always miss the first. -- humph ! what a froth the fellow 's in ? -- wheezes worse than me ! '' `` where is she ? '' cried fred tartan , fiercely , to him ; `` she 's not at the murderer 's rooms ! i sought the sweet girl there , instant upon the blow ; but the lone dumb thing i found there only wrung her speechless hands and pointed to the door ; -- both birds were flown ! where is she , turnkey ? i 've searched all lengths and breadths but this . hath any angel swept adown and lighted in your granite hell ? ''
melville	pierre	`` broken his wind , and broken loose , too , aint he ? '' wheezed the turnkey to the officer who now came up . `` this gentleman seeks a young lady , his sister , someway innocently connected with the prisoner last brought in . have any females been here to see him ? ''
melville	pierre	`` oh , ay , -- two of 'em in there now ; '' jerking his stumped thumb behind him . fred darted toward the designated cell . `` oh , easy , easy , young gentleman '' -- jingling at his huge bunch of keys -- '' easy , easy , till i get the picks -- i 'm housewife here. -- hallo , here comes another . ''
melville	pierre	hurrying through the same archway toward them , there now rapidly advanced a second impetuous figure , running on in advance of a second officer . `` where is the cell ? '' demanded millthorpe . `` he seeks an interview with the last prisoner , '' explained the second officer .
melville	pierre	`` kill 'em both with one stone , then , '' wheezed the turnkey , gratingly throwing open the door of the cell . `` there 's his pretty parlor , gentlemen ; step in . reg'lar mouse-hole , ar n't it ? -- might hear a rabbit burrow on the world 's t'other side ; -- are they all 'sleep ? ''
melville	pierre	`` i stumble ! '' cried fred , from within ; `` lucy ! a light ! a light ! -- lucy ! '' and he wildly groped about the cell , and blindly caught millthorpe , who was also wildly groping . `` blister me not ! take off thy bloody touch ! -- ho , ho , the light ! -- lucy ! lucy ! -- she 's fainted ! ''
melville	pierre	then both stumbled again , and fell from each other in the cell : and for a moment all seemed still , as though all breaths were held . as the light was now thrust in , fred was seen on the floor holding his sister in his arms ; and millthorpe kneeling by the side of pierre , the unresponsive hand in his ; while isabel , feebly moving , reclined between , against the wall .
melville	pierre	`` yes ! yes ! -- dead ! dead ! dead ! -- without one visible wound -- her sweet plumage hides it. -- thou hellish carrion , this is thy hellish work ! thy juggler 's rifle brought down this heavenly bird ! oh , my god , my god ! thou scalpest me with this sight ! ''
melville	pierre	`` the dark vein 's burst , and here 's the deluge-wreck -- all stranded here ! ah , pierre ! my old companion , pierre ; -- school-mate -- play-mate -- friend ! -- our sweet boy 's walks within the woods ! -- oh , i would have rallied thee , and banteringly warned thee from thy too moody ways , but thou wouldst never heed ! what scornful innocence rests on thy lips , my friend ! -- hand scorched with murderer 's powder , yet how woman-soft ! -- by heaven , these fingers move ! -- one speechless clasp ! -- all 's o'er ! ''
melville	pierre	`` all 's o'er , and ye know him not ! '' came gasping from the wall ; and from the fingers of isabel dropped an empty vial -- as it had been a run-out sand-glass -- and shivered upon the floor ; and her whole form sloped sideways , and she fell upon pierre 's heart , and her long hair ran over him , and arbored him in ebon vines .

shakespeare	hamlet	marcellus . good now , sit down , and tell me , he that knows , why this same strict and most observant watch so nightly toils the subject of the land , and why such daily cast of brazen cannon and foreign mart for implements of war ; why such impress of shipwrights , whose sore task does not divide the sunday from the week . what might be toward , that this sweaty haste doth make the night joint-labourer with the day : who is ’ t that can inform me ?
shakespeare	hamlet	horatio . that can i ; at least , the whisper goes so . our last king , whose image even but now appear ’ d to us , was , as you know , by fortinbras of norway , thereto prick ’ d on by a most emulate pride , dar ’ d to the combat ; in which our valiant hamlet , for so this side of our known world esteem ’ d him , did slay this fortinbras ; who by a seal ’ d compact , well ratified by law and heraldry , did forfeit , with his life , all those his lands which he stood seiz ’ d of , to the conqueror ; against the which , a moiety competent was gaged by our king ; which had return ’ d to the inheritance of fortinbras , had he been vanquisher ; as by the same cov ’ nant and carriage of the article design ’ d , his fell to hamlet . now , sir , young fortinbras , of unimproved mettle , hot and full , hath in the skirts of norway , here and there , shark ’ d up a list of lawless resolutes , for food and diet , to some enterprise that hath a stomach in ’ t ; which is no other , as it doth well appear unto our state , but to recover of us by strong hand and terms compulsatory , those foresaid lands so by his father lost . and this , i take it , is the main motive of our preparations , the source of this our watch , and the chief head of this post-haste and rummage in the land .
shakespeare	hamlet	barnardo . i think it be no other but e ’ en so : well may it sort that this portentous figure comes armed through our watch so like the king that was and is the question of these wars .
shakespeare	hamlet	horatio . a mote it is to trouble the mind ’ s eye . in the most high and palmy state of rome , a little ere the mightiest julius fell , the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the roman streets ; as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood , disasters in the sun ; and the moist star , upon whose influence neptune ’ s empire stands , was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse . and even the like precurse of fierce events , as harbingers preceding still the fates and prologue to the omen coming on , have heaven and earth together demonstrated unto our climatures and countrymen .

shakespeare	hamlet	marcellus . ’ tis gone ! we do it wrong , being so majestical , to offer it the show of violence , for it is as the air , invulnerable , and our vain blows malicious mockery .
shakespeare	hamlet	barnardo . it was about to speak , when the cock crew . horatio . and then it started , like a guilty thing upon a fearful summons . i have heard the cock , that is the trumpet to the morn , doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat awake the god of day ; and at his warning , whether in sea or fire , in earth or air , th ’ extravagant and erring spirit hies to his confine . and of the truth herein this present object made probation .
shakespeare	hamlet	marcellus . it faded on the crowing of the cock . some say that ever ’ gainst that season comes wherein our saviour ’ s birth is celebrated , the bird of dawning singeth all night long ; and then , they say , no spirit dare stir abroad , the nights are wholesome , then no planets strike , no fairy takes , nor witch hath power to charm ; so hallow ’ d and so gracious is the time .
shakespeare	hamlet	horatio . so have i heard , and do in part believe it . but look , the morn in russet mantle clad , walks o ’ er the dew of yon high eastward hill . break we our watch up , and by my advice , let us impart what we have seen tonight unto young hamlet ; for upon my life , this spirit , dumb to us , will speak to him . do you consent we shall acquaint him with it , as needful in our loves , fitting our duty ?

shakespeare	hamlet	cornelius and voltemand . in that , and all things , will we show our duty . king . we doubt it nothing : heartily farewell . [ _exeunt voltemand and cornelius._ ] and now , laertes , what ’ s the news with you ? you told us of some suit . what is ’ t , laertes ? you can not speak of reason to the dane , and lose your voice . what wouldst thou beg , laertes , that shall not be my offer , not thy asking ? the head is not more native to the heart , the hand more instrumental to the mouth , than is the throne of denmark to thy father . what wouldst thou have , laertes ?
shakespeare	hamlet	laertes . dread my lord , your leave and favour to return to france , from whence though willingly i came to denmark to show my duty in your coronation ; yet now i must confess , that duty done , my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france , and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon .
shakespeare	hamlet	king . have you your father ’ s leave ? what says polonius ? polonius . he hath , my lord , wrung from me my slow leave by laboursome petition ; and at last upon his will i seal ’ d my hard consent . i do beseech you give him leave to go .
shakespeare	hamlet	king . take thy fair hour , laertes ; time be thine , and thy best graces spend it at thy will ! but now , my cousin hamlet , and my son— hamlet . [ _aside._ ] a little more than kin , and less than kind .
shakespeare	hamlet	king . how is it that the clouds still hang on you ? hamlet . not so , my lord , i am too much i ’ the sun . queen . good hamlet , cast thy nighted colour off , and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark . do not for ever with thy vailed lids seek for thy noble father in the dust . thou know ’ st ’ tis common , all that lives must die , passing through nature to eternity .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . ay , madam , it is common . queen . if it be , why seems it so particular with thee ? hamlet . seems , madam ! nay , it is ; i know not seems . ’ tis not alone my inky cloak , good mother , nor customary suits of solemn black , nor windy suspiration of forc ’ d breath , no , nor the fruitful river in the eye , nor the dejected haviour of the visage , together with all forms , moods , shows of grief , that can denote me truly . these indeed seem , for they are actions that a man might play ; but i have that within which passeth show ; these but the trappings and the suits of woe .
shakespeare	hamlet	king . ’ tis sweet and commendable in your nature , hamlet , to give these mourning duties to your father ; but you must know , your father lost a father , that father lost , lost his , and the survivor bound in filial obligation , for some term to do obsequious sorrow . but to persevere in obstinate condolement is a course of impious stubbornness . ’ tis unmanly grief , it shows a will most incorrect to heaven , a heart unfortified , a mind impatient , an understanding simple and unschool ’ d ; for what we know must be , and is as common as any the most vulgar thing to sense , why should we in our peevish opposition take it to heart ? fie , ’ tis a fault to heaven , a fault against the dead , a fault to nature , to reason most absurd , whose common theme is death of fathers , and who still hath cried , from the first corse till he that died today , ‘ this must be so. ’ we pray you throw to earth this unprevailing woe , and think of us as of a father ; for let the world take note you are the most immediate to our throne , and with no less nobility of love than that which dearest father bears his son do i impart toward you . for your intent in going back to school in wittenberg , it is most retrograde to our desire : and we beseech you bend you to remain here in the cheer and comfort of our eye , our chiefest courtier , cousin , and our son .
shakespeare	hamlet	queen . let not thy mother lose her prayers , hamlet . i pray thee stay with us ; go not to wittenberg . hamlet . i shall in all my best obey you , madam . king . why , ’ tis a loving and a fair reply . be as ourself in denmark . madam , come ; this gentle and unforc ’ d accord of hamlet sits smiling to my heart ; in grace whereof , no jocund health that denmark drinks today but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell , and the king ’ s rouse the heaven shall bruit again , re-speaking earthly thunder . come away .

shakespeare	hamlet	horatio . a truant disposition , good my lord . hamlet . i would not hear your enemy say so ; nor shall you do my ear that violence , to make it truster of your own report against yourself . i know you are no truant . but what is your affair in elsinore ? we ’ ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart .

shakespeare	hamlet	horatio . my lord , i think i saw him yesternight . hamlet . saw ? who ? horatio . my lord , the king your father . hamlet . the king my father ! horatio . season your admiration for a while with an attent ear , till i may deliver upon the witness of these gentlemen this marvel to you .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . for god ’ s love let me hear . horatio . two nights together had these gentlemen , marcellus and barnardo , on their watch in the dead waste and middle of the night , been thus encounter ’ d . a figure like your father , armed at point exactly , cap-à-pie , appears before them , and with solemn march goes slow and stately by them : thrice he walk ’ d by their oppress ’ d and fear-surprised eyes , within his truncheon ’ s length ; whilst they , distill ’ d almost to jelly with the act of fear , stand dumb , and speak not to him . this to me in dreadful secrecy impart they did , and i with them the third night kept the watch , where , as they had deliver ’ d , both in time , form of the thing , each word made true and good , the apparition comes . i knew your father ; these hands are not more like .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . but where was this ? marcellus . my lord , upon the platform where we watch . hamlet . did you not speak to it ? horatio . my lord , i did ; but answer made it none : yet once methought it lifted up it head , and did address itself to motion , like as it would speak . but even then the morning cock crew loud , and at the sound it shrunk in haste away , and vanish ’ d from our sight .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . ’ tis very strange . horatio . as i do live , my honour ’ d lord , ’ tis true ; and we did think it writ down in our duty to let you know of it .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . indeed , indeed , sirs , but this troubles me . hold you the watch tonight ? mar . and barnardo . we do , my lord . hamlet . arm ’ d , say you ? both . arm ’ d , my lord . hamlet . from top to toe ?
shakespeare	hamlet	both . my lord , from head to foot . hamlet . then saw you not his face ? horatio . o yes , my lord , he wore his beaver up . hamlet . what , look ’ d he frowningly ? horatio . a countenance more in sorrow than in anger .

[ _exeunt horatio , marcellus and barnardo._ ] my father ’ s spirit in arms ! all is not well ; i doubt some foul play : would the night were come ! till then sit still , my soul : foul deeds will rise , though all the earth o ’ erwhelm them , to men ’ s eyes .
shakespeare	hamlet	[ _exit._ ] scene iii . a room in polonius ’ s house . enter laertes and ophelia . laertes . my necessaries are embark ’ d . farewell . and , sister , as the winds give benefit and convoy is assistant , do not sleep , but let me hear from you .
shakespeare	hamlet	ophelia . do you doubt that ? laertes . for hamlet , and the trifling of his favour , hold it a fashion and a toy in blood ; a violet in the youth of primy nature , forward , not permanent , sweet , not lasting ; the perfume and suppliance of a minute ; no more .
shakespeare	hamlet	ophelia . no more but so ? laertes . think it no more . for nature crescent does not grow alone in thews and bulk ; but as this temple waxes , the inward service of the mind and soul grows wide withal . perhaps he loves you now , and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch the virtue of his will ; but you must fear , his greatness weigh ’ d , his will is not his own ; for he himself is subject to his birth : he may not , as unvalu ’ d persons do , carve for himself ; for on his choice depends the sanctity and health of this whole state ; and therefore must his choice be circumscrib ’ d unto the voice and yielding of that body whereof he is the head . then if he says he loves you , it fits your wisdom so far to believe it as he in his particular act and place may give his saying deed ; which is no further than the main voice of denmark goes withal . then weigh what loss your honour may sustain if with too credent ear you list his songs , or lose your heart , or your chaste treasure open to his unmaster ’ d importunity . fear it , ophelia , fear it , my dear sister ; and keep you in the rear of your affection , out of the shot and danger of desire . the chariest maid is prodigal enough if she unmask her beauty to the moon . virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes : the canker galls the infants of the spring too oft before their buttons be disclos ’ d , and in the morn and liquid dew of youth contagious blastments are most imminent . be wary then , best safety lies in fear . youth to itself rebels , though none else near .
shakespeare	hamlet	ophelia . i shall th ’ effect of this good lesson keep as watchman to my heart . but good my brother , do not as some ungracious pastors do , show me the steep and thorny way to heaven ; whilst like a puff ’ d and reckless libertine himself the primrose path of dalliance treads , and recks not his own rede .
shakespeare	hamlet	laertes . o , fear me not . i stay too long . but here my father comes . enter polonius . a double blessing is a double grace ; occasion smiles upon a second leave . polonius . yet here , laertes ? aboard , aboard , for shame . the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail , and you are stay ’ d for . there , my blessing with you .
shakespeare	hamlet	[ _laying his hand on laertes ’ s head._ ] and these few precepts in thy memory look thou character . give thy thoughts no tongue , nor any unproportion ’ d thought his act . be thou familiar , but by no means vulgar . those friends thou hast , and their adoption tried , grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel ; but do not dull thy palm with entertainment of each new-hatch ’ d , unfledg ’ d comrade . beware of entrance to a quarrel ; but being in , bear ’ t that th ’ opposed may beware of thee . give every man thine ear , but few thy voice : take each man ’ s censure , but reserve thy judgment . costly thy habit as thy purse can buy , but not express ’ d in fancy ; rich , not gaudy : for the apparel oft proclaims the man ; and they in france of the best rank and station are of a most select and generous chief in that . neither a borrower nor a lender be : for loan oft loses both itself and friend ; and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry . this above all : to thine own self be true ; and it must follow , as the night the day , thou canst not then be false to any man . farewell : my blessing season this in thee .
shakespeare	hamlet	laertes . most humbly do i take my leave , my lord . polonius . the time invites you ; go , your servants tend . laertes . farewell , ophelia , and remember well what i have said to you .
shakespeare	hamlet	ophelia . ’ tis in my memory lock ’ d , and you yourself shall keep the key of it . laertes . farewell . [ _exit._ ] polonius . what is ’ t , ophelia , he hath said to you ? ophelia . so please you , something touching the lord hamlet .
shakespeare	hamlet	polonius . marry , well bethought : ’ tis told me he hath very oft of late given private time to you ; and you yourself have of your audience been most free and bounteous . if it be so , —as so ’ tis put on me , and that in way of caution , —i must tell you you do not understand yourself so clearly as it behoves my daughter and your honour . what is between you ? give me up the truth .
shakespeare	hamlet	ophelia . he hath , my lord , of late made many tenders of his affection to me . polonius . affection ! pooh ! you speak like a green girl , unsifted in such perilous circumstance . do you believe his tenders , as you call them ?
shakespeare	hamlet	ophelia . i do not know , my lord , what i should think . polonius . marry , i ’ ll teach you ; think yourself a baby ; that you have ta ’ en these tenders for true pay , which are not sterling . tender yourself more dearly ; or , —not to crack the wind of the poor phrase , roaming it thus , —you ’ ll tender me a fool .
shakespeare	hamlet	ophelia . my lord , he hath importun ’ d me with love in honourable fashion . polonius . ay , fashion you may call it ; go to , go to . ophelia . and hath given countenance to his speech , my lord , with almost all the holy vows of heaven .
shakespeare	hamlet	polonius . ay , springes to catch woodcocks . i do know , when the blood burns , how prodigal the soul lends the tongue vows : these blazes , daughter , giving more light than heat , extinct in both , even in their promise , as it is a-making , you must not take for fire . from this time be something scanter of your maiden presence ; set your entreatments at a higher rate than a command to parley . for lord hamlet , believe so much in him that he is young ; and with a larger tether may he walk than may be given you . in few , ophelia , do not believe his vows ; for they are brokers , not of that dye which their investments show , but mere implorators of unholy suits , breathing like sanctified and pious bawds , the better to beguile . this is for all . i would not , in plain terms , from this time forth have you so slander any moment leisure as to give words or talk with the lord hamlet . look to ’ t , i charge you ; come your ways .
shakespeare	hamlet	ophelia . i shall obey , my lord . [ _exeunt._ ] scene iv . the platform . enter hamlet , horatio and marcellus . hamlet . the air bites shrewdly ; it is very cold . horatio . it is a nipping and an eager air .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . what hour now ? horatio . i think it lacks of twelve . marcellus . no , it is struck . horatio . indeed ? i heard it not . it then draws near the season wherein the spirit held his wont to walk .
shakespeare	hamlet	[ _a flourish of trumpets , and ordnance shot off within._ ] what does this mean , my lord ? hamlet . the king doth wake tonight and takes his rouse , keeps wassail , and the swaggering upspring reels ; and as he drains his draughts of rhenish down , the kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out the triumph of his pledge .
shakespeare	hamlet	horatio . is it a custom ? hamlet . ay marry is ’ t ; and to my mind , though i am native here , and to the manner born , it is a custom more honour ’ d in the breach than the observance . this heavy-headed revel east and west makes us traduc ’ d and tax ’ d of other nations : they clepe us drunkards , and with swinish phrase soil our addition ; and indeed it takes from our achievements , though perform ’ d at height , the pith and marrow of our attribute . so oft it chances in particular men that for some vicious mole of nature in them , as in their birth , wherein they are not guilty , since nature can not choose his origin , by their o ’ ergrowth of some complexion , oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason ; or by some habit , that too much o ’ erleavens the form of plausive manners ; —that these men , carrying , i say , the stamp of one defect , being nature ’ s livery or fortune ’ s star , — his virtues else , —be they as pure as grace , as infinite as man may undergo , shall in the general censure take corruption from that particular fault . the dram of evil doth all the noble substance often doubt to his own scandal .
shakespeare	hamlet	horatio . look , my lord , it comes ! enter ghost . hamlet . angels and ministers of grace defend us ! be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn ’ d , bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell , be thy intents wicked or charitable , thou com ’ st in such a questionable shape that i will speak to thee . i ’ ll call thee hamlet , king , father , royal dane . o , answer me ! let me not burst in ignorance ; but tell why thy canoniz ’ d bones , hearsed in death , have burst their cerements ; why the sepulchre , wherein we saw thee quietly inurn ’ d , hath op ’ d his ponderous and marble jaws to cast thee up again ! what may this mean , that thou , dead corse , again in complete steel , revisit ’ st thus the glimpses of the moon , making night hideous , and we fools of nature so horridly to shake our disposition with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls ? say , why is this ? wherefore ? what should we do ?
shakespeare	hamlet	[ _ghost beckons hamlet._ ] horatio . it beckons you to go away with it , as if it some impartment did desire to you alone . marcellus . look with what courteous action it waves you to a more removed ground . but do not go with it .
shakespeare	hamlet	horatio . no , by no means . hamlet . it will not speak ; then will i follow it . horatio . do not , my lord . hamlet . why , what should be the fear ? i do not set my life at a pin ’ s fee ; and for my soul , what can it do to that , being a thing immortal as itself ? it waves me forth again . i ’ ll follow it .
shakespeare	hamlet	horatio . what if it tempt you toward the flood , my lord , or to the dreadful summit of the cliff that beetles o ’ er his base into the sea , and there assume some other horrible form which might deprive your sovereignty of reason , and draw you into madness ? think of it . the very place puts toys of desperation , without more motive , into every brain that looks so many fadoms to the sea and hears it roar beneath .

shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . haste me to know ’ t , that i , with wings as swift as meditation or the thoughts of love may sweep to my revenge . ghost . i find thee apt ; and duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed that rots itself in ease on lethe wharf , wouldst thou not stir in this . now , hamlet , hear . ’ tis given out that , sleeping in my orchard , a serpent stung me ; so the whole ear of denmark is by a forged process of my death rankly abus ’ d ; but know , thou noble youth , the serpent that did sting thy father ’ s life now wears his crown .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . o my prophetic soul ! mine uncle ! ghost . ay , that incestuous , that adulterate beast , with witchcraft of his wit , with traitorous gifts , — o wicked wit , and gifts , that have the power so to seduce ! —won to his shameful lust the will of my most seeming-virtuous queen . o hamlet , what a falling off was there , from me , whose love was of that dignity that it went hand in hand even with the vow i made to her in marriage ; and to decline upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor to those of mine . but virtue , as it never will be mov ’ d , though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven ; so lust , though to a radiant angel link ’ d , will sate itself in a celestial bed and prey on garbage . but soft ! methinks i scent the morning air ; brief let me be . sleeping within my orchard , my custom always of the afternoon , upon my secure hour thy uncle stole with juice of cursed hebenon in a vial , and in the porches of my ears did pour the leperous distilment , whose effect holds such an enmity with blood of man that swift as quicksilver it courses through the natural gates and alleys of the body ; and with a sudden vigour it doth posset and curd , like eager droppings into milk , the thin and wholesome blood . so did it mine ; and a most instant tetter bark ’ d about , most lazar-like , with vile and loathsome crust all my smooth body . thus was i , sleeping , by a brother ’ s hand , of life , of crown , of queen at once dispatch ’ d : cut off even in the blossoms of my sin , unhous ’ led , disappointed , unanel ’ d ; no reckoning made , but sent to my account with all my imperfections on my head . o horrible ! o horrible ! most horrible ! if thou hast nature in thee , bear it not ; let not the royal bed of denmark be a couch for luxury and damned incest . but howsoever thou pursu ’ st this act , taint not thy mind , nor let thy soul contrive against thy mother aught ; leave her to heaven , and to those thorns that in her bosom lodge , to prick and sting her . fare thee well at once ! the glow-worm shows the matin to be near , and ’ gins to pale his uneffectual fire . adieu , adieu , adieu . hamlet , remember me .
shakespeare	hamlet	[ _exit._ ] hamlet . o all you host of heaven ! o earth ! what else ? and shall i couple hell ? o , fie ! hold , my heart ; and you , my sinews , grow not instant old , but bear me stiffly up . remember thee ? ay , thou poor ghost , while memory holds a seat in this distracted globe . remember thee ? yea , from the table of my memory i ’ ll wipe away all trivial fond records , all saws of books , all forms , all pressures past , that youth and observation copied there ; and thy commandment all alone shall live within the book and volume of my brain , unmix ’ d with baser matter . yes , by heaven ! o most pernicious woman ! o villain , villain , smiling damned villain ! my tables . meet it is i set it down , that one may smile , and smile , and be a villain ! at least i am sure it may be so in denmark .

shakespeare	hamlet	horatio . there needs no ghost , my lord , come from the grave to tell us this . hamlet . why , right ; you are i ’ the right ; and so , without more circumstance at all , i hold it fit that we shake hands and part : you , as your business and desires shall point you , — for every man hath business and desire , such as it is ; —and for my own poor part , look you , i ’ ll go pray .
shakespeare	hamlet	horatio . these are but wild and whirling words , my lord . hamlet . i ’ m sorry they offend you , heartily ; yes faith , heartily . horatio . there ’ s no offence , my lord . hamlet . yes , by saint patrick , but there is , horatio , and much offence too . touching this vision here , it is an honest ghost , that let me tell you . for your desire to know what is between us , o ’ ermaster ’ t as you may . and now , good friends , as you are friends , scholars , and soldiers , give me one poor request .
shakespeare	hamlet	horatio . what is ’ t , my lord ? we will . hamlet . never make known what you have seen tonight . horatio and marcellus . my lord , we will not . hamlet . nay , but swear ’ t . horatio . in faith , my lord , not i .

shakespeare	hamlet	[ _exeunt._ ] act ii scene i . a room in polonius ’ s house . enter polonius and reynaldo . polonius . give him this money and these notes , reynaldo . reynaldo . i will , my lord . polonius . you shall do marvellous wisely , good reynaldo , before you visit him , to make inquiry of his behaviour .
shakespeare	hamlet	reynaldo . my lord , i did intend it . polonius . marry , well said ; very well said . look you , sir , enquire me first what danskers are in paris ; and how , and who , what means , and where they keep , what company , at what expense ; and finding by this encompassment and drift of question , that they do know my son , come you more nearer than your particular demands will touch it . take you as ’ twere some distant knowledge of him , as thus , ‘ i know his father and his friends , and in part him ’ —do you mark this , reynaldo ?
shakespeare	hamlet	reynaldo . ay , very well , my lord . polonius . ‘ and in part him , but , ’ you may say , ‘ not well ; but if ’ t be he i mean , he ’ s very wild ; addicted so and so ; ’ and there put on him what forgeries you please ; marry , none so rank as may dishonour him ; take heed of that ; but , sir , such wanton , wild , and usual slips as are companions noted and most known to youth and liberty .
shakespeare	hamlet	reynaldo . as gaming , my lord ? polonius . ay , or drinking , fencing , swearing , quarrelling , drabbing . you may go so far . reynaldo . my lord , that would dishonour him . polonius . faith no , as you may season it in the charge . you must not put another scandal on him , that he is open to incontinency ; that ’ s not my meaning : but breathe his faults so quaintly that they may seem the taints of liberty ; the flash and outbreak of a fiery mind , a savageness in unreclaimed blood , of general assault .
shakespeare	hamlet	reynaldo . but my good lord— polonius . wherefore should you do this ? reynaldo . ay , my lord , i would know that . polonius . marry , sir , here ’ s my drift , and i believe it is a fetch of warrant . you laying these slight sullies on my son , as ’ twere a thing a little soil ’ d i ’ th ’ working , mark you , your party in converse , him you would sound , having ever seen in the prenominate crimes the youth you breathe of guilty , be assur ’ d he closes with you in this consequence ; ‘ good sir , ’ or so ; or ‘ friend , ’ or ‘ gentleman ’ — according to the phrase or the addition of man and country .
shakespeare	hamlet	reynaldo . very good , my lord . polonius . and then , sir , does he this , — he does—what was i about to say ? by the mass , i was about to say something . where did i leave ?
shakespeare	hamlet	reynaldo . at ‘ closes in the consequence. ’ at ‘ friend or so , ’ and ‘ gentleman. ’ polonius . at ‘ closes in the consequence ’ ay , marry ! he closes with you thus : ‘ i know the gentleman , i saw him yesterday , or t ’ other day , or then , or then , with such and such ; and , as you say , there was he gaming , there o ’ ertook in ’ s rouse , there falling out at tennis ’ : or perchance , ‘ i saw him enter such a house of sale ’ — _videlicet_ , a brothel , or so forth . see you now ; your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth ; and thus do we of wisdom and of reach , with windlasses , and with assays of bias , by indirections find directions out . so by my former lecture and advice shall you my son . you have me , have you not ?
shakespeare	hamlet	reynaldo . my lord , i have . polonius . god b ’ wi ’ you , fare you well . reynaldo . good my lord . polonius . observe his inclination in yourself . reynaldo . i shall , my lord . polonius . and let him ply his music .
shakespeare	hamlet	reynaldo . well , my lord . polonius . farewell . [ _exit reynaldo._ ] enter ophelia . how now , ophelia , what ’ s the matter ? ophelia . alas , my lord , i have been so affrighted . polonius . with what , in the name of god ?
shakespeare	hamlet	ophelia . my lord , as i was sewing in my chamber , lord hamlet , with his doublet all unbrac ’ d , no hat upon his head , his stockings foul ’ d , ungart ’ red , and down-gyved to his ankle , pale as his shirt , his knees knocking each other , and with a look so piteous in purport as if he had been loosed out of hell to speak of horrors , he comes before me .
shakespeare	hamlet	polonius . mad for thy love ? ophelia . my lord , i do not know , but truly i do fear it . polonius . what said he ? ophelia . he took me by the wrist and held me hard ; then goes he to the length of all his arm ; and with his other hand thus o ’ er his brow , he falls to such perusal of my face as he would draw it . long stay ’ d he so , at last , —a little shaking of mine arm , and thrice his head thus waving up and down , he rais ’ d a sigh so piteous and profound as it did seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being . that done , he lets me go , and with his head over his shoulder turn ’ d he seem ’ d to find his way without his eyes , for out o ’ doors he went without their help , and to the last bended their light on me .
shakespeare	hamlet	polonius . come , go with me . i will go seek the king . this is the very ecstasy of love , whose violent property fordoes itself , and leads the will to desperate undertakings , as oft as any passion under heaven that does afflict our natures . i am sorry , — what , have you given him any hard words of late ?
shakespeare	hamlet	ophelia . no , my good lord ; but as you did command , i did repel his letters and denied his access to me . polonius . that hath made him mad . i am sorry that with better heed and judgment i had not quoted him . i fear ’ d he did but trifle , and meant to wreck thee . but beshrew my jealousy ! it seems it is as proper to our age to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions as it is common for the younger sort to lack discretion . come , go we to the king . this must be known , which , being kept close , might move more grief to hide than hate to utter love .
shakespeare	hamlet	[ _exeunt._ ] scene ii . a room in the castle . enter king , queen , rosencrantz , guildenstern and attendants . king . welcome , dear rosencrantz and guildenstern . moreover that we much did long to see you , the need we have to use you did provoke our hasty sending . something have you heard of hamlet ’ s transformation ; so i call it , since nor th ’ exterior nor the inward man resembles that it was . what it should be , more than his father ’ s death , that thus hath put him so much from th ’ understanding of himself , i can not dream of . i entreat you both that , being of so young days brought up with him , and since so neighbour ’ d to his youth and humour , that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court some little time , so by your companies to draw him on to pleasures and to gather , so much as from occasion you may glean , whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus that , open ’ d , lies within our remedy .
shakespeare	hamlet	queen . good gentlemen , he hath much talk ’ d of you , and sure i am , two men there are not living to whom he more adheres . if it will please you to show us so much gentry and good will as to expend your time with us awhile , for the supply and profit of our hope , your visitation shall receive such thanks as fits a king ’ s remembrance .
shakespeare	hamlet	rosencrantz . both your majesties might , by the sovereign power you have of us , put your dread pleasures more into command than to entreaty . guildenstern . we both obey , and here give up ourselves , in the full bent , to lay our service freely at your feet to be commanded .
shakespeare	hamlet	king . thanks , rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern . queen . thanks , guildenstern and gentle rosencrantz . and i beseech you instantly to visit my too much changed son . go , some of you , and bring these gentlemen where hamlet is .
shakespeare	hamlet	guildenstern . heavens make our presence and our practices pleasant and helpful to him . queen . ay , amen . [ _exeunt rosencrantz , guildenstern and some attendants._ ] enter polonius . polonius . th ’ ambassadors from norway , my good lord , are joyfully return ’ d .
shakespeare	hamlet	king . thou still hast been the father of good news . polonius . have i , my lord ? assure you , my good liege , i hold my duty , as i hold my soul , both to my god and to my gracious king : and i do think , —or else this brain of mine hunts not the trail of policy so sure as it hath us ’ d to do—that i have found the very cause of hamlet ’ s lunacy .
shakespeare	hamlet	king . o speak of that , that do i long to hear . polonius . give first admittance to th ’ ambassadors ; my news shall be the fruit to that great feast . king . thyself do grace to them , and bring them in .
shakespeare	hamlet	[ _exit polonius._ ] he tells me , my sweet queen , that he hath found the head and source of all your son ’ s distemper . queen . i doubt it is no other but the main , his father ’ s death and our o ’ erhasty marriage .
shakespeare	hamlet	king . well , we shall sift him . enter polonius with voltemand and cornelius . welcome , my good friends ! say , voltemand , what from our brother norway ? voltemand . most fair return of greetings and desires . upon our first , he sent out to suppress his nephew ’ s levies , which to him appear ’ d to be a preparation ’ gainst the polack ; but better look ’ d into , he truly found it was against your highness ; whereat griev ’ d , that so his sickness , age , and impotence was falsely borne in hand , sends out arrests on fortinbras ; which he , in brief , obeys , receives rebuke from norway ; and in fine , makes vow before his uncle never more to give th ’ assay of arms against your majesty . whereon old norway , overcome with joy , gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee , and his commission to employ those soldiers so levied as before , against the polack : with an entreaty , herein further shown , [ _gives a paper._ ] that it might please you to give quiet pass through your dominions for this enterprise , on such regards of safety and allowance as therein are set down .
shakespeare	hamlet	king . it likes us well ; and at our more consider ’ d time we ’ ll read , answer , and think upon this business . meantime we thank you for your well-took labour . go to your rest , at night we ’ ll feast together : . most welcome home .
shakespeare	hamlet	[ _exeunt voltemand and cornelius._ ] polonius . this business is well ended . my liege and madam , to expostulate what majesty should be , what duty is , why day is day , night night , and time is time . were nothing but to waste night , day and time . therefore , since brevity is the soul of wit , and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes , i will be brief . your noble son is mad . mad call i it ; for to define true madness , what is ’ t but to be nothing else but mad ? but let that go .
shakespeare	hamlet	queen . more matter , with less art . polonius . madam , i swear i use no art at all . that he is mad , ’ tis true : ’ tis true ’ tis pity ; and pity ’ tis ’ tis true . a foolish figure , but farewell it , for i will use no art . mad let us grant him then . and now remains that we find out the cause of this effect , or rather say , the cause of this defect , for this effect defective comes by cause . thus it remains , and the remainder thus . perpend , i have a daughter—have whilst she is mine— who in her duty and obedience , mark , hath given me this . now gather , and surmise . [ _reads._ ] _to the celestial , and my soul ’ s idol , the most beautified ophelia_— that ’ s an ill phrase , a vile phrase ; ‘ beautified ’ is a vile phrase : but you shall hear . [ _reads._ ] _these ; in her excellent white bosom , these , & c._
shakespeare	hamlet	queen . came this from hamlet to her ? polonius . good madam , stay awhile ; i will be faithful . [ _reads._ ] _doubt thou the stars are fire , doubt that the sun doth move , doubt truth to be a liar , but never doubt i love . o dear ophelia , i am ill at these numbers . i have not art to reckon my groans . but that i love thee best , o most best , believe it . adieu . thine evermore , most dear lady , whilst this machine is to him , hamlet._ this in obedience hath my daughter show ’ d me ; and more above , hath his solicitings , as they fell out by time , by means , and place , all given to mine ear .
shakespeare	hamlet	king . but how hath she receiv ’ d his love ? polonius . what do you think of me ? king . as of a man faithful and honourable . polonius . i would fain prove so . but what might you think , when i had seen this hot love on the wing , as i perceiv ’ d it , i must tell you that , before my daughter told me , what might you , or my dear majesty your queen here , think , if i had play ’ d the desk or table-book , or given my heart a winking , mute and dumb , or look ’ d upon this love with idle sight , what might you think ? no , i went round to work , and my young mistress thus i did bespeak : ‘ lord hamlet is a prince , out of thy star . this must not be. ’ and then i precepts gave her , that she should lock herself from his resort , admit no messengers , receive no tokens . which done , she took the fruits of my advice , and he , repulsed , —a short tale to make— fell into a sadness , then into a fast , thence to a watch , thence into a weakness , thence to a lightness , and , by this declension , into the madness wherein now he raves , and all we wail for .
shakespeare	hamlet	king . do you think ’ tis this ? queen . it may be , very likely . polonius . hath there been such a time , i ’ d fain know that , that i have positively said ‘ ’ tis so , ’ when it prov ’ d otherwise ?
shakespeare	hamlet	king . not that i know . polonius . take this from this , if this be otherwise . [ _points to his head and shoulder._ ] if circumstances lead me , i will find where truth is hid , though it were hid indeed within the centre .
shakespeare	hamlet	king . how may we try it further ? polonius . you know sometimes he walks four hours together here in the lobby . queen . so he does indeed . polonius . at such a time i ’ ll loose my daughter to him . be you and i behind an arras then , mark the encounter . if he love her not , and be not from his reason fall ’ n thereon , let me be no assistant for a state , but keep a farm and carters .
shakespeare	hamlet	king . we will try it . enter hamlet , reading . queen . but look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading . polonius . away , i do beseech you , both away i ’ ll board him presently . o , give me leave .
shakespeare	hamlet	[ _exeunt king , queen and attendants._ ] how does my good lord hamlet ? hamlet . well , god-a-mercy . polonius . do you know me , my lord ? hamlet . excellent well . you ’ re a fishmonger . polonius . not i , my lord .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . then i would you were so honest a man . polonius . honest , my lord ? hamlet . ay sir , to be honest , as this world goes , is to be one man picked out of ten thousand .
shakespeare	hamlet	polonius . that ’ s very true , my lord . hamlet . for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog , being a good kissing carrion , — have you a daughter ? polonius . i have , my lord .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . let her not walk i ’ th ’ sun . conception is a blessing , but not as your daughter may conceive . friend , look to ’ t . polonius . how say you by that ? [ _aside._ ] still harping on my daughter . yet he knew me not at first ; he said i was a fishmonger . he is far gone , far gone . and truly in my youth i suffered much extremity for love ; very near this . i ’ ll speak to him again.—what do you read , my lord ?
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . words , words , words . polonius . what is the matter , my lord ? hamlet . between who ? polonius . i mean the matter that you read , my lord . hamlet . slanders , sir . for the satirical slave says here that old men have grey beards ; that their faces are wrinkled ; their eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree gum ; and that they have a plentiful lack of wit , together with most weak hams . all which , sir , though i most powerfully and potently believe , yet i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down . for you yourself , sir , should be old as i am , if like a crab you could go backward .
shakespeare	hamlet	polonius . [ _aside._ ] though this be madness , yet there is a method in ’ t.— will you walk out of the air , my lord ? hamlet . into my grave ? polonius . indeed , that is out o ’ the air . [ _aside._ ] how pregnant sometimes his replies are ! a happiness that often madness hits on , which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of . i will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter . my honourable lord , i will most humbly take my leave of you .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . you can not , sir , take from me anything that i will more willingly part withal , except my life , except my life , except my life . polonius . fare you well , my lord .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . these tedious old fools . enter rosencrantz and guildenstern . polonius . you go to seek the lord hamlet ; there he is . rosencrantz . [ _to polonius._ ] god save you , sir . [ _exit polonius._ ] guildenstern . my honoured lord !
shakespeare	hamlet	rosencrantz . my most dear lord ! hamlet . my excellent good friends ! how dost thou , guildenstern ? ah , rosencrantz . good lads , how do ye both ? rosencrantz . as the indifferent children of the earth .
shakespeare	hamlet	guildenstern . happy in that we are not over-happy ; on fortune ’ s cap we are not the very button . hamlet . nor the soles of her shoe ? rosencrantz . neither , my lord . hamlet . then you live about her waist , or in the middle of her favours ?
shakespeare	hamlet	guildenstern . faith , her privates we . hamlet . in the secret parts of fortune ? o , most true ; she is a strumpet . what ’ s the news ? rosencrantz . none , my lord , but that the world ’ s grown honest .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . then is doomsday near . but your news is not true . let me question more in particular . what have you , my good friends , deserved at the hands of fortune , that she sends you to prison hither ?
shakespeare	hamlet	guildenstern . prison , my lord ? hamlet . denmark ’ s a prison . rosencrantz . then is the world one . hamlet . a goodly one ; in which there are many confines , wards , and dungeons , denmark being one o ’ th ’ worst .
shakespeare	hamlet	rosencrantz . we think not so , my lord . hamlet . why , then ’ tis none to you ; for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so . to me it is a prison .
shakespeare	hamlet	rosencrantz . why , then your ambition makes it one ; ’ tis too narrow for your mind . hamlet . o god , i could be bounded in a nutshell , and count myself a king of infinite space , were it not that i have bad dreams .
shakespeare	hamlet	guildenstern . which dreams , indeed , are ambition ; for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream . hamlet . a dream itself is but a shadow . rosencrantz . truly , and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow ’ s shadow .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . then are our beggars bodies , and our monarchs and outstretch ’ d heroes the beggars ’ shadows . shall we to th ’ court ? for , by my fay , i can not reason . rosencrantz and guildenstern . we ’ ll wait upon you .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . no such matter . i will not sort you with the rest of my servants ; for , to speak to you like an honest man , i am most dreadfully attended . but , in the beaten way of friendship , what make you at elsinore ?
shakespeare	hamlet	rosencrantz . to visit you , my lord , no other occasion . hamlet . beggar that i am , i am even poor in thanks ; but i thank you . and sure , dear friends , my thanks are too dear a halfpenny . were you not sent for ? is it your own inclining ? is it a free visitation ? come , deal justly with me . come , come ; nay , speak .
shakespeare	hamlet	guildenstern . what should we say , my lord ? hamlet . why , anything . but to the purpose . you were sent for ; and there is a kind of confession in your looks , which your modesties have not craft enough to colour . i know the good king and queen have sent for you .
shakespeare	hamlet	rosencrantz . to what end , my lord ? hamlet . that you must teach me . but let me conjure you , by the rights of our fellowship , by the consonancy of our youth , by the obligation of our ever-preserved love , and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal , be even and direct with me , whether you were sent for or no .
shakespeare	hamlet	rosencrantz . [ _to guildenstern._ ] what say you ? hamlet . [ _aside._ ] nay , then i have an eye of you . if you love me , hold not off . guildenstern . my lord , we were sent for .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . i will tell you why ; so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery , and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather . i have of late , but wherefore i know not , lost all my mirth , forgone all custom of exercises ; and indeed , it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth , seems to me a sterile promontory ; this most excellent canopy the air , look you , this brave o ’ erhanging firmament , this majestical roof fretted with golden fire , why , it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours . what a piece of work is man ! how noble in reason ? how infinite in faculties , in form and moving , how express and admirable ? in action how like an angel ? in apprehension , how like a god ? the beauty of the world , the paragon of animals . and yet , to me , what is this quintessence of dust ? man delights not me ; no , nor woman neither , though by your smiling you seem to say so .
shakespeare	hamlet	rosencrantz . my lord , there was no such stuff in my thoughts . hamlet . why did you laugh then , when i said ‘ man delights not me ’ ? rosencrantz . to think , my lord , if you delight not in man , what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you . we coted them on the way , and hither are they coming to offer you service .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . he that plays the king shall be welcome , —his majesty shall have tribute of me ; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target ; the lover shall not sigh gratis , the humorous man shall end his part in peace ; the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle a ’ th ’ sere ; and the lady shall say her mind freely , or the blank verse shall halt for ’ t . what players are they ?
shakespeare	hamlet	rosencrantz . even those you were wont to take such delight in—the tragedians of the city . hamlet . how chances it they travel ? their residence , both in reputation and profit , was better both ways .
shakespeare	hamlet	rosencrantz . i think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation . hamlet . do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city ? are they so followed ?
shakespeare	hamlet	rosencrantz . no , indeed , they are not . hamlet . how comes it ? do they grow rusty ? rosencrantz . nay , their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace ; but there is , sir , an ayry of children , little eyases , that cry out on the top of question , and are most tyrannically clapped for ’ t . these are now the fashion , and so berattle the common stages—so they call them—that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and dare scarce come thither .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . what , are they children ? who maintains ’ em ? how are they escoted ? will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing ? will they not say afterwards , if they should grow themselves to common players—as it is most like , if their means are no better—their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession ?

shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . it is not very strange ; for my uncle is king of denmark , and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived , give twenty , forty , fifty , a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little . ’ sblood , there is something in this more than natural , if philosophy could find it out .
shakespeare	hamlet	[ _flourish of trumpets within._ ] guildenstern . there are the players . hamlet . gentlemen , you are welcome to elsinore . your hands , come . the appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony . let me comply with you in this garb , lest my extent to the players , which i tell you must show fairly outward , should more appear like entertainment than yours . you are welcome . but my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived .

shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . nay , that follows not . polonius . what follows then , my lord ? hamlet . why , as by lot , god wot , and then , you know , it came to pass , as most like it was . the first row of the pious chanson will show you more . for look where my abridgement comes .

shakespeare	hamlet	first player . what speech , my lord ? hamlet . i heard thee speak me a speech once , but it was never acted , or if it was , not above once , for the play , i remember , pleased not the million , ’ twas caviare to the general . but it was—as i received it , and others , whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine—an excellent play , well digested in the scenes , set down with as much modesty as cunning . i remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury , nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the author of affectation , but called it an honest method , as wholesome as sweet , and by very much more handsome than fine . one speech in it , i chiefly loved . ’ twas aeneas ’ tale to dido , and thereabout of it especially where he speaks of priam ’ s slaughter . if it live in your memory , begin at this line , let me see , let me see : _the rugged pyrrhus , like th ’ hyrcanian beast , —_ it is not so : it begins with pyrrhus— _the rugged pyrrhus , he whose sable arms , black as his purpose , did the night resemble when he lay couched in the ominous horse , hath now this dread and black complexion smear ’ d with heraldry more dismal . head to foot now is he total gules , horridly trick ’ d with blood of fathers , mothers , daughters , sons , bak ’ d and impasted with the parching streets , that lend a tyrannous and a damned light to their vile murders . roasted in wrath and fire , and thus o ’ ersized with coagulate gore , with eyes like carbuncles , the hellish pyrrhus old grandsire priam seeks._ so , proceed you .

shakespeare	hamlet	polonius . look , where he has not turn ’ d his colour , and has tears in ’ s eyes . pray you , no more . hamlet . ’ tis well . i ’ ll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.—good my lord , will you see the players well bestowed ? do you hear , let them be well used ; for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time . after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live .
shakespeare	hamlet	polonius . my lord , i will use them according to their desert . hamlet . god ’ s bodikin , man , better . use every man after his desert , and who should scape whipping ? use them after your own honour and dignity . the less they deserve , the more merit is in your bounty . take them in .
shakespeare	hamlet	polonius . come , sirs . hamlet . follow him , friends . we ’ ll hear a play tomorrow . [ _exeunt polonius with all the players but the first._ ] dost thou hear me , old friend ? can you play _the murder of gonzago_ ?
shakespeare	hamlet	first player . ay , my lord . hamlet . we ’ ll ha ’ t tomorrow night . you could for a need study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines , which i would set down and insert in ’ t , could you not ?

shakespeare	hamlet	rosencrantz . good my lord . [ _exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern._ ] hamlet . ay , so , god b ’ wi ’ ye . now i am alone . o what a rogue and peasant slave am i ! is it not monstrous that this player here , but in a fiction , in a dream of passion , could force his soul so to his own conceit that from her working all his visage wan ’ d ; tears in his eyes , distraction in ’ s aspect , a broken voice , and his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit ? and all for nothing ! for hecuba ? what ’ s hecuba to him , or he to hecuba , that he should weep for her ? what would he do , had he the motive and the cue for passion that i have ? he would drown the stage with tears and cleave the general ear with horrid speech ; make mad the guilty , and appal the free , confound the ignorant , and amaze indeed , the very faculties of eyes and ears . yet i , a dull and muddy-mettled rascal , peak like john-a-dreams , unpregnant of my cause , and can say nothing . no , not for a king upon whose property and most dear life a damn ’ d defeat was made . am i a coward ? who calls me villain , breaks my pate across ? plucks off my beard and blows it in my face ? tweaks me by the nose , gives me the lie i ’ th ’ throat as deep as to the lungs ? who does me this ? ha ! ’ swounds , i should take it : for it can not be but i am pigeon-liver ’ d , and lack gall to make oppression bitter , or ere this i should have fatted all the region kites with this slave ’ s offal . bloody , bawdy villain ! remorseless , treacherous , lecherous , kindless villain ! oh vengeance ! why , what an ass am i ! this is most brave , that i , the son of a dear father murder ’ d , prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell , must , like a whore , unpack my heart with words and fall a-cursing like a very drab , a scullion ! fie upon ’ t ! foh ! about , my brain ! i have heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play , have by the very cunning of the scene , been struck so to the soul that presently they have proclaim ’ d their malefactions . for murder , though it have no tongue , will speak with most miraculous organ . i ’ ll have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle . i ’ ll observe his looks ; i ’ ll tent him to the quick . if he but blench , i know my course . the spirit that i have seen may be the devil , and the devil hath power t ’ assume a pleasing shape , yea , and perhaps out of my weakness and my melancholy , as he is very potent with such spirits , abuses me to damn me . i ’ ll have grounds more relative than this . the play ’ s the thing wherein i ’ ll catch the conscience of the king .

shakespeare	hamlet	rosencrantz . he does confess he feels himself distracted , but from what cause he will by no means speak . guildenstern . nor do we find him forward to be sounded , but with a crafty madness keeps aloof when we would bring him on to some confession of his true state .
shakespeare	hamlet	queen . did he receive you well ? rosencrantz . most like a gentleman . guildenstern . but with much forcing of his disposition . rosencrantz . niggard of question , but of our demands , most free in his reply .
shakespeare	hamlet	queen . did you assay him to any pastime ? rosencrantz . madam , it so fell out that certain players we o ’ er-raught on the way . of these we told him , and there did seem in him a kind of joy to hear of it . they are about the court , and , as i think , they have already order this night to play before him .
shakespeare	hamlet	polonius . ’ tis most true ; and he beseech ’ d me to entreat your majesties to hear and see the matter . king . with all my heart ; and it doth much content me to hear him so inclin ’ d . good gentlemen , give him a further edge , and drive his purpose on to these delights .
shakespeare	hamlet	rosencrantz . we shall , my lord . [ _exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern._ ] king . sweet gertrude , leave us too , for we have closely sent for hamlet hither , that he , as ’ twere by accident , may here affront ophelia . her father and myself , lawful espials , will so bestow ourselves that , seeing unseen , we may of their encounter frankly judge , and gather by him , as he is behav ’ d , if ’ t be th ’ affliction of his love or no that thus he suffers for .
shakespeare	hamlet	queen . i shall obey you . and for your part , ophelia , i do wish that your good beauties be the happy cause of hamlet ’ s wildness : so shall i hope your virtues will bring him to his wonted way again , to both your honours .
shakespeare	hamlet	ophelia . madam , i wish it may . [ _exit queen._ ] polonius . ophelia , walk you here.—gracious , so please you , we will bestow ourselves.— [ _to ophelia._ ] read on this book , that show of such an exercise may colour your loneliness.—we are oft to blame in this , ’ tis too much prov ’ d , that with devotion ’ s visage and pious action we do sugar o ’ er the devil himself .
shakespeare	hamlet	king . [ _aside._ ] o ’ tis too true ! how smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience ! the harlot ’ s cheek , beautied with plastering art , is not more ugly to the thing that helps it than is my deed to my most painted word . o heavy burden !
shakespeare	hamlet	polonius . i hear him coming . let ’ s withdraw , my lord . [ _exeunt king and polonius._ ] enter hamlet . hamlet . to be , or not to be , that is the question : whether ’ tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune , or to take arms against a sea of troubles , and by opposing end them ? to die—to sleep , no more ; and by a sleep to say we end the heart-ache , and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to : ’ tis a consummation devoutly to be wish ’ d . to die , to sleep . to sleep , perchance to dream—ay , there ’ s the rub , for in that sleep of death what dreams may come , when we have shuffled off this mortal coil , must give us pause . there ’ s the respect that makes calamity of so long life . for who would bear the whips and scorns of time , the oppressor ’ s wrong , the proud man ’ s contumely , the pangs of dispriz ’ d love , the law ’ s delay , the insolence of office , and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes , when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin ? who would these fardels bear , to grunt and sweat under a weary life , but that the dread of something after death , the undiscover ’ d country , from whose bourn no traveller returns , puzzles the will , and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of ? thus conscience does make cowards of us all , and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o ’ er with the pale cast of thought , and enterprises of great pith and moment , with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of action . soft you now , the fair ophelia ! nymph , in thy orisons be all my sins remember ’ d .
shakespeare	hamlet	ophelia . good my lord , how does your honour for this many a day ? hamlet . i humbly thank you ; well , well , well . ophelia . my lord , i have remembrances of yours that i have longed long to re-deliver . i pray you , now receive them .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . no , not i. i never gave you aught . ophelia . my honour ’ d lord , you know right well you did , and with them words of so sweet breath compos ’ d as made the things more rich ; their perfume lost , take these again ; for to the noble mind rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind . there , my lord .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . ha , ha ! are you honest ? ophelia . my lord ? hamlet . are you fair ? ophelia . what means your lordship ? hamlet . that if you be honest and fair , your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty .
shakespeare	hamlet	ophelia . could beauty , my lord , have better commerce than with honesty ? hamlet . ay , truly ; for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness . this was sometime a paradox , but now the time gives it proof . i did love you once .
shakespeare	hamlet	ophelia . indeed , my lord , you made me believe so . hamlet . you should not have believed me ; for virtue can not so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it . i loved you not .
shakespeare	hamlet	ophelia . i was the more deceived . hamlet . get thee to a nunnery . why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners ? i am myself indifferent honest ; but yet i could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me . i am very proud , revengeful , ambitious , with more offences at my beck than i have thoughts to put them in , imagination to give them shape , or time to act them in . what should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and heaven ? we are arrant knaves all , believe none of us . go thy ways to a nunnery . where ’ s your father ?
shakespeare	hamlet	ophelia . at home , my lord . hamlet . let the doors be shut upon him , that he may play the fool nowhere but in ’ s own house . farewell . ophelia . o help him , you sweet heavens !
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . if thou dost marry , i ’ ll give thee this plague for thy dowry . be thou as chaste as ice , as pure as snow , thou shalt not escape calumny . get thee to a nunnery , go : farewell . or if thou wilt needs marry , marry a fool ; for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them . to a nunnery , go ; and quickly too . farewell .
shakespeare	hamlet	ophelia . o heavenly powers , restore him ! hamlet . i have heard of your paintings too , well enough . god hath given you one face , and you make yourselves another . you jig , you amble , and you lisp , and nickname god ’ s creatures , and make your wantonness your ignorance . go to , i ’ ll no more on ’ t , it hath made me mad . i say , we will have no more marriages . those that are married already , all but one , shall live ; the rest shall keep as they are . to a nunnery , go .
shakespeare	hamlet	[ _exit._ ] ophelia . o , what a noble mind is here o ’ erthrown ! the courtier ’ s , soldier ’ s , scholar ’ s , eye , tongue , sword , th ’ expectancy and rose of the fair state , the glass of fashion and the mould of form , th ’ observ ’ d of all observers , quite , quite down ! and i , of ladies most deject and wretched , that suck ’ d the honey of his music vows , now see that noble and most sovereign reason , like sweet bells jangled out of tune and harsh , that unmatch ’ d form and feature of blown youth blasted with ecstasy . o woe is me , t ’ have seen what i have seen , see what i see .
shakespeare	hamlet	enter king and polonius . king . love ? his affections do not that way tend , nor what he spake , though it lack ’ d form a little , was not like madness . there ’ s something in his soul o ’ er which his melancholy sits on brood , and i do doubt the hatch and the disclose will be some danger , which for to prevent , i have in quick determination thus set it down : he shall with speed to england for the demand of our neglected tribute : haply the seas and countries different , with variable objects , shall expel this something settled matter in his heart , whereon his brains still beating puts him thus from fashion of himself . what think you on ’ t ?
shakespeare	hamlet	polonius . it shall do well . but yet do i believe the origin and commencement of his grief sprung from neglected love . how now , ophelia ? you need not tell us what lord hamlet said , we heard it all . my lord , do as you please , but if you hold it fit , after the play , let his queen mother all alone entreat him to show his grief , let her be round with him , and i ’ ll be plac ’ d , so please you , in the ear of all their conference . if she find him not , to england send him ; or confine him where your wisdom best shall think .
shakespeare	hamlet	king . it shall be so . madness in great ones must not unwatch ’ d go . [ _exeunt._ ] scene ii . a hall in the castle . enter hamlet and certain players . hamlet . speak the speech , i pray you , as i pronounced it to you , trippingly on the tongue . but if you mouth it , as many of your players do , i had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines . nor do not saw the air too much with your hand , thus , but use all gently ; for in the very torrent , tempest , and , as i may say , whirlwind of passion , you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness . o , it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters , to very rags , to split the ears of the groundlings , who , for the most part , are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise . i would have such a fellow whipped for o ’ erdoing termagant . it out-herods herod . pray you avoid it .
shakespeare	hamlet	first player . i warrant your honour . hamlet . be not too tame neither ; but let your own discretion be your tutor . suit the action to the word , the word to the action , with this special observance , that you o ’ erstep not the modesty of nature ; for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing , whose end , both at the first and now , was and is , to hold as ’ twere the mirror up to nature ; to show virtue her own feature , scorn her own image , and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure . now , this overdone , or come tardy off , though it make the unskilful laugh , can not but make the judicious grieve ; the censure of the which one must in your allowance o ’ erweigh a whole theatre of others . o , there be players that i have seen play—and heard others praise , and that highly—not to speak it profanely , that , neither having the accent of christians , nor the gait of christian , pagan , nor man , have so strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of nature ’ s journeymen had made men , and not made them well , they imitated humanity so abominably .
shakespeare	hamlet	first player . i hope we have reform ’ d that indifferently with us , sir . hamlet . o reform it altogether . and let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them . for there be of them that will themselves laugh , to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too , though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered . that ’ s villanous , and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it . go make you ready .

shakespeare	hamlet	player king . i do believe you think what now you speak ; but what we do determine , oft we break . purpose is but the slave to memory , of violent birth , but poor validity : which now , like fruit unripe , sticks on the tree , but fall unshaken when they mellow be . most necessary ’ tis that we forget to pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt . what to ourselves in passion we propose , the passion ending , doth the purpose lose . the violence of either grief or joy their own enactures with themselves destroy . where joy most revels , grief doth most lament ; grief joys , joy grieves , on slender accident . this world is not for aye ; nor ’ tis not strange that even our loves should with our fortunes change , for ’ tis a question left us yet to prove , whether love lead fortune , or else fortune love . the great man down , you mark his favourite flies , the poor advanc ’ d makes friends of enemies ; and hitherto doth love on fortune tend : for who not needs shall never lack a friend , and who in want a hollow friend doth try , directly seasons him his enemy . but orderly to end where i begun , our wills and fates do so contrary run that our devices still are overthrown . our thoughts are ours , their ends none of our own . so think thou wilt no second husband wed , but die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead .
shakespeare	hamlet	player queen . nor earth to me give food , nor heaven light , sport and repose lock from me day and night , to desperation turn my trust and hope , an anchor ’ s cheer in prison be my scope , each opposite that blanks the face of joy , meet what i would have well , and it destroy ! both here and hence pursue me lasting strife , if , once a widow , ever i be wife .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . [ _to ophelia._ ] if she should break it now . player king . ’ tis deeply sworn . sweet , leave me here awhile . my spirits grow dull , and fain i would beguile the tedious day with sleep . [ _sleeps._ ]

shakespeare	hamlet	king . have you heard the argument ? is there no offence in ’ t ? hamlet . no , no , they do but jest , poison in jest ; no offence i ’ th ’ world . king . what do you call the play ?
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . _the mousetrap._ marry , how ? tropically . this play is the image of a murder done in vienna . gonzago is the duke ’ s name , his wife baptista : you shall see anon ; ’ tis a knavish piece of work : but what o ’ that ? your majesty , and we that have free souls , it touches us not . let the gall ’ d jade wince ; our withers are unwrung .

shakespeare	hamlet	[ _pours the poison into the sleeper ’ s ears._ ] hamlet . he poisons him i ’ th ’ garden for ’ s estate . his name ’ s gonzago . the story is extant , and written in very choice italian . you shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of gonzago ’ s wife .
shakespeare	hamlet	ophelia . the king rises . hamlet . what , frighted with false fire ? queen . how fares my lord ? polonius . give o ’ er the play . king . give me some light . away . all . lights , lights , lights .
shakespeare	hamlet	[ _exeunt all but hamlet and horatio._ ] hamlet . why , let the strucken deer go weep , the hart ungalled play ; for some must watch , while some must sleep , so runs the world away . would not this , sir , and a forest of feathers , if the rest of my fortunes turn turk with me ; with two provincial roses on my razed shoes , get me a fellowship in a cry of players , sir ?
shakespeare	hamlet	horatio . half a share . hamlet . a whole one , i . for thou dost know , o damon dear , this realm dismantled was of jove himself , and now reigns here a very , very—pajock .

shakespeare	hamlet	horatio . i did very well note him . hamlet . ah , ha ! come , some music . come , the recorders . for if the king like not the comedy , why then , belike he likes it not , perdie . come , some music .

shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . with drink , sir ? guildenstern . no , my lord ; rather with choler . hamlet . your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to the doctor , for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far more choler .
shakespeare	hamlet	guildenstern . good my lord , put your discourse into some frame , and start not so wildly from my affair . hamlet . i am tame , sir , pronounce . guildenstern . the queen your mother , in most great affliction of spirit , hath sent me to you .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . you are welcome . guildenstern . nay , good my lord , this courtesy is not of the right breed . if it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer , i will do your mother ’ s commandment ; if not , your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . sir , i can not . guildenstern . what , my lord ? hamlet . make you a wholesome answer . my wit ’ s diseased . but , sir , such answer as i can make , you shall command ; or rather , as you say , my mother . therefore no more , but to the matter . my mother , you say , —
shakespeare	hamlet	rosencrantz . then thus she says : your behaviour hath struck her into amazement and admiration . hamlet . o wonderful son , that can so stonish a mother ! but is there no sequel at the heels of this mother ’ s admiration ?
shakespeare	hamlet	rosencrantz . she desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed . hamlet . we shall obey , were she ten times our mother . have you any further trade with us ?
shakespeare	hamlet	rosencrantz . my lord , you once did love me . hamlet . and so i do still , by these pickers and stealers . rosencrantz . good my lord , what is your cause of distemper ? you do surely bar the door upon your own liberty if you deny your griefs to your friend .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . sir , i lack advancement . rosencrantz . how can that be , when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in denmark ? hamlet . ay , sir , but while the grass grows—the proverb is something musty .
shakespeare	hamlet	re-enter the players with recorders . o , the recorders . let me see one.—to withdraw with you , why do you go about to recover the wind of me , as if you would drive me into a toil ?
shakespeare	hamlet	guildenstern . o my lord , if my duty be too bold , my love is too unmannerly . hamlet . i do not well understand that . will you play upon this pipe ? guildenstern . my lord , i can not .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . i pray you . guildenstern . believe me , i can not . hamlet . i do beseech you . guildenstern . i know no touch of it , my lord . hamlet . ’ tis as easy as lying : govern these ventages with your finger and thumb , give it breath with your mouth , and it will discourse most eloquent music . look you , these are the stops .
shakespeare	hamlet	guildenstern . but these can not i command to any utterance of harmony . i have not the skill . hamlet . why , look you now , how unworthy a thing you make of me ! you would play upon me ; you would seem to know my stops ; you would pluck out the heart of my mystery ; you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass ; and there is much music , excellent voice , in this little organ , yet can not you make it speak . ’ sblood , do you think i am easier to be played on than a pipe ? call me what instrument you will , though you can fret me , you can not play upon me .
shakespeare	hamlet	enter polonius . god bless you , sir . polonius . my lord , the queen would speak with you , and presently . hamlet . do you see yonder cloud that ’ s almost in shape of a camel ?

shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . then will i come to my mother by and by.—they fool me to the top of my bent.—i will come by and by . polonius . i will say so . [ _exit._ ]
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . by and by is easily said . leave me , friends . [ _exeunt all but hamlet._ ] ’ tis now the very witching time of night , when churchyards yawn , and hell itself breathes out contagion to this world . now could i drink hot blood , and do such bitter business as the day would quake to look on . soft now , to my mother . o heart , lose not thy nature ; let not ever the soul of nero enter this firm bosom : let me be cruel , not unnatural . i will speak daggers to her , but use none ; my tongue and soul in this be hypocrites . how in my words somever she be shent , to give them seals never , my soul , consent .

shakespeare	hamlet	guildenstern . we will ourselves provide . most holy and religious fear it is to keep those many many bodies safe that live and feed upon your majesty . rosencrantz . the single and peculiar life is bound with all the strength and armour of the mind , to keep itself from ’ noyance ; but much more that spirit upon whose weal depend and rest the lives of many . the cease of majesty dies not alone ; but like a gulf doth draw what ’ s near it with it . it is a massy wheel fix ’ d on the summit of the highest mount , to whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things are mortis ’ d and adjoin ’ d ; which when it falls , each small annexment , petty consequence , attends the boist ’ rous ruin . never alone did the king sigh , but with a general groan .
shakespeare	hamlet	king . arm you , i pray you , to this speedy voyage ; for we will fetters put upon this fear , which now goes too free-footed . rosencrantz and guildenstern . we will haste us .

shakespeare	hamlet	king . thanks , dear my lord . [ _exit polonius._ ] o , my offence is rank , it smells to heaven ; it hath the primal eldest curse upon ’ t , — a brother ’ s murder ! pray can i not , though inclination be as sharp as will : my stronger guilt defeats my strong intent , and , like a man to double business bound , i stand in pause where i shall first begin , and both neglect . what if this cursed hand were thicker than itself with brother ’ s blood , is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens to wash it white as snow ? whereto serves mercy but to confront the visage of offence ? and what ’ s in prayer but this twofold force , to be forestalled ere we come to fall , or pardon ’ d being down ? then i ’ ll look up . my fault is past . but o , what form of prayer can serve my turn ? forgive me my foul murder ! that can not be ; since i am still possess ’ d of those effects for which i did the murder , — my crown , mine own ambition , and my queen . may one be pardon ’ d and retain th ’ offence ? in the corrupted currents of this world offence ’ s gilded hand may shove by justice , and oft ’ tis seen the wicked prize itself buys out the law . but ’ tis not so above ; there is no shuffling , there the action lies in his true nature , and we ourselves compell ’ d even to the teeth and forehead of our faults , to give in evidence . what then ? what rests ? try what repentance can . what can it not ? yet what can it , when one can not repent ? o wretched state ! o bosom black as death ! o limed soul , that struggling to be free , art more engag ’ d ! help , angels ! make assay : bow , stubborn knees ; and heart with strings of steel , be soft as sinews of the new-born babe . all may be well .

shakespeare	hamlet	queen . hamlet , thou hast thy father much offended . hamlet . mother , you have my father much offended . queen . come , come , you answer with an idle tongue . hamlet . go , go , you question with a wicked tongue .
shakespeare	hamlet	queen . why , how now , hamlet ? hamlet . what ’ s the matter now ? queen . have you forgot me ? hamlet . no , by the rood , not so . you are the queen , your husband ’ s brother ’ s wife , and , would it were not so . you are my mother .
shakespeare	hamlet	queen . nay , then i ’ ll set those to you that can speak . hamlet . come , come , and sit you down , you shall not budge . you go not till i set you up a glass where you may see the inmost part of you .

shakespeare	hamlet	[ _makes a pass through the arras._ ] polonius . [ _behind._ ] o , i am slain ! [ _falls and dies._ ] queen . o me , what hast thou done ? hamlet . nay , i know not . is it the king ?
shakespeare	hamlet	[ _draws forth polonius._ ] queen . o what a rash and bloody deed is this ! hamlet . a bloody deed . almost as bad , good mother , as kill a king and marry with his brother .
shakespeare	hamlet	queen . as kill a king ? hamlet . ay , lady , ’ twas my word.— [ _to polonius._ ] thou wretched , rash , intruding fool , farewell ! i took thee for thy better . take thy fortune , thou find ’ st to be too busy is some danger.— leave wringing of your hands . peace , sit you down , and let me wring your heart , for so i shall , if it be made of penetrable stuff ; if damned custom have not braz ’ d it so , that it is proof and bulwark against sense .
shakespeare	hamlet	queen . what have i done , that thou dar ’ st wag thy tongue in noise so rude against me ? hamlet . such an act that blurs the grace and blush of modesty , calls virtue hypocrite , takes off the rose from the fair forehead of an innocent love , and sets a blister there . makes marriage vows as false as dicers ’ oaths . o such a deed as from the body of contraction plucks the very soul , and sweet religion makes a rhapsody of words . heaven ’ s face doth glow , yea this solidity and compound mass , with tristful visage , as against the doom , is thought-sick at the act .
shakespeare	hamlet	queen . ay me , what act , that roars so loud , and thunders in the index ? hamlet . look here upon this picture , and on this , the counterfeit presentment of two brothers . see what a grace was seated on this brow , hyperion ’ s curls , the front of jove himself , an eye like mars , to threaten and command , a station like the herald mercury new lighted on a heaven-kissing hill : a combination and a form indeed , where every god did seem to set his seal , to give the world assurance of a man . this was your husband . look you now what follows . here is your husband , like a mildew ’ d ear blasting his wholesome brother . have you eyes ? could you on this fair mountain leave to feed , and batten on this moor ? ha ! have you eyes ? you can not call it love ; for at your age the hey-day in the blood is tame , it ’ s humble , and waits upon the judgment : and what judgment would step from this to this ? sense sure you have , else could you not have motion ; but sure that sense is apoplex ’ d , for madness would not err nor sense to ecstacy was ne ’ er so thrall ’ d but it reserv ’ d some quantity of choice to serve in such a difference . what devil was ’ t that thus hath cozen ’ d you at hoodman-blind ? eyes without feeling , feeling without sight , ears without hands or eyes , smelling sans all , or but a sickly part of one true sense could not so mope . o shame ! where is thy blush ? rebellious hell , if thou canst mutine in a matron ’ s bones , to flaming youth let virtue be as wax , and melt in her own fire . proclaim no shame when the compulsive ardour gives the charge , since frost itself as actively doth burn , and reason panders will .
shakespeare	hamlet	queen . o hamlet , speak no more . thou turn ’ st mine eyes into my very soul , and there i see such black and grained spots as will not leave their tinct . hamlet . nay , but to live in the rank sweat of an enseamed bed , stew ’ d in corruption , honeying and making love over the nasty sty .
shakespeare	hamlet	queen . o speak to me no more ; these words like daggers enter in mine ears ; no more , sweet hamlet . hamlet . a murderer and a villain ; a slave that is not twentieth part the tithe of your precedent lord . a vice of kings , a cutpurse of the empire and the rule , that from a shelf the precious diadem stole and put it in his pocket !
shakespeare	hamlet	queen . no more . hamlet . a king of shreds and patches ! — enter ghost . save me and hover o ’ er me with your wings , you heavenly guards ! what would your gracious figure ? queen . alas , he ’ s mad .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . do you not come your tardy son to chide , that , laps ’ d in time and passion , lets go by the important acting of your dread command ? o say ! ghost . do not forget . this visitation is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose . but look , amazement on thy mother sits . o step between her and her fighting soul . conceit in weakest bodies strongest works . speak to her , hamlet .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . how is it with you , lady ? queen . alas , how is ’ t with you , that you do bend your eye on vacancy , and with the incorporal air do hold discourse ? forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep , and , as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm , your bedded hairs , like life in excrements , start up and stand an end . o gentle son , upon the heat and flame of thy distemper sprinkle cool patience . whereon do you look ?
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . on him , on him ! look you how pale he glares , his form and cause conjoin ’ d , preaching to stones , would make them capable.—do not look upon me , lest with this piteous action you convert my stern effects . then what i have to do will want true colour ; tears perchance for blood .
shakespeare	hamlet	queen . to whom do you speak this ? hamlet . do you see nothing there ? queen . nothing at all ; yet all that is i see . hamlet . nor did you nothing hear ? queen . no , nothing but ourselves .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . why , look you there ! look how it steals away ! my father , in his habit as he liv ’ d ! look where he goes even now out at the portal . [ _exit ghost._ ]
shakespeare	hamlet	queen . this is the very coinage of your brain . this bodiless creation ecstasy is very cunning in . hamlet . ecstasy ! my pulse as yours doth temperately keep time , and makes as healthful music . it is not madness that i have utter ’ d . bring me to the test , and i the matter will re-word ; which madness would gambol from . mother , for love of grace , lay not that flattering unction to your soul that not your trespass , but my madness speaks . it will but skin and film the ulcerous place , whilst rank corruption , mining all within , infects unseen . confess yourself to heaven , repent what ’ s past , avoid what is to come ; and do not spread the compost on the weeds , to make them ranker . forgive me this my virtue ; for in the fatness of these pursy times virtue itself of vice must pardon beg , yea , curb and woo for leave to do him good .
shakespeare	hamlet	queen . o hamlet , thou hast cleft my heart in twain . hamlet . o throw away the worser part of it , and live the purer with the other half . good night . but go not to mine uncle ’ s bed . assume a virtue , if you have it not . that monster custom , who all sense doth eat , of habits evil , is angel yet in this , that to the use of actions fair and good he likewise gives a frock or livery that aptly is put on . refrain tonight , and that shall lend a kind of easiness to the next abstinence . the next more easy ; for use almost can change the stamp of nature , and either curb the devil , or throw him out with wondrous potency . once more , good night , and when you are desirous to be bles ’ d , i ’ ll blessing beg of you . for this same lord [ _pointing to polonius._ ] i do repent ; but heaven hath pleas ’ d it so , to punish me with this , and this with me , that i must be their scourge and minister . i will bestow him , and will answer well the death i gave him . so again , good night . i must be cruel , only to be kind : thus bad begins , and worse remains behind . one word more , good lady .
shakespeare	hamlet	queen . what shall i do ? hamlet . not this , by no means , that i bid you do : let the bloat king tempt you again to bed , pinch wanton on your cheek , call you his mouse , and let him , for a pair of reechy kisses , or paddling in your neck with his damn ’ d fingers , make you to ravel all this matter out , that i essentially am not in madness , but mad in craft . ’ twere good you let him know , for who that ’ s but a queen , fair , sober , wise , would from a paddock , from a bat , a gib , such dear concernings hide ? who would do so ? no , in despite of sense and secrecy , unpeg the basket on the house ’ s top , let the birds fly , and like the famous ape , to try conclusions , in the basket creep and break your own neck down .
shakespeare	hamlet	queen . be thou assur ’ d , if words be made of breath , and breath of life , i have no life to breathe what thou hast said to me . hamlet . i must to england , you know that ?

shakespeare	hamlet	queen . mad as the sea and wind , when both contend which is the mightier . in his lawless fit behind the arras hearing something stir , whips out his rapier , cries ‘ a rat , a rat ! ’ and in this brainish apprehension kills the unseen good old man .
shakespeare	hamlet	king . o heavy deed ! it had been so with us , had we been there . his liberty is full of threats to all ; to you yourself , to us , to everyone . alas , how shall this bloody deed be answer ’ d ? it will be laid to us , whose providence should have kept short , restrain ’ d , and out of haunt this mad young man . but so much was our love we would not understand what was most fit , but like the owner of a foul disease , to keep it from divulging , let it feed even on the pith of life . where is he gone ?

shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . do not believe it . rosencrantz . believe what ? hamlet . that i can keep your counsel , and not mine own . besides , to be demanded of a sponge—what replication should be made by the son of a king ?
shakespeare	hamlet	rosencrantz . take you me for a sponge , my lord ? hamlet . ay , sir ; that soaks up the king ’ s countenance , his rewards , his authorities . but such officers do the king best service in the end : he keeps them , like an ape , in the corner of his jaw ; first mouthed , to be last swallowed : when he needs what you have gleaned , it is but squeezing you , and , sponge , you shall be dry again .
shakespeare	hamlet	rosencrantz . i understand you not , my lord . hamlet . i am glad of it . a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear . rosencrantz . my lord , you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the king .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . the body is with the king , but the king is not with the body . the king is a thing— guildenstern . a thing , my lord ! hamlet . of nothing . bring me to him . hide fox , and all after .

shakespeare	hamlet	laertes . it well appears . but tell me why you proceeded not against these feats , so crimeful and so capital in nature , as by your safety , wisdom , all things else , you mainly were stirr ’ d up .
shakespeare	hamlet	king . o , for two special reasons , which may to you , perhaps , seem much unsinew ’ d , but yet to me they are strong . the queen his mother lives almost by his looks ; and for myself , — my virtue or my plague , be it either which , — she ’ s so conjunctive to my life and soul , that , as the star moves not but in his sphere , i could not but by her . the other motive , why to a public count i might not go , is the great love the general gender bear him , who , dipping all his faults in their affection , would like the spring that turneth wood to stone , convert his gyves to graces ; so that my arrows , too slightly timber ’ d for so loud a wind , would have reverted to my bow again , and not where i had aim ’ d them .
shakespeare	hamlet	laertes . and so have i a noble father lost , a sister driven into desperate terms , whose worth , if praises may go back again , stood challenger on mount of all the age for her perfections . but my revenge will come .
shakespeare	hamlet	king . break not your sleeps for that . you must not think that we are made of stuff so flat and dull that we can let our beard be shook with danger , and think it pastime . you shortly shall hear more . i lov ’ d your father , and we love ourself , and that , i hope , will teach you to imagine—

shakespeare	hamlet	laertes . i am lost in it , my lord . but let him come , it warms the very sickness in my heart that i shall live and tell him to his teeth , ‘ thus diest thou . ’
shakespeare	hamlet	king . if it be so , laertes , — as how should it be so ? how otherwise ? — will you be rul ’ d by me ? laertes . ay , my lord ; so you will not o ’ errule me to a peace .
shakespeare	hamlet	king . to thine own peace . if he be now return ’ d , as checking at his voyage , and that he means no more to undertake it , i will work him to exploit , now ripe in my device , under the which he shall not choose but fall ; and for his death no wind shall breathe , but even his mother shall uncharge the practice and call it accident .
shakespeare	hamlet	laertes . my lord , i will be rul ’ d ; the rather if you could devise it so that i might be the organ . king . it falls right . you have been talk ’ d of since your travel much , and that in hamlet ’ s hearing , for a quality wherein they say you shine . your sum of parts did not together pluck such envy from him as did that one , and that , in my regard , of the unworthiest siege .
shakespeare	hamlet	laertes . what part is that , my lord ? king . a very riband in the cap of youth , yet needful too , for youth no less becomes the light and careless livery that it wears than settled age his sables and his weeds , importing health and graveness . two months since here was a gentleman of normandy , — i ’ ve seen myself , and serv ’ d against , the french , and they can well on horseback , but this gallant had witchcraft in ’ t . he grew unto his seat , and to such wondrous doing brought his horse , as had he been incorps ’ d and demi-natur ’ d with the brave beast . so far he topp ’ d my thought that i in forgery of shapes and tricks , come short of what he did .

shakespeare	hamlet	laertes . what out of this , my lord ? king . laertes , was your father dear to you ? or are you like the painting of a sorrow , a face without a heart ? laertes . why ask you this ?
shakespeare	hamlet	king . not that i think you did not love your father , but that i know love is begun by time , and that i see , in passages of proof , time qualifies the spark and fire of it . there lives within the very flame of love a kind of wick or snuff that will abate it ; and nothing is at a like goodness still , for goodness , growing to a pleurisy , dies in his own too much . that we would do , we should do when we would ; for this ‘ would ’ changes , and hath abatements and delays as many as there are tongues , are hands , are accidents ; and then this ‘ should ’ is like a spendthrift sigh that hurts by easing . but to the quick o ’ th ’ ulcer : hamlet comes back : what would you undertake to show yourself your father ’ s son in deed , more than in words ?
shakespeare	hamlet	laertes . to cut his throat i ’ th ’ church . king . no place , indeed , should murder sanctuarize ; revenge should have no bounds . but good laertes , will you do this , keep close within your chamber . hamlet return ’ d shall know you are come home : we ’ ll put on those shall praise your excellence , and set a double varnish on the fame the frenchman gave you , bring you in fine together and wager on your heads . he , being remiss , most generous , and free from all contriving , will not peruse the foils ; so that with ease , or with a little shuffling , you may choose a sword unbated , and in a pass of practice , requite him for your father .
shakespeare	hamlet	laertes . i will do ’ t . and for that purpose i ’ ll anoint my sword . i bought an unction of a mountebank so mortal that , but dip a knife in it , where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare , collected from all simples that have virtue under the moon , can save the thing from death this is but scratch ’ d withal . i ’ ll touch my point with this contagion , that if i gall him slightly , it may be death .
shakespeare	hamlet	king . let ’ s further think of this , weigh what convenience both of time and means may fit us to our shape . if this should fail , and that our drift look through our bad performance . ’ twere better not assay ’ d . therefore this project should have a back or second , that might hold if this did blast in proof . soft , let me see . we ’ ll make a solemn wager on your cunnings , — i ha ’ t ! when in your motion you are hot and dry , as make your bouts more violent to that end , and that he calls for drink , i ’ ll have prepar ’ d him a chalice for the nonce ; whereon but sipping , if he by chance escape your venom ’ d stuck , our purpose may hold there .

shakespeare	hamlet	laertes . alas , then she is drown ’ d ? queen . drown ’ d , drown ’ d . laertes . too much of water hast thou , poor ophelia , and therefore i forbid my tears . but yet it is our trick ; nature her custom holds , let shame say what it will . when these are gone , the woman will be out . adieu , my lord , i have a speech of fire , that fain would blaze , but that this folly douts it .

shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . there ’ s another . why may not that be the skull of a lawyer ? where be his quiddits now , his quillets , his cases , his tenures , and his tricks ? why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel , and will not tell him of his action of battery ? hum . this fellow might be in ’ s time a great buyer of land , with his statutes , his recognizances , his fines , his double vouchers , his recoveries . is this the fine of his fines , and the recovery of his recoveries , to have his fine pate full of fine dirt ? will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases , and double ones too , than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures ? the very conveyances of his lands will scarcely lie in this box ; and must the inheritor himself have no more , ha ?
shakespeare	hamlet	horatio . not a jot more , my lord . hamlet . is not parchment made of sheep-skins ? horatio . ay , my lord , and of calf-skins too . hamlet . they are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that . i will speak to this fellow.—whose grave ’ s this , sir ?
shakespeare	hamlet	first clown . mine , sir . [ _sings._ ] o , a pit of clay for to be made for such a guest is meet . hamlet . i think it be thine indeed , for thou liest in ’ t .
shakespeare	hamlet	first clown . you lie out on ’ t , sir , and therefore ’ tis not yours . for my part , i do not lie in ’ t , yet it is mine . hamlet . thou dost lie in ’ t , to be in ’ t and say it is thine . ’ tis for the dead , not for the quick ; therefore thou liest .
shakespeare	hamlet	first clown . ’ tis a quick lie , sir ; ’ t will away again from me to you . hamlet . what man dost thou dig it for ? first clown . for no man , sir . hamlet . what woman then ?
shakespeare	hamlet	first clown . for none neither . hamlet . who is to be buried in ’ t ? first clown . one that was a woman , sir ; but , rest her soul , she ’ s dead . hamlet . how absolute the knave is ! we must speak by the card , or equivocation will undo us . by the lord , horatio , these three years i have taken note of it , the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe.—how long hast thou been a grave-maker ?
shakespeare	hamlet	first clown . of all the days i ’ th ’ year , i came to ’ t that day that our last king hamlet o ’ ercame fortinbras . hamlet . how long is that since ? first clown . can not you tell that ? every fool can tell that . it was the very day that young hamlet was born , —he that is mad , and sent into england .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . ay , marry , why was he sent into england ? first clown . why , because he was mad ; he shall recover his wits there ; or if he do not , it ’ s no great matter there .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . why ? first clown . ’ twill not be seen in him there ; there the men are as mad as he . hamlet . how came he mad ? first clown . very strangely , they say .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . how strangely ? first clown . faith , e ’ en with losing his wits . hamlet . upon what ground ? first clown . why , here in denmark . i have been sexton here , man and boy , thirty years .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . how long will a man lie i ’ th ’ earth ere he rot ? first clown . faith , if he be not rotten before he die , —as we have many pocky corses nowadays that will scarce hold the laying in , —he will last you some eight year or nine year . a tanner will last you nine year .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . why he more than another ? first clown . why , sir , his hide is so tann ’ d with his trade that he will keep out water a great while . and your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body . here ’ s a skull now ; this skull hath lain in the earth three-and-twenty years .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . whose was it ? first clown . a whoreson , mad fellow ’ s it was . whose do you think it was ? hamlet . nay , i know not . first clown . a pestilence on him for a mad rogue ! a pour ’ d a flagon of rhenish on my head once . this same skull , sir , was yorick ’ s skull , the king ’ s jester .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . this ? first clown . e ’ en that . hamlet . let me see . [ _takes the skull._ ] alas , poor yorick . i knew him , horatio , a fellow of infinite jest , of most excellent fancy . he hath borne me on his back a thousand times ; and now , how abhorred in my imagination it is ! my gorge rises at it . here hung those lips that i have kiss ’ d i know not how oft . where be your gibes now ? your gambols ? your songs ? your flashes of merriment , that were wont to set the table on a roar ? not one now , to mock your own grinning ? quite chop-fallen ? now get you to my lady ’ s chamber , and tell her , let her paint an inch thick , to this favour she must come . make her laugh at that.—prythee , horatio , tell me one thing .
shakespeare	hamlet	horatio . what ’ s that , my lord ? hamlet . dost thou think alexander looked o ’ this fashion i ’ th ’ earth ? horatio . e ’ en so . hamlet . and smelt so ? pah ! [ _throws down the skull._ ] horatio . e ’ en so , my lord .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . to what base uses we may return , horatio ! why may not imagination trace the noble dust of alexander till he find it stopping a bung-hole ? horatio . ’ twere to consider too curiously to consider so .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . no , faith , not a jot . but to follow him thither with modesty enough , and likelihood to lead it ; as thus . alexander died , alexander was buried , alexander returneth into dust ; the dust is earth ; of earth we make loam ; and why of that loam whereto he was converted might they not stop a beer-barrel ? imperious caesar , dead and turn ’ d to clay , might stop a hole to keep the wind away . o , that that earth which kept the world in awe should patch a wall t ’ expel the winter ’ s flaw . but soft ! but soft ! aside ! here comes the king .
shakespeare	hamlet	enter priests , & c , in procession ; the corpse of ophelia , laertes and mourners following ; king , queen , their trains , & c. the queen , the courtiers . who is that they follow ? and with such maimed rites ? this doth betoken the corse they follow did with desperate hand fordo it own life . ’ twas of some estate . couch we awhile and mark .
shakespeare	hamlet	[ _retiring with horatio._ ] laertes . what ceremony else ? hamlet . that is laertes , a very noble youth . mark . laertes . what ceremony else ? priest . her obsequies have been as far enlarg ’ d as we have warranties . her death was doubtful ; and but that great command o ’ ersways the order , she should in ground unsanctified have lodg ’ d till the last trumpet . for charitable prayers , shards , flints , and pebbles should be thrown on her . yet here she is allowed her virgin rites , her maiden strewments , and the bringing home of bell and burial .
shakespeare	hamlet	laertes . must there no more be done ? priest . no more be done . we should profane the service of the dead to sing sage requiem and such rest to her as to peace-parted souls .
shakespeare	hamlet	laertes . lay her i ’ th ’ earth , and from her fair and unpolluted flesh may violets spring . i tell thee , churlish priest , a minist ’ ring angel shall my sister be when thou liest howling .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . what , the fair ophelia ? queen . [ _scattering flowers._ ] sweets to the sweet . farewell . i hop ’ d thou shouldst have been my hamlet ’ s wife ; i thought thy bride-bed to have deck ’ d , sweet maid , and not have strew ’ d thy grave .
shakespeare	hamlet	laertes . o , treble woe fall ten times treble on that cursed head whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense depriv ’ d thee of . hold off the earth a while , till i have caught her once more in mine arms . [ _leaps into the grave._ ] now pile your dust upon the quick and dead , till of this flat a mountain you have made , to o ’ ertop old pelion or the skyish head of blue olympus .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . [ _advancing._ ] what is he whose grief bears such an emphasis ? whose phrase of sorrow conjures the wand ’ ring stars , and makes them stand like wonder-wounded hearers ? this is i , hamlet the dane . [ _leaps into the grave._ ]
shakespeare	hamlet	laertes . [ _grappling with him._ ] the devil take thy soul ! hamlet . thou pray ’ st not well . i prythee take thy fingers from my throat ; for though i am not splenative and rash , yet have i in me something dangerous , which let thy wiseness fear . away thy hand !
shakespeare	hamlet	king . pluck them asunder . queen . hamlet ! hamlet ! all . gentlemen ! horatio . good my lord , be quiet . [ _the attendants part them , and they come out of the grave._ ] hamlet . why , i will fight with him upon this theme until my eyelids will no longer wag .
shakespeare	hamlet	queen . o my son , what theme ? hamlet . i lov ’ d ophelia ; forty thousand brothers could not , with all their quantity of love , make up my sum . what wilt thou do for her ?
shakespeare	hamlet	king . o , he is mad , laertes . queen . for love of god forbear him ! hamlet . ’ swounds , show me what thou ’ lt do : woul ’ t weep ? woul ’ t fight ? woul ’ t fast ? woul ’ t tear thyself ? woul ’ t drink up eisel ? eat a crocodile ? i ’ ll do ’ t . dost thou come here to whine ? to outface me with leaping in her grave ? be buried quick with her , and so will i . and if thou prate of mountains , let them throw millions of acres on us , till our ground , singeing his pate against the burning zone , make ossa like a wart . nay , an thou ’ lt mouth , i ’ ll rant as well as thou .
shakespeare	hamlet	queen . this is mere madness : and thus awhile the fit will work on him ; anon , as patient as the female dove , when that her golden couplets are disclos ’ d , his silence will sit drooping .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . hear you , sir ; what is the reason that you use me thus ? i lov ’ d you ever . but it is no matter . let hercules himself do what he may , the cat will mew , and dog will have his day .
shakespeare	hamlet	[ _exit._ ] king . i pray thee , good horatio , wait upon him . [ _exit horatio._ ] [ _to laertes_ ] strengthen your patience in our last night ’ s speech ; we ’ ll put the matter to the present push.— good gertrude , set some watch over your son . this grave shall have a living monument . an hour of quiet shortly shall we see ; till then in patience our proceeding be .
shakespeare	hamlet	[ _exeunt._ ] scene ii . a hall in the castle . enter hamlet and horatio . hamlet . so much for this , sir . now let me see the other ; you do remember all the circumstance ?
shakespeare	hamlet	horatio . remember it , my lord ! hamlet . sir , in my heart there was a kind of fighting that would not let me sleep . methought i lay worse than the mutinies in the bilboes . rashly , and prais ’ d be rashness for it , —let us know , our indiscretion sometime serves us well , when our deep plots do pall ; and that should teach us there ’ s a divinity that shapes our ends , rough-hew them how we will .
shakespeare	hamlet	horatio . that is most certain . hamlet . up from my cabin , my sea-gown scarf ’ d about me , in the dark grop ’ d i to find out them ; had my desire , finger ’ d their packet , and in fine , withdrew to mine own room again , making so bold , my fears forgetting manners , to unseal their grand commission ; where i found , horatio , oh royal knavery ! an exact command , larded with many several sorts of reasons , importing denmark ’ s health , and england ’ s too , with ho ! such bugs and goblins in my life , that on the supervise , no leisure bated , no , not to stay the grinding of the axe , my head should be struck off .
shakespeare	hamlet	horatio . is ’ t possible ? hamlet . here ’ s the commission , read it at more leisure . but wilt thou hear me how i did proceed ? horatio . i beseech you . hamlet . being thus benetted round with villanies , — or i could make a prologue to my brains , they had begun the play , —i sat me down , devis ’ d a new commission , wrote it fair : i once did hold it , as our statists do , a baseness to write fair , and labour ’ d much how to forget that learning ; but , sir , now it did me yeoman ’ s service . wilt thou know the effect of what i wrote ?
shakespeare	hamlet	horatio . ay , good my lord . hamlet . an earnest conjuration from the king , as england was his faithful tributary , as love between them like the palm might flourish , as peace should still her wheaten garland wear and stand a comma ’ tween their amities , and many such-like ‘ as ’ es of great charge , that on the view and know of these contents , without debatement further , more or less , he should the bearers put to sudden death , not shriving-time allow ’ d .
shakespeare	hamlet	horatio . how was this seal ’ d ? hamlet . why , even in that was heaven ordinant . i had my father ’ s signet in my purse , which was the model of that danish seal : folded the writ up in the form of the other , subscrib ’ d it : gave ’ t th ’ impression ; plac ’ d it safely , the changeling never known . now , the next day was our sea-fight , and what to this was sequent thou know ’ st already .
shakespeare	hamlet	horatio . so guildenstern and rosencrantz go to ’ t . hamlet . why , man , they did make love to this employment . they are not near my conscience ; their defeat does by their own insinuation grow . ’ tis dangerous when the baser nature comes between the pass and fell incensed points of mighty opposites .
shakespeare	hamlet	horatio . why , what a king is this ! hamlet . does it not , thinks ’ t thee , stand me now upon , — he that hath kill ’ d my king , and whor ’ d my mother , popp ’ d in between th ’ election and my hopes , thrown out his angle for my proper life , and with such cozenage—is ’ t not perfect conscience to quit him with this arm ? and is ’ t not to be damn ’ d to let this canker of our nature come in further evil ?
shakespeare	hamlet	horatio . it must be shortly known to him from england what is the issue of the business there . hamlet . it will be short . the interim is mine ; and a man ’ s life ’ s no more than to say ‘ one ’ . but i am very sorry , good horatio , that to laertes i forgot myself ; for by the image of my cause i see the portraiture of his . i ’ ll court his favours . but sure the bravery of his grief did put me into a tow ’ ring passion .
shakespeare	hamlet	horatio . peace , who comes here ? enter osric . osric . your lordship is right welcome back to denmark . hamlet . i humbly thank you , sir . dost know this waterfly ? horatio . no , my good lord .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . thy state is the more gracious ; for ’ tis a vice to know him . he hath much land , and fertile ; let a beast be lord of beasts , and his crib shall stand at the king ’ s mess ; ’ tis a chough ; but , as i say , spacious in the possession of dirt .
shakespeare	hamlet	osric . sweet lord , if your lordship were at leisure , i should impart a thing to you from his majesty . hamlet . i will receive it with all diligence of spirit . put your bonnet to his right use ; ’ tis for the head .
shakespeare	hamlet	osric . i thank your lordship , ’ tis very hot . hamlet . no , believe me , ’ tis very cold , the wind is northerly . osric . it is indifferent cold , my lord , indeed . hamlet . methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion .
shakespeare	hamlet	osric . exceedingly , my lord ; it is very sultry , —as ’ twere—i can not tell how . but , my lord , his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head . sir , this is the matter , —
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . i beseech you , remember , — [ _hamlet moves him to put on his hat._ ] osric . nay , in good faith ; for mine ease , in good faith . sir , here is newly come to court laertes ; believe me , an absolute gentleman , full of most excellent differences , of very soft society and great showing . indeed , to speak feelingly of him , he is the card or calendar of gentry ; for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . sir , his definement suffers no perdition in you , though i know , to divide him inventorially would dizzy th ’ arithmetic of memory , and yet but yaw neither , in respect of his quick sail . but , in the verity of extolment , i take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as , to make true diction of him , his semblable is his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage , nothing more .
shakespeare	hamlet	osric . your lordship speaks most infallibly of him . hamlet . the concernancy , sir ? why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath ? osric . sir ? horatio . is ’ t not possible to understand in another tongue ? you will do ’ t , sir , really .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . what imports the nomination of this gentleman ? osric . of laertes ? horatio . his purse is empty already , all ’ s golden words are spent . hamlet . of him , sir . osric . i know you are not ignorant , —
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . i would you did , sir ; yet in faith if you did , it would not much approve me . well , sir ? osric . you are not ignorant of what excellence laertes is , —
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . i dare not confess that , lest i should compare with him in excellence ; but to know a man well were to know himself . osric . i mean , sir , for his weapon ; but in the imputation laid on him , by them in his meed he ’ s unfellowed .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . what ’ s his weapon ? osric . rapier and dagger . hamlet . that ’ s two of his weapons . but well . osric . the king , sir , hath wager ’ d with him six barbary horses , against the which he has imponed , as i take it , six french rapiers and poniards , with their assigns , as girdle , hangers , and so . three of the carriages , in faith , are very dear to fancy , very responsive to the hilts , most delicate carriages , and of very liberal conceit .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . what call you the carriages ? horatio . i knew you must be edified by the margin ere you had done . osric . the carriages , sir , are the hangers . hamlet . the phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides . i would it might be hangers till then . but on . six barbary horses against six french swords , their assigns , and three liberal conceited carriages : that ’ s the french bet against the danish . why is this all imponed , as you call it ?
shakespeare	hamlet	osric . the king , sir , hath laid that in a dozen passes between you and him , he shall not exceed you three hits . he hath laid on twelve for nine . and it would come to immediate trial if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . how if i answer no ? osric . i mean , my lord , the opposition of your person in trial . hamlet . sir , i will walk here in the hall . if it please his majesty , it is the breathing time of day with me . let the foils be brought , the gentleman willing , and the king hold his purpose , i will win for him if i can ; if not , i will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits .
shakespeare	hamlet	osric . shall i re-deliver you e ’ en so ? hamlet . to this effect , sir ; after what flourish your nature will . osric . i commend my duty to your lordship . hamlet . yours , yours . [ _exit osric._ ]
shakespeare	hamlet	he does well to commend it himself , there are no tongues else for ’ s turn . horatio . this lapwing runs away with the shell on his head . hamlet . he did comply with his dug before he suck ’ d it . thus has he , —and many more of the same bevy that i know the drossy age dotes on , — only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter ; a kind of yeasty collection , which carries them through and through the most fanned and winnowed opinions ; and do but blow them to their trial , the bubbles are out ,
shakespeare	hamlet	enter a lord . lord . my lord , his majesty commended him to you by young osric , who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall . he sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with laertes or that you will take longer time .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . i am constant to my purposes , they follow the king ’ s pleasure . if his fitness speaks , mine is ready . now or whensoever , provided i be so able as now . lord . the king and queen and all are coming down .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . in happy time . lord . the queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to laertes before you fall to play . hamlet . she well instructs me . [ _exit lord._ ] horatio . you will lose this wager , my lord .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . i do not think so . since he went into france , i have been in continual practice . i shall win at the odds . but thou wouldst not think how ill all ’ s here about my heart : but it is no matter .
shakespeare	hamlet	horatio . nay , good my lord . hamlet . it is but foolery ; but it is such a kind of gain-giving as would perhaps trouble a woman . horatio . if your mind dislike anything , obey it . i will forestall their repair hither , and say you are not fit .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . not a whit , we defy augury . there ’ s a special providence in the fall of a sparrow . if it be now , ’ tis not to come ; if it be not to come , it will be now ; if it be not now , yet it will come . the readiness is all . since no man has aught of what he leaves , what is ’ t to leave betimes ?
shakespeare	hamlet	enter king , queen , laertes , lords , osric and attendants with foils & c. king . come , hamlet , come , and take this hand from me . [ _the king puts laertes ’ s hand into hamlet ’ s._ ] hamlet . give me your pardon , sir . i have done you wrong ; but pardon ’ t as you are a gentleman . this presence knows , and you must needs have heard , how i am punish ’ d with sore distraction . what i have done that might your nature , honour , and exception roughly awake , i here proclaim was madness . was ’ t hamlet wrong ’ d laertes ? never hamlet . if hamlet from himself be ta ’ en away , and when he ’ s not himself does wrong laertes , then hamlet does it not , hamlet denies it . who does it , then ? his madness . if ’ t be so , hamlet is of the faction that is wrong ’ d ; his madness is poor hamlet ’ s enemy . sir , in this audience , let my disclaiming from a purpos ’ d evil free me so far in your most generous thoughts that i have shot my arrow o ’ er the house and hurt my brother .
shakespeare	hamlet	laertes . i am satisfied in nature , whose motive in this case should stir me most to my revenge . but in my terms of honour i stand aloof , and will no reconcilement till by some elder masters of known honour i have a voice and precedent of peace to keep my name ungor ’ d . but till that time i do receive your offer ’ d love like love , and will not wrong it .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . i embrace it freely , and will this brother ’ s wager frankly play.— give us the foils ; come on . laertes . come , one for me . hamlet . i ’ ll be your foil , laertes ; in mine ignorance your skill shall like a star i ’ th ’ darkest night , stick fiery off indeed .
shakespeare	hamlet	laertes . you mock me , sir . hamlet . no , by this hand . king . give them the foils , young osric . cousin hamlet , you know the wager ? hamlet . very well , my lord . your grace has laid the odds o ’ the weaker side .
shakespeare	hamlet	king . i do not fear it . i have seen you both ; but since he is better ’ d , we have therefore odds . laertes . this is too heavy . let me see another . hamlet . this likes me well . these foils have all a length ?
shakespeare	hamlet	[ _they prepare to play._ ] osric . ay , my good lord . king . set me the stoups of wine upon that table . if hamlet give the first or second hit , or quit in answer of the third exchange , let all the battlements their ordnance fire ; the king shall drink to hamlet ’ s better breath , and in the cup an union shall he throw richer than that which four successive kings in denmark ’ s crown have worn . give me the cups ; and let the kettle to the trumpet speak , the trumpet to the cannoneer without , the cannons to the heavens , the heavens to earth , ‘ now the king drinks to hamlet. ’ come , begin . and you , the judges , bear a wary eye .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . come on , sir . laertes . come , my lord . [ _they play._ ] hamlet . one . laertes . no . hamlet . judgment . osric . a hit , a very palpable hit . laertes . well ; again . king . stay , give me drink . hamlet , this pearl is thine ; here ’ s to thy health .
shakespeare	hamlet	[ _trumpets sound , and cannon shot off within._ ] give him the cup . hamlet . i ’ ll play this bout first ; set it by awhile . [ _they play._ ] come . another hit ; what say you ? laertes . a touch , a touch , i do confess .
shakespeare	hamlet	king . our son shall win . queen . he ’ s fat , and scant of breath . here , hamlet , take my napkin , rub thy brows . the queen carouses to thy fortune , hamlet . hamlet . good madam .
shakespeare	hamlet	king . gertrude , do not drink . queen . i will , my lord ; i pray you pardon me . king . [ _aside._ ] it is the poison ’ d cup ; it is too late . hamlet . i dare not drink yet , madam . by and by .
shakespeare	hamlet	queen . come , let me wipe thy face . laertes . my lord , i ’ ll hit him now . king . i do not think ’ t . laertes . [ _aside._ ] and yet ’ tis almost ’ gainst my conscience . hamlet . come for the third , laertes . you do but dally . i pray you pass with your best violence . i am afeard you make a wanton of me .
shakespeare	hamlet	laertes . say you so ? come on . [ _they play._ ] osric . nothing neither way . laertes . have at you now . [ _laertes wounds hamlet ; then , in scuffling , they change rapiers , and hamlet wounds laertes._ ]
shakespeare	hamlet	king . part them ; they are incens ’ d . hamlet . nay , come again ! [ _the queen falls._ ] osric . look to the queen there , ho ! horatio . they bleed on both sides . how is it , my lord ?
shakespeare	hamlet	osric . how is ’ t , laertes ? laertes . why , as a woodcock to my own springe , osric . i am justly kill ’ d with mine own treachery . hamlet . how does the queen ? king . she swoons to see them bleed .
shakespeare	hamlet	queen . no , no , the drink , the drink ! o my dear hamlet ! the drink , the drink ! i am poison ’ d . [ _dies._ ] hamlet . o villany ! ho ! let the door be lock ’ d : treachery ! seek it out .
shakespeare	hamlet	[ _laertes falls._ ] laertes . it is here , hamlet . hamlet , thou art slain . no medicine in the world can do thee good . in thee there is not half an hour of life ; the treacherous instrument is in thy hand , unbated and envenom ’ d . the foul practice hath turn ’ d itself on me . lo , here i lie , never to rise again . thy mother ’ s poison ’ d . i can no more . the king , the king ’ s to blame .
shakespeare	hamlet	hamlet . the point envenom ’ d too ! then , venom , to thy work . [ _stabs the king._ ] osric and lords . treason ! treason ! king . o yet defend me , friends . i am but hurt . hamlet . here , thou incestuous , murderous , damned dane , drink off this potion . is thy union here ? follow my mother .
shakespeare	hamlet	[ _king dies._ ] laertes . he is justly serv ’ d . it is a poison temper ’ d by himself . exchange forgiveness with me , noble hamlet . mine and my father ’ s death come not upon thee , nor thine on me .
shakespeare	hamlet	[ _dies._ ] hamlet . heaven make thee free of it ! i follow thee . i am dead , horatio . wretched queen , adieu . you that look pale and tremble at this chance , that are but mutes or audience to this act , had i but time , —as this fell sergeant , death , is strict in his arrest , —o , i could tell you , — but let it be . horatio , i am dead , thou liv ’ st ; report me and my cause aright to the unsatisfied .
shakespeare	hamlet	horatio . never believe it . i am more an antique roman than a dane . here ’ s yet some liquor left . hamlet . as th ’ art a man , give me the cup . let go ; by heaven , i ’ ll have ’ t . o good horatio , what a wounded name , things standing thus unknown , shall live behind me . if thou didst ever hold me in thy heart , absent thee from felicity awhile , and in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain , to tell my story .
shakespeare	hamlet	[ _march afar off , and shot within._ ] what warlike noise is this ? osric . young fortinbras , with conquest come from poland , to the ambassadors of england gives this warlike volley . hamlet . o , i die , horatio . the potent poison quite o ’ er-crows my spirit : i can not live to hear the news from england , but i do prophesy th ’ election lights on fortinbras . he has my dying voice . so tell him , with the occurrents more and less , which have solicited . the rest is silence .
shakespeare	hamlet	[ _dies._ ] horatio . now cracks a noble heart . good night , sweet prince , and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest . why does the drum come hither ? [ _march within._ ] enter fortinbras , the english ambassadors and others .
shakespeare	hamlet	fortinbras . where is this sight ? horatio . what is it you would see ? if aught of woe or wonder , cease your search . fortinbras . this quarry cries on havoc . o proud death , what feast is toward in thine eternal cell , that thou so many princes at a shot so bloodily hast struck ?
shakespeare	hamlet	first ambassador . the sight is dismal ; and our affairs from england come too late . the ears are senseless that should give us hearing , to tell him his commandment is fulfill ’ d , that rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead . where should we have our thanks ?
shakespeare	hamlet	horatio . not from his mouth , had it th ’ ability of life to thank you . he never gave commandment for their death . but since , so jump upon this bloody question , you from the polack wars , and you from england are here arriv ’ d , give order that these bodies high on a stage be placed to the view , and let me speak to th ’ yet unknowing world how these things came about . so shall you hear of carnal , bloody and unnatural acts , of accidental judgments , casual slaughters , of deaths put on by cunning and forc ’ d cause , and , in this upshot , purposes mistook fall ’ n on the inventors ’ heads . all this can i truly deliver .
shakespeare	hamlet	fortinbras . let us haste to hear it , and call the noblest to the audience . for me , with sorrow i embrace my fortune . i have some rights of memory in this kingdom , which now to claim my vantage doth invite me .
shakespeare	hamlet	horatio . of that i shall have also cause to speak , and from his mouth whose voice will draw on more . but let this same be presently perform ’ d , even while men ’ s minds are wild , lest more mischance on plots and errors happen .
shakespeare	hamlet	fortinbras . let four captains bear hamlet like a soldier to the stage , for he was likely , had he been put on , to have prov ’ d most royally ; and for his passage , the soldiers ’ music and the rites of war speak loudly for him . take up the bodies . such a sight as this becomes the field , but here shows much amiss . go , bid the soldiers shoot .
